About the word 'Lord'

%e word lord in English has several related meanings. The
original meaning is 'master' or 'ruler', and in this sense it is often
used to refer to human beings: 'the lord of the mansion' or 'Lord Soand-So' (in the United Kingdom, for example). The word Lord with a
capital L is used in the lexicon of Islam to refer to the One and Only
God-Allah. In Islam, there is no ambiguity about the meaning of this
word. While it is true that one may occasionally use the word lord
(whether capitalized or not) to refer to a human being, in I s l m c
discourse the reference of this term is always clear from the context.
Whereas for Christians, Hindus and other polytheists, the word Lord
with a capital L may refer to Allah, to Jesus or to some imagined
deity, for Muslims, there can be no plurality of meaning. Allah alone
is the Lord, and the Lord is Allah
not Jesus, not Rama, not any
other being.

11 praise and thanks belong to Allah alone, the One, the
Almighty, and AU-Merciful. Blessings and peace be upon Prophet
Muhammad, the last of His Messengers and Prophets, his family, his
Companions and all those who follow in his footsteps until the end of
time.
'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) was the cousin and close companion
the beloved husband of the Prophet's daughter
of the Prophet (g),
Fatimah (I&), the father of al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and the fourth of
the ~ightly-guidedCaliphs who led the Muslim nation after the
Prophet's death. Dr. Ali M. Sallabi has sifted through the numerous
reports of this period to produce this authentic biography in which he
skilfully describes 'Ali's character and recounts the significant
incidents in his life, especially regarding the turmoil that enveloped
the Muslim nation during his caliphate.
Inshallah this book will enable the readers to form an accurate
picture of this noble figure in Islamic history so that they will not be
misled by false allegations and distortions about this era, which are
widespread and have repercussions in the Muslim world even today.
We also hope that the book will allow the readers to develop a hue
understanding of what it means to love the family of the Prophet (g).
May AUah Mess the efforts of all who contributed to the
production of this book, and may it be acceptable to Him, imeen.

Translator's Foreword

(?L1

this book, Dr. Sallibi presents the biography of the fonrth
caliph of Islam and examines in detail the momentous turmoil and
conflicts that prevailed during that period in the history of the
Ummah. These issues and events still have repercussions today.
Using authentic, sound hadiths and reports, the author depicts
the life and times of 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (rudiya Allrihu hnhu - may
Allah be pleased with him). Even though 'Ali's caliphate is regarded
as an extension of the Rightly Guided caliphate, in the sense that the
system of government and leadership followed the way of the
Messenger of Allah (Salla Allcihu 'alayhi wa sallam -blessings and
peace be upon him) and the three preceding caliphs, it was marked by
important differences because 'Ali (&) was faced with the
unprecedented danger that engulfed the Umrnah after the murder of
'Uthmin (&). Thus 'Ali (&) was compelled to focus all his efforts
on seeking to keep the Ummah united and dealing with the extreme
views and groups, such as the Kharijites and Rzfias, that began to
emerge as a result of the turmoil.
The author highlights in detail the role of Abdullah ibn Saba'
and his followers in stirring up unrest. He examines the parts they
played in the conspiracy against 'Uthm2n (&) that ended in his
murder, in sparking the Battle of Camel &r the two sides had
reached a peace deal, and in introducing extreme views concerning
Ah1 al-Bayt [the family of the Prophet Muhammad (%)I - views
that the R a e Shia still believe in.
As a result of these internal pressures, the expansion of the
Islamic state came to a standstill during the caliphate of 'Ali (&),
. ., as

22

Translator'sforeword

he was preoccupied with confronting the raging m e s t and conflicts.
The positive outcome of this situation was that 'Ali (&) set an
example of the ideal way of dealing with Muslim opponents and with
extreme Muslim elements in times of discord. He demonstrated that
the way to deal with Muslim adversaries is not by labelling them
disbelievers; throughout the conflict, he insisted that his opponents
were Muslims, and that the rules of engagement with a Muslim
adversary were different from those that apply when fighting the
disbelievers. If they are Muslims, their wounded are not to be killed,
their fighters who flee the battlefield are not to be pursued, their
womenfolk and children are not to be taken captive, and their wealth
and property are not to be seized.
In the course of researching this book, Dr. Salliibi read through
an enormous number of hadiths and reports referring to the time of
turmoil, exposing the many false reports that were fabricated by the
Rsfidi Shia and their ilk in an attempt to distort the image of senior
Companions such as 'kishah, Tabah, az-Zubayr, Mu'iiwiyah and
'Amr ibn al-'.&$ (may AUah be pleased with them all). These false
reports depicted those noble figures as petty-minded individuals
whose main concern was the acquisition of power and wealth. On the
basis of sound, authentic reports, the author proves that the dispute
between these groups of Companions was due to genuine
misunderstanding and the fact that they held different views, which
each of them sincerely believed were right and proper.
A major portion of the book is devoted to a discussion of the
views and beliefs of the RZfiPi Shia, confirming that these positions
are contrary to the views of 'Ali ibn Abi r t l b (&) himself. The
members of Ah1 al-Bayt rejected these views and regarded them as
heresy and extremism.
This book comes at a time when the RZfidi Shia are striving to
propagate their misguided beliefs and ideas throughout the world,

under the banner of love for Ah1 d-Bayt. We are confident that this
book will become a major reference for the English-speaking Muslim
world and will help Muslims to preserve their sound beliefs and to
stand up against corrnpt, misguided notions, so that they will cling
more strongly to the path of the Messenger of AUah (gJ,
Abu Bakr,
'Umar, 'Uthmk, 'Ali, the rest of the Companions and Ah1 d-Bayt
(may Allah be pleased with them all).

We seek refuge with Allah (g)

This book is the fourth in a series on the era of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs. The three books that were published previously are
the biographies of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, 'Umar ibn al-KhattSb d Farooq and 'Uthrn2n ibn 'Af& Dbun-Noorayn (may Allah be
pleased with them all). This book encompasses the life of Amir alMu'mineen (Commander of the Faithful) 'Ali ibn Ab'i T%b (&)
from his birth until his martyrdom. It begins with a discussion of his
name, lineage, titles, birth, family and tribe.
It describes how he came to Islam and his most important
actions in Makkah, his migration to Madinah and how he lived under
the influence of the Holy Qur'an and the impact it had on his life. It
explains his concept of Allah (s),
the universe, life, paradise, hell
and the divine will and decree; the status of the Holy Qur'an in his
view; what was revealed of Qur'an concerning him; the principles
and fundamentals that Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Alifollowed in deriving
rulings from the Holy Qur'an and how he interpreted its meanings;
and his interpretation of some verses. It tells how he stayed close to
the Messenger of Allah (g)
from his childhood; his deep knowledge
of the statns of prophethood and how he interacted with it, as
explained through his words and deeds. He was keen to teach the
people and to encourage them to follow the example of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
in his words and deeds and what he
approved of. He stated that it is obligatory to obey the Prophet (g)
and to adhere to and preserve his Sunnah. He explained the proof of

Introduction

I

the prophethood of the Messenger (g),
his virtnes and some of the
rights that he has over his Ummah. The reader will find examples of
the ways in which Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) followed the
Sunnah of the Prophet, as well as the names of some of those who
narrated from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Mi (&) among the
Companions, the t&bi'oonl and the members of his household.
The book then moves on to the life of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ah
(&) in Madinah at the time of the Prophet (@). It discusses his
marriage to as-Sayyidah Fiicimah
and the lessons we can learn
from this marriage about the hGdal gift, trousseau, wedding
celebration, life and asceticism, as well as Fiitimah's sincerity and
leadership in this world and the hereafter. I have also included brief
biographies of 'Ali's sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn (may Allah he
pleased with them), mentioning their virtues and the hadiths that
were narrated from the Messenger of Allah (g)
- concerning them. I
discuss the concept of Ah1 al-Bayt (the people of the Prophet's
family) among Sunni Muslims, and the rulings that apply specifically
to them, such as the prohibition on their accepting zak&h the fact
that they were not allowed to inherit from the Messenger of Allah
@), their entitlement to one-fifth of the war booty, sending blessings
upon them as well as upon the Prophet (B),and the obligation to
love and respect them.

I examine the exploits of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
in his
campaigns and battles alongside the Messenger of Allah (g),
such as
Badr, Uhud, al-Khandaq (the Trench), Banu Quraydhah,
Hudaybiyah, Khaybar, the conquest of Makkah and Hunayn;
how the Prophet (g)
., put 'Ali (&) in charge of Madinah dnring the
campaign to Tabook in 8 AH; his media role3 when Abu Balcr (&)
led the people on hajj; the delegation of the Christians of Najriin &d
the verse4 in which the Christians are challenged to come together
with the Prophet
bringing their fanlilies, to pray to Allah and

a,),

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

invoke His curse on those who are lying; the Prophet's sending 'Ali
(&) to Yemen as a preacher of Islam and a judge, and the rulings
that he gave in Yemen; the actions of 'Ali (&) during the farewell
pilgrimage; the letter that the Prophet (@) thought of writing dnring
his final illness; 'Ali's relationship with the other Rightly Guided
Caliphs and his position during their caliphates.
I descrihe his swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (&) as caliph,
his support for Abu Bakr during the Wars of Apostasy, his respect for
and giving precedence to Abu Bakr, and his praying behind him and
accepting gifts from him. I refer to the relationship between Abu
Bakr (&) and Fgtimah (r&), and the story of the estate of the
Prophet (g).
I refnte the sp&ious arguments of the RZfidisabout this
incident, exposing their weak and fabricated reports, and I provide
definitive proof and clear evidence to rebut their contentions.

(a)

I prove the love that Fgtimah
had for the trnth and her
adherence to Sharia. I give examples th& demonstrate her respect for
the successor of the Prophet (g),
the caliph Abu Bakr (&); her
tolerant attitude towards him, the respect of Ah1 al-Bayt for Abu Bakr
(&); intermarriage between the family of Abu Bakr and Ah1 alBayt; their love for him and their naming their children after him. I
speak of the contribution that 'Ali (&) made during the caliphate of
'Umar (&) in judicial, organisational, financial and administrative
matters; how 'Umar (&) appointed 'Ali
to be in charge of
Madinah on several occasions, how be consulted with him regarding
matters of jihad and affairs of the state; the strong and warm
relationship between 'Umar and Ah1 al-Bayt; the marriage of 'Umar
to Umm Kulthoom, the daughter of 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&); and the
background of this blessed marriage. I list clear evidence that refutes
the false reports and demolishes them utterly. The historical facts
show us a picture that highlights the real love that existed among the
noble companions, as described in the Holy Qur'an.

(4)

I explain the allegiance that 'Ali (&) swore to 'Uthmh (&)
when he assumed the caliphate, and I refute the lies that have
surrounded the incident. I speak of 'Ali's efforts in support of
'Uthmin's state, how he defended 'Uthmh (&) against the
troublemakers, his attitude towards the unrest that led to the siege and
murder of 'Uthmiin (&), and his stance after this martyrdom. I write
of the intermdage between the family of 'Ali (4)
and the family
of 'Uthmk (&).

I quote the comments of 'Ali (&) concerning the Rightly
Guided Caliphs who came before him, which are indicative of the
love and respect he had for them, and his disavowal of those who
slandered and reviled them. He carried out the hadd5 punishment for
slander on those who reviled Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may AUah be
pleased with them both). The Muslim reader cannot help hut weep
when he or she reflects upon the words of Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali
(&) concerning the caliphs and his interactions with that unique
Qur'anic generation and its noble leaders.
I recount the swearing of allegiance to 'Ali (&) as caliph and
how it was done; why he was most entitled to it; the consensus of the
Companions concerning it; how Tabah and az-Zuhayr swore
allegiance to him voluntarily, without any pressure or compulsion;
how consensus was formed about his caliphate; the conditions
stipulated by 'Ali (&) in his oath of allegiance; the first sermons he
gave; the decision-makers in his state; a little about his virtues and
most important attributes and the foundations of his system of rule. I
discuss at length his attributes, describing his vast knowledge, deep
understanding, asceticism, humility, generosity, noble attitude,
modesty, devotion and gratitude to Allah (B),patience, sincerity
and humble supplication; the ultimate reference point for his state
and how it adhered to the Book of Allah and the Snnnah of His
Messenger (g)
and followed the example of the Rightly Guided

'Ali ibn Abi T8lib

29

Caliphs who preceded him; the right of the Ummah to keep watch
over its rulers; consultation, justice, equality and freedom; his life in
society and his concern to enjoin what is good and forbid wbat is evil;
his promotion of tawheed6 and his fight against polytheism; his
teaching the people about the names and attributes of Allah ( B )and
the blessings of Allah (B),
for which He deserves to be thanked; his
keenness to erase all traces of pre-Islamic ignorance; his keenness to
prove the falsity of belief in the stars; his punishment of those who
exaggerated about him and claimed that he was divine; his speech
about how faith begins in the heart; his definition of taqwa7; his
concept of the divine will and decree and how Allah (&)brings His
slaves to account despite their large numbers.
I also cite some of his speeches and exhortations, as well as the
poetry that is attributed to him or that he quoted on different
occasions. I have chosen a number of his valuable, wise sayings that
have become like proverbs among the people. I discuss wbat he said
about the attributes of the best of people and about obeying the
Prophet (g);
how be described the noble Companions and how he
warned against serious diseases that affect the he& (spiritual
maladies), such as expecting to live a long life, following whims and
desires, showing off and self-admiration. I also relate his concern for
bringing discipline in the markets and for fighting against
innovations and actions among people that are contraty to Sharia.
I discuss the institutions of his state, such as financial
institutions, the judiciary and the governor system, and how the
institutions of judiciary and legislation worked at the time of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs; the sources to which the Companions
referred at that time; the distinguishing features of the judiciary
system at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs; the most famous
judges appointed by 'Mi (&); his judicial style; his view of the
rulings issued before him; those who were qualified to serve as

30

introduction

judges; passing judgement for kee; his ijiihiZs concerning acts of
worship; financial interactions, hadd punishments, just retaliation
and criminal cases. I refer to the importance of using as evidence the
views of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and other Companions.

In my discussion, I explain the institution of governors and the
provinces of the state at his time, and the important events that
happened in each region. I discuss his method for appointing
governors and keeping watch over his workers, some of his
guidelines and the extent of authority granted to his governors, such
as appointing advisers to each governor in each province, the
formation of consultative committees, the establishment of annies in
each province, the drawing up of foreign policy in war and peace, the
maintenance of internal security, the setting up of a judicial system in
each province, financial expenditure, the workers belonging to each
province and checking on them, and the role of the chiefs and leaders
in maintaining law and order. I explain some administrativeconcepts
based on the sayings of Amir al-Mu'mineen ' M (&), such as his
emphasis on human dignity, the importance of experience and
knowledge, the relationship between the leader and those under his
authority, fighting stagnation, inspection and evaluation, control,
joint decision-making, good choices on the part of the governor,
offering fmancial and psychological security to state employees,
keeping men of experience around the governor, a benevolent
paternalistic approach to administration, and the criteria for
employment, which should be based on qualifications and not on
personal connections.
Then I move on to a discussion of the internal problems at the
time of 'Ali (&).
.. I begin with the Battle of the Camel, starting with
the events that preceded it and the effect of the Saba'i organisation on
the outbreak of the battle; the role of Abdullah ibn Saha' in stirring up
internal turmoil; the difference of opinion among the Companions

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

31

concerning the way to punish the murderers of 'Uthmin (&id); and
the attitude of 'kishah, Mother of the Believers (%),~a&ah,azZubayr, MuZ2wiyahibn Abi SufySm and those,who were with them,
who favoured hastening to punish the murderers of 'UthmSm (&I.
also describe the attitude of those who were neutral and did not get
involved in the conflict, such as Sa'd ihn Abi Waqqi~,Abdullah ibn
'Umar, M&arnmad ibn Maslamah, Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, 'Imrib
ibn Husayn, U s h a h ibn Zayd and others who adopted their
approach. I discuss the view of those who wanted to delay carrying
out any pu~shInentuntil things had settled down, such as Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&); the attempts at reconciliation before the Battle
of the Camel broke out; the outbreak of fighting and the first and
second rounds thereof; the martyrdom of Talhah and az-Zubayr; how
the people of Basra swore allegiance to 'Ali(&); the attitude of 'Ali
(&) towards the Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah (&) and how he
interacted with her, showed respect towards her and sent her back to
Madinah honourably.
I refer to the virtues of 'kishah (I!&) and give a little of her
biography. I also give biographies of az-z"bayr and Ta&ah, because
they were among the most influential personalities of the era of the
Prophet ($&) and the Rightly Guided Caliphs, including the time of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&). I defend them on the basis of tmth,
because they have been wronged; I describe their virtue and their
status in Islam, and I refute the misleading arguments and lies that
have become attached to them. I affum the clear facts and
indisputable evidence about their refined characteristics and noble
attitudes, so that the Muslim reader will come away with real
knowledge of these brilliant figures, without any trace of confusion
or ambiguity, so that he or she will not be influenced by the weak
reports or fabricated stories, made up by RZfidi Shia historians,
which have distorted the image of these characters in the minds of
some people. The approach I followed in discussing the biographies

32

Introduction

of 'kishah, Tabah, az-Zubayr, and other senior Companions who
left their mark during the time of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), is in
accordance with the method of Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jamci'ah (Sunni
Muslims), in general and in details.

I also discuss the Battle of Siffeen; Mu'iwiyah's motives in
not swearing allegiance; the correspondence between him and 'Ali
(may AUah be pleased with them both); attempts at reconciliation;
the outbreak of fighting; the calI for arbitration; the slaying of
'Ammi%ibu Y2sir (&) and its impact on the Muslims; the good
conduct of both sides during the war and confrontation; the treatment
of prisoners of war; the number of people slain; how 'Ali (&)
prayed for mercy for the slain on both sides; and his ban on reviling
Mn'Zwiyah and cursing the people of Syria. I then discuss the
arbitration, and I provide short biographies of Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari
and 'Amr ihn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with them both). I
demonstrate the falseness of the baseless lies and fabricated stories
that have been attributed to them with regard to the arbitration, and I
outline what we can learn from this story about resolving disputes
between Muslim countries. 1focus on the attitude of Ah1 as-Sunnah
with regard to these wars, and I warn against some books which
distort the history of the Companions wrongfully, such as al-Imcimah
was-Siycisah, a book which is falsely attributed to Ibn Qutaybah; alAgh&ni by a l - I s f a h ~ ,Tareekh al-Ya'qoobi; Tareekh al-Mas'oodi
and other books which deviate from the methodology of Ah1 asSunnah wal-Jami'ah and the academic trust. I explain the role of the
Orientalists in distorting Islamic history, and how they made use of
the books of the R2fidi Shia to do so; how they established an
opposing school of thought which contributed to the contamination
of ideas, distortion of events, concealing of the facts, and
exaggeration of the dark spots in our bistoly under bright slogans
such as unbiased academic research, realistic approach, objectivity
and neutrality. These destructive ideas were adopted by a number of

'Ali ibn Abi T&lib

33

Muslims who belong to Islam but who do not understand it, present it
well, follow its teachings or defend it effectively; instead, they fell
into the traps of the enemies of Islam, who are working to distort the
history of this Ummah and the civilisation that was created by this
great religion.
In the last chapter, I undertake an objective, academic study on
the Kharijites and RZfidi Shia. I describe the origin of the Kharijites
and who they are, and I quote prophetic hadiths which mention
criticism of them. I also discuss their withdrawing to Haroora', Ibn
'Abbb's debate with them, 'Ali's policy in dealing with them, the
reasons why he fought them, the outbreak of fighting with them, the
story of Dhul-Thadyah or al-Mukhaddaj, and the effect of his slaying
on the m y of 'Ali (&).

I present the rulings of Islamic jurisprudence that Amir d Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
. . came up with in the Battle of the Camel, the
battle of Siffeen and his battles with the Kharijites, and how the
Muslim jurists subsequently relied on these rnlings and compiled
them in their books, under the heading of rulings of the interpretation
of Islamic law of dealing with rebels. I also point out the most
important characteristics of the Kharijites at the time of 'Ali (&),
such as religious extremism, ignorance of religion, rebelling against
authority, regarding the blood and wealth of the Muslims as
permissible, slander, misguiding, thinking badly of others and being
cruel and harsh towards the Muslims. I discuss some of the beliefs
and opinions of the Kharijites, such as regarding as a disbeliever
anyone who commits a major sin, their view of the position of caliph,
their slander against some of the Companions and their regarding
'Uthmk and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) as disbelievers. I
briefly discuss the causes of the Kharijite deviation from the truth and
their ideas in modem times, such as: ignorance of Islamic sciences as
a result of turning away from the scholars and reading books without

teachers, going to extremes in condemning those who imitate or
follow scholars, the neglect of their duties on the part of many
scholars, the spread of injustice and refening to man-made laws for
judgement, the spread of conuption among people and their failure to
purify their souls. I point to the most significant aspects of their
exaggeration, such as going to extremes and making issues of
religion hard on themselves and others, pretending to have great
howledge, self-admiration, clinging to their own opinions and
regarding others as ignorant, criticising and maligning the dedicated
scholars, having harsh and violent altitudes towards others and
regarding some Muslims as disbelievers.

I speak of the R2fidi Shia sect and explain the meaning of the
words 'Shia' and 'ar-rafd (the root of the word R2fidi) both in
linguistic terms and in Sharia terminology, and thk reason for their
being called R Z G s ; how they originated and the role of the Jews in
that; the stages through which the Shia passed; the most important
beliefs of the RZ& Shia; the attitude of 'Ali (&) and the scholars of
Ah1 al-Bayt concerning those beliefs that are attributed to them, such
as the belief in imamate and the ruling on the one who denies that.
They claim that the Qur'an has stated the concept of imamate in the
verse of purification (33:33), the verse of mubiihalah (3: 61) and the
verse of wilriyah (5: 55). Their so-called evidence from the Sunnah
includes the sermons of Ghadeer Khum and the hadith, "You are to
me like Haroon was to Moosa." I also discuss the weak and
fabricated hadiths that they quote as evidence for the concept of the
imamate, such as the hadith of the bird, the hadith of the house, and
the hadith "I am the city of howledge, and 'Ali is its door." I discuss
at length the evidence that they offer for the concept of infallibility,
and I explain why it is false.
I include in the book an index of the weak and fabricated
hadiths that the RZ& Shia quote as evidence, so as to warn the

'Ali ibn Abi T&lib

35

Muslims against falling into their traps. I explain the meaning of
tawheed according to the R%& Shia, how they distorted the texts of
tawheed to make them correspond to their belief in the Imams and
made imamate the basis for acceptance of deeds; their belief that the
Imams are intermediaries between AUah (&) and His creation; their
idea that people cannot be guided except by the Imams and
supplication cannot be accepted except in the name of the Imams; the
fact that they consider pilgrimage to Shia shrines better than
pilgrimage to the House of Allah, their idea that the Imam can forbid
or permit whatever he wants, and that this world and the hereafter are
for the Imam to dispose of however he wants; their attribution of
natural events to the Imams; their saying that the Imams have the
knowledge of what has happened and what will happen, and that
nothing is hidden from them; their exaggeration about the concept of
affirmation and how they deny the divine attributes; the issue of the
creation of the Qur'an and the issue of seeing Allah (&) in the
hereafter; their belief that the Imams are superior to the prophets and
messengers; their attitude towards the noble Qur'an and the belief of
some of their scholars that the Book of AUah has been distorted, with
a refutation of that; the attitude of the Rafidi Shia towards the noble
Companions and the Sunnah of the Prophet; their concept of taqiyyah
(dissimulation or deception); their belief in the awaited M a w , their
belief in bringing certain individuals back to life and their belief in
changes in the divine will and decree. I explain the attitude of Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&), the imams of Ah1 al-Bayt and
the Snnni scholars towards these conupt beliefs that deviate from the
Book of Allah. In my discussion, I strive to adhere to proper etiquette
and to avoid reviling and insults. I discuss Shia ideology on the basis
of their sources and the books on which they rely. I am keen to show
the truth to those who love AN al-Bayt among the Shia; I invite them
to follow the example of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), and I warn
them against those who hide beneath the cloak of Ah1 d-Bayt with

36

Introduction

the aim of corrnpting people's beliefs and keeping them away from
the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (@J.
Moreover, I have written this hook with a sincere desire to
educate the Sunni masses about the reality of the RsifidiShia, because
Shia ideology is present and influential among the peoples of Africa,
Asia, Europe, and North and South America. The proponents of the
RZfidiShia point of view are active in spreading their deviant call and
are spending a lot of wealth for that purpose. They have allied
themselves with the enemies of true Islam so as to strike it, distort it
and put an end to it. This is not a new phenomenon, hut the Sunnis with few exceptions -are completely oblivious to their tactics; they
seem to be in a deep slumber, unaware of what is being planned
against them. Some of them say that the SunniIShia conflict belongs
in the past, but this is not trne; it indicates ignorance and shows that
the Muslim masses have been deceived in the name of bringing the
two sides together and uniting the Muslims.
The correct way to grow close together is for the Sunni
scholars to make a greater effort to spread the sound beliefs that are
derived from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of
Allah (g),
to explain the soundness of those beliefs and to
demonstrate how they are distinct from the views of the followers of
innovation. Ahl as-Sunnah wal-JamZ'ah are the ones who are
following the way of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and his
Companions, and their name is derived from their adherence to the
Sunnah of the Prophet
which is encouraged in his words, "I urge
you to adhere to my ~ u n n a hand the way of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs who come after me; cling to it and adhere firmly to it."" He
warned us not to go against it when he said: "Beware of newly
invented matters, because every newly invented matter is an
innovation, and every innovation is a going astray,"" and,
"Whoever turns away from my Sunnah has nothing to do with me."

a),

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

37

This is different from the others, the people of whims and desires and
innovation who followed ways other than that of the Messenger (g).

The beliefs of Ah1 as-Sunnah originated with the emergence of
the Prophet's mission, and they are preserved by Allah (&) in His
Book and in the Snnnah of the Messenger (SJ.On the other hand,
some of the beliefs of the followers of whims and desires emerged
after the time of the Prophet (g);
some emerged at the end of the era
of the Companions, and others emerged later than that. The
Messenger &)~., foretold that whoever of his companions lived long
enough would see division and dissent. He said: "Whoever among
you lives (long enough) will see a lot of differences."12 Then he told
them to follow the straight path, which means following his Sunnah
and the way of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and he wamed against
newly invented matters, saying that they are misguided. It is not
rational to suggest that some p a t of truth and guidance could he
hidden from the Companions (may Allah he pleased with them) and
saved for people who would come after them. All of those newly
invented innovations are evil; if there had been any good in them, the
Companions would have initiated them. Many of those who came
after them indulged in these innovations and deviated from the way
of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Imam Maik
(may Allah have mercy on him) said: "The last of this Ummah will
never be sound except on the basis of that which made the first of this
Ummah sound." Hence Ah1 as-Sunnah are named after the Sunnah,
while others are named after false and deviant groups or after
particular people.
The best way to bring people together is to explain the truth
and expose the falsehood and to hring the Shia closer to the Book of
Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (@), with the understanding
of true Islam according to the Sunni scholars, primarily the jurists and
scholars of Ahl al-Bayt, such as Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) and

38

introduction

his sons and grandsons. We should also pay attention to and
encourage sincere Shia voices of reform. We should respect them,
appreciate them and support them in their attempts to correct the
course of their people, as as-Sayyid Husayn al-Moosawi has said in
his valuable book, Lillrihi thumma lit-Tareekh: Kashf al-Asrrir wa
Tabri'ah al-A'immah al-Athlir 13, and as represented in the academic
effort undertaken by as-Sayyid m a d al-Kitib in his book
Tatawwur al-Fikr as-Siycisi ash-Shi'i min ashShoora ila WiEyat alFaqeeh. We have to show support to every sincere lover of Ah1 alBayt who follows the sound reports related from them and their way
of guiding people to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His
Prophet @).We should treat them with all due respect and hold their
hands until they reach the safe shore. We should encourage them to
use reason, liberate their minds from their bonds and remove the
heavy accumnlation of falsehood that has overwhelmed their
common sense, so that they will have the opportunity to reach the
truth, which shines brightly and cannot be hidden by the dark clouds.
The scholars of Ah1 as-Sunnah must adhere to the methods of
calm academic research when discussing innovation and innovators,
and they should be kind and gentle with them. Part of that kindness
may entail visiting them and helping them in matters in which there is
no dispute, or supporting them at times of calamity and hardship, or
when they are in a dispute with disbelievers or those who are
wronging them, in accordance with a proper understanding of Islamic
politics and on the basis of the pros and cons. But this principle of
cooperation, good relationship and quiet academic debate is not
always appropriate. In the case of those Rififidi Shia who engage in
extreme actions, when keeping quiet may have an impact on the
uneducated masses, we must denounce the extremists with regard to
their odd opinions. What are the guidelines for differentiating
between the two - the first group, with whom we should speak

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

39

gently, as opposed to the second group, with whom we should deal
harshly? If the person's opinion is based on a Sharia text but the
misinterpretation of it leads to his or her confusion, or the person's
opinion is based on arguments that are erroneous but that may make
sense to some people, then we should kindly explain to them. As for
those who base their views on strange reports that were hansmitted
by unknown or later narrators, and those whose ideas are not a result
of simple misinterpretation, being harsh in denouncing their
innovations is a must.
The Sunni scholars and the decision-makers among them in
sectarian societies have a major role to play in leading the Muslims
towards goodness. They are also the ones who-areable to evaluate the
political situation and make alliances or deals with other groups and
sects on the basis of a proper understanding of the pros and cons, in
accordance with Sharia political principles. This does not mean that
the scholars and caJlers should give up teaching the Muslims the
basic principles of Ah1 as-Sunnah and educating them in accordance
with those principles, calling the people to them and waming them
against the &en, compt beliefs that are being propagated among the
Muslims. This is necessary so that the Muslims will not be influenced
by these false beliefs whose proponents are striving to spread them
night and day, in secret and in the open, without ever getting tired.
We have a good example in the Messenger of Allah @); when he
migrated to Madinah, he signed treaties and covenants with the Jews
that guaranteed them a life of dignity in the shade of the Islamic state.
At the same time, the Holy Qur'an spoke of the beliefs, the history
and the morals of the Jews so that the Muslims would come to know
the reality of the Jewish character and would not he misled by it.
When the Jews committed their act of treachery, the Muslims were
not deceived because they already had knowledge of their character.

The one who studies Islamic history, such as the Crusades at
the time of ora ad in'^ and saladin15, the Ottoman era at the time of
Sultan Muhammad al-F2tih and others, and the ~lrnoravids'~
at the
time of Yoosuf ibn Tashfeen, will notice that the factors leading to
revival and victory are many, including: purity of belief and clarity of
method; ruling the state in accordance with the laws of Allah; the
presence of a dedicated leadership that follows the guidance of Allah,
acts according to the natural laws of Allah with regard to educating
and leading the nations and the rise and fall of states, and is also
aware of social problems, how nations develop, the secrets of history,
and the plots of the enemies, be they Crusaders, Jews, atheists,
esoteric sects or innovators, and gives each factor its proper weight
when dealing with them. Issues having to do with revival, short and
long term, are complex and interwoven. They can only be understood
by those who understand the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the
Messenger (@) and are well versed in the positions of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs, which have been preserved from our great
predecessors. They know the features and characteristics of revival,
the means of bringing it about and the causes of its disappearance,
and they learn from Islamic history and experiences of revival. Thus
they realise that this Ummah never lost its leading position when it
was sincere to its Lord and its Prophet, and they understand that
military defeat is temporary, the effects of which soon diminish, but
that intellectual defeat is a deadly wound. They h o w that sound
education builds the Muslim individual, the Muslim family, the
Muslim society and the Muslim state. This education must be built on
solid foundations that are based on the Book of A l l a , the Sunnah of
His Messenger (g)
and the guidance of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
and those who followed in their footsteps. The genius of the early
generation in building the Islamic civilisation is that which, after the
help and protection of All&, preserved for Islam its strncture until
today.

We have to strive for this religion. Our happiness will come
not from haste and quick results, but from sensing the help of Allah
(g)
and hoping to attain His pleasure.

In my study of the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, I have
been careful in selecting words and phrases in order to fully clarify
this period through sound reports, so that Muslims may learn from
this era and acquire abundant knowledge and deep understanding,
thus comprehending Islam in its totality. May Allah bless this effort
and make it of benefit to those callers whose names we do not know,
but whose impact will be seen over time, those who will help the
Muslim world to overcome all obstacles and rise above its
shortcomings, those devoted and sincere souls who know the truth
and are happy to support it, who strive for it, defend it and stand by it,
despite their weakness and lack of helpers. Allah (&) bas guided
them because of their sincerity and devotion and their following the
Prophet (s).
~.
, May He make this book beneficial to those scholars and
seekers of knowledge, the ink of whose pens is equal to the blood of
the martyrs; and to those businessmen who stand behind da'wah"
efforts, supporting them with their wealth and their selves, implicitly
saying: 4We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you. Verily, We
fear from our Lord a Day, hard and distressful, that will make the
faces look horrible [from extreme dislike to it].) (Qur'an 76: 9-10)
They are the unknown soldiers of this world, who will nevertheless
be prominent figures in paradise.
Powerful storms are raging, seeking to uproot our Islam, our
religion and our beliefs; the efforts of the enemies of Islam, the
Crusaders, Jews, secularists, esoteric sects and innovators are
targeting our leaders and prominent figures in the fields of science,
literature and politics, seeking to destroy our history, because if a
nation is without history, it will never be a sound nation. What is the
value of a nation that has no heroes? What is the value of a religion

42

Introduction

that does not produce heroes despite its lengthy history (as they
claim)? Can we learn lessons from our history that will humiliate the
enemies of Allah and tum their plots against them? What can help us
to resume our mission and support our civilisation?
Humanity is currently going through hard times in this dark
era of history because it has strayed far from the path of Allah. The
remedy lies with the Muslims alone. Will they be fair to themselves
and save the others? Will there he a return to Islam in such a way that
our hearts are purified, we establish good, we become connected with
the Qnr'an and we fully sense the honour of belonging to the nation
and religion of Muhammad (g)?
Will we be motivated to conduct
our lives in accordance with his call and the way of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmin and 'Ali, and all the
noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them)? Will we be
able to form another link in the chain of support for the message of
the Beloved (g),
which will continue until the end of time?
Before mentioning the sources and references that I used, it is
essential to acknowledge that were it not for the help of Allah (B),
and then the efforts of the scholars of Ah1 as-Sunnah and the seekers
of knowledge who followed in their footsteps, I could not have
pursued this venture in such depth. Hence I acknowledge that I have
benefited from academic theses which have been typed but not
published, in terms of their content, methodology,judging of reports,
referring to modem, historical and other sources, while also
attempting to build on and benefit from the efforts of others.
In particular, I would like to mention Dr. Akram Diya' al'Umari, who supervised and discussed many of the theses in this
field. I have benefited from his books, such as his sound biography of
the Prophet (g)
and his study of the era of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs. I have also benefited from the theses that he supervised,
such as that by Dr. Yahya al-Yahya, titled al-KhilZfah ar-Rcshidah

44

introduction

their good deeds on the Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will
avail, except for the one who brings to Allah (&) a clean heart [clean
from shirk (polytheism) and (hypocrisy)].'8
With regard to the sources used for this study that have to do
with the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, they are as follows:

1)Books of Hadith
I started with the six books: Saheeh al-Bukhari, Saheeh
Muslim, Sunan Abi Driwood, Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Sunan an-Nasri'i
and Sunan Ibn Mcijah; then the Muwatca' of M%k and the Musnad of
A m d , then I made some effort to extract the historical material that
has to do with the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. I referred to the
historical material in Musannaf 'Abdur-Razzciq, Musannaf Ibn Abi
Shaybah, Mustadrak al-Hrikim, as-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi,
the Sunan of Sa'eed ibn Mansoor, the Musnadal-Humaydi, Musnad
at-Tayrilisi, Majma' az-Zawci'id, Kashf as-Sattrir 'an Zawri'id alBaurir and Mawririd adh-Dham'cin ila Zawci'id Zbn Hibbcin. I did
not overlook al-Mu'jam al-Kabeer by at-Tabarki or the Sunan of
ad-Dikaqutni. I benefited from the efforts of the commentators on the
hooks of hadith mentioned above when judging the reports.

2) Commentaries on Hadith
The most important of the commentaries on hadith are Fath alB i n by Ibn Hajar and Sharh an-Nawawi 'ala Saheeh Muslim, in
which there is historical material that cannot be overlooked. The
comments of Ibn Hajar and an-Nawawi on some significant historical
events are also important.

3) Books of Tafseer (Qufanic commentary)
The most important of these are by at-Tabari, a l - Q m b i and
Ibn Katheer. I paid more attention to their comments than to the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

45

reports that they transmitted, since most of the reports are mentioned
in the books of hadith and history.

4) Books of ' ~ ~ e e d a h ' ~
The most important of these hooks are Minhcij as-Sunnah anNabawiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah, from which I benefited a great deal,
Sharh at-Tahhiiwiyyah, al-Ibcinahji Ujool ad-Diycimh, al-I'tiqcid by
al-Bayhaqi, ash-Sharee 'ah by al-A,and other books of 'aqeedah,
from which I quoted the opinions of the early generation conceming
the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the status of the Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them all).

5) Books of Islamic jurisprudence
The most important books that I consulted are: al-Mughni by
Ibn Q u d h a h , al-Majmoo' by an-Nawawi, Bidciyat al-Mujtahid by
Ibn Rushd and some others. I benefited from them with regard to
interpretation of Islamic law and judicial issues in which the Rightly
Guided Caliphs reached their conclusions on the basis of their ijtihsd.

6) Literary works
I have taken from these literary works some poetry that is
attributed to the Rightly Guided Caliphs or that they quoted or
listened to. Since literaq works do not mention chains of narration,
and they contain both good and had material, I chose verses of poetry
that are in harmony with the Book of Allah (B),
the Sunnah of His
Messenger (@) and the morals and attitude of that unique generation.
Among the most important of these books are: 'Uyoon al-AWlbcir by
Ibn Qutaybah and al-Adab al-Zslamiji 'Ahd an-Nubuwwah by Niyif
Ma'roof.

46

Introduction

7) Books of Asceticism and softening of hearts
From these I have quoted sayings of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs in this field. Among the most important of these books are:
'Uddat as-Sibireen wa Dhakheerat ash-Shcikireen by Ibn alQayyim; Madirij as-Srilikeen by Ibn d-Qayyirn; Mukhtafar Minhij
al-Qrisideen by &mad ibn ' A b d u r - R b i n d-Maqdisi, and others.

8) Books on Sects and madh-habs
(Schools of juristic thought)
The most important of these books are: al-Faqlfil-Milal walAhwa' wan-Nikl by Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm adh-Dh&ri and
Usool Madh-hub ash-Shi'ah al-Imamiyyah al-Ithm 'Ashariyyah by
Dr. N2sir at-Qafc.

12) Books of history
The most important of these is Tareekh at-Tabari. This book
contains reports whose chains of narration are sound, weak and
fabricated. The reports regarding 'aqeedah, Sharia rulings and events
having to do with the Companions must be subjected to thorough
evaluation, and the ones by Riitifidi Shia, liars and unknown narrators
should be highlighted. In this regard, I have benefited from the books
lstishhcid 'Uthmcin wa Waq'at al-Jamalfi Mawiycit Sayf ibn 'Umar
fi Tareekh at-Tabari by KhiXd al-Gbayth, Marwzycit Abi Makhnufji
Tareekh at-Tabari by Dr. Y&ya Ibrriheem al-Y&ya and Athar atTashayyu' 'ala ar-Rzwciycit at-TCEreekhiyyah by Dr. 'Abdul-'Azeez
Noor Wali. One of the most important of these books is al-Bidciyah
wan-Nih&ah by Ibu Katheer.
These are the most important sources to which I referred, along
with a large number of various modem references
I was very strict in verifying reports or passing judgement on
them when they had to do with matters of belief, rulings and the
Companions (may AUah be pleased with them). In this regard, I only
transmitted the words of scholars who are specialised in this field, so
thanks is due fist to Allah ($g)and then to these scholars. I sought to
depict historical events on the basis of sound repoas, but I did not
neglect the weak reports altogether; I made use of the latter to
complete the picture when it could not be completed by the sound
and reliable reports, in a manner that is in harmony with the spirit of
that age, but only with regard to issues that have nothing to do with
'aqeedah or Sharia. I also engaged in a discussion of the erroneous
arguments and lies of the Rzdis, the Orientalists and some
contemporary writers. I was keen to demonstrate the methodology of
Ah1 as-Sunnah concerning the period of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
and to refute the specious arguments, especially with regard to the
time of 'Uthmib and 'Ali (may AUah be pleased with them). Many

new ideas have been presented by some of our dear brothers in the
study of the period of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and I have the
strong intention, if Allah (g)
wills, to develop these ideas further in
a manner that is in harmony with that brilliant age. We ask Allah (&)
to guide and help us.

I have singled out the fifth of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, alHasan ibn 'Ali ihn Ahi T2ib (&), for a special study because of the
importance of his views, which reflect a deep understanding of how
to run the state in accordance with Sharia and according to a deep
understanding of pros and cons; his unique vision for reforming and
uniting the Ummah by giving up the caliphate to Mu'iwiyah (&);
and the obstacles and calamities he faced while striving to implement
his vision. He had a remarkable ability to lead his pioneering venture
of reconciliation and a resolve to c m y it out, which led to the unity of
the Ummah and the fulfilment of the prophecy of the Prophet (g):
"This son of mine is a leader, and perhaps Allah will reconcile two
groups of the Muslims through
With al-Hasan's giving up
the caliphate and swearing allegiance to Mu'iwiyah (may Allah he
pleased with them both), the period of caliphate in the footsteps of the
Prophet came to an end after thirty years. The evidence for that is to
be found in the words of the Messenger of Allah (B):
"Caliphate in
the footsteps of the prophets will be for thirty years, then Allah will
give sovereignty to whomever He will,"21 and "Caliphate in my
Ummah will be for thirty years, then it will be kingship after that.""
Ibn Katheer commented on this hadith, saying: "The thirty years
were completed with the caliphate of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, as he gave up
the caliphate to Mut2wiyah in Rabee' al-Awwal 41 AH, thus
completing exactly thirty years from the death of the Messenger of
Allah (B),
as he died in Rabee' al-Awwal ll AH. This is one of the
signs of his prophethood (@)."23 Thus al-Hasan ibn 'Ali(&) was
the fifth Rightly Guided Caliph.

'Ali ibn Abi Talib

49

Inshallah my book al-Hasan ibn 'Aliwill provide an important
conclusion to the study of the period of the Rightly Guided Caliphs.
It will encompass the unique features and characteristics of that era,
the reasons for its demise, its system of rules and the qualities of its
people and leaders, its constitution and crisis management at that
time, as well as a study of the laws and causes of advancement, the
status of women at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, the
institutions of the state and the deep understanding of what it meant
that they knew that they were going to meet Allah (&).

I was also very keen to analyse the character of Amir atMu'mineen 'Ali (&) from various angles, as his life is a great page
in the history of the Ummah. He is one of the leaders whose guidance
people can follow in their words and deeds in this life. His biography
is one of the strongest sources of faith, sound Islamic inspiration and
proper understanding of this religion. From him we learn the true
understanding of the law of cause and effect, and how to behave and
plan in accordance with it; how we may live with the Holy Qur'an,
following its guidance and the example of the Messenger of Allah
(g);
the importance of fearing Allah (&), being sincere to Him and
seeking that which is with Him in order to attain success in this world
and the hereafter; the impact of all of these on the life and revival of
the Muslim Ummah and the resumption of its role in building a
leading civilisation. Hence in my study of the life and times of 'Ali
bin Abi T2ih (&), I dedicated myself to the task and put all my
effort into it, without claiming to he infallible and without denying
any of my mistakes, seeking nothing but the countenance of Allah
(g)
and His reward, for He is the one whose help I seek, His are the
best of names, and He hears all supplications.
I completed this book on Saturday at 12:45 p.m. on 17 Rahee'
al-Awwal1424 AW 7 June 2003 CE. AU thanks he to AUah (%)first
and last. I ask Him by His most beautiful names and sublime

50

attributes to make my work sincerely for His sake and beneficial to
His slaves, to reward every letter that I have written and put it in the
balance of my good deeds, and to reward my brothers who helped me
with everything they could to complete this humble effort. We hope
that every Muslim who reads this book will not forget its author, who
is in need of the pardon, forgiveness, mercy and good pleasure of his
Lord, in his or her supplications. (My Lord! Grant me the power and
ability that I may be grateful for Your favours which You have
bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do righteous good
deeds that will please You, and admit me, by Your Mercy, among
Your righteous slaves.) (Qur'an 27: 19)
Allah (&) says: (Whatever of mercy [i.e. of good], Allah may
grant to mankind, none can withhold it; and whatever He may
withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the Almighty, the
AU-Wise.) (Qur'an 35: 2)
May AUah send blessings and peace upon Sayyiduna
Muhammad (g)
and his family and Companions. Glory and praise
be to You, 0 Allah. I bear witness that there is no god except You, I
seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You. And the end of our
supplications is: all praise be to AUah, the Lord of the Worlds.
The one who is in need of the pardon, forgiveness, mercy and
good pleasure of his Lord,

CHAPTER ONE
'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&) in Makkah

1. Names, Lineage, Attributes and Family
1.1.Names and titles
1.1.1.Name and lineage
%e
full name and lineage of 'Ali (&) was 'Ali ibn Abi
T%b ('Abd Man%) ibn 'Abdul-Mudib, who was called Shaybah
al-qamd2 ibn Hhhim ibn 'Abd Manif ibn Qnvayy ibn Kilib ibn
Lu'ayy ibn Gb2lib ibn Fihr ibn M i l k ibn an-Nab ibn Kinkah ibn
Khuzaymah ibn Madrakah ibn nyis ibn Mudar ibn Nizir ibn Ma'd
ibn 'Adn211.~ He was the paternal cousin of the Messenger of Allah
(B)and s h a d a grandfather with him in 'Abdul-Muytalib ibn
Hkhim. His father was Abu T%b, the full brother of Abdullah, the
father of the Prophet (g).
'Ali's name at birth was Asad, he was
given this name by his mother (%),who named him after her father
Asad ibn Hkhim. This is referred to in the lines of verse that 'Ali
composed on the day of Khaybar, when be said: "I am the one whose
mother named him ~ a ~ d a r alike
h ~ a, lion of the jungle, frightful to
beh~ld."~

'

Abu Tilib was not present when 'Ali was born. When he
returned, he did not like this name, and be called the child ' ~ l i . ~

52

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

The kunyab of 'Ali (&) was Abu al-Hasan, after his oldest
son al-Hasan, who was one of the children of his wife Fztimah (&&,),
the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (g).
He was also knowdby
the kunyab Abu Turib, which was given to him by the Prophet
and he was always happy to be addressed by it. The story behind that
name was that once when the Messenger (&) came to the house of
Fgtimah, and he did not find 'Ali in the house, be asked her: "Where
is the son of your uncle?' She said: "Tbere was a disagreement
between him and me, and we got angry with one another, so he went
out and did not take a nap here with me." The Prophet (gJ
said to
someone: "Go and see where he is." The man came and said: "0
Messenger of Allah, he is sleeping in the mosque." The Messenger
of Allah (g)
went and saw h i n lying there. His upper garment had
fallen from his shoulder, and dust (turrib)had gotten on to him,so the
Messenger of Allah (g)
began wiping it from him and saying, "Get
up, Abu Tm5b (father of dust)."' According to a report narrated by
Bukhari: By Allah, no one called him that except the Prophet (+z).~

(s),

Other kunyahs of his were: Abu al-Hasan wal-Husayn, Abu alQ k i m al-~Lhimi'' and Abu a s - ~ i b @ ~ n . l '

1.1.3. Titles
Amir al-Mu'mineen (Commander of the Faithful), the fourth
of the Rightly Guided

1.2. The birth of 'Ali (&)
There are many different reports about the year of his birth. AlHasan d-Bqri stated that be was born fifteen or sixteen years before
the Prophet's mission began.13 Ibn Ishiq stated that he was born ten
years before the mission began,14 and Ibn Hajar regarded this view as

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

53

more likely to be ~ o r r e c t . 'Al-B@ir
~
Mulpmrnad ibn 'Ali mentioned
two views: the first is the same as that mentioned by Ibn Ishiq and
regarded as more likely to be correct by Ibn Hajar, which is that he
was born ten years before the mission began.16 The second view is
that he was born five years before the mission began.I7 I am inclined
to favour the view of Ibn Hajar and Ibn Ishiq, so his birth was most
likely to have occurred ten years before the mission began.'' Al172kihi19stated that 'Ali (&) was the first of Banu Hishim to be born
inside the Ka'bah. Al-H&m said: The reports that 'Ali was born
inside the Ka'bah are mutawiitir (reported by so many people that it
would not be possible for them to have agreed on an untruth).20

1.3. Lineage and family, and. their impact
on the offspring
According to the science of anatomy (the study of the body's
structure), psychology, bebavioural science and sociology, blood ties
and lineage affect a person's attitude, talent and potential to some
extent, in most cases. That bas to do with three things:
(a) Individuals try to maintain the values and ideals that their fathers
and forefathers strongly believed in and adhered to, and they regard
themselves as being of noble descent because of them. They consider
themselves highly respectable and regard as odd those members of
the family who go against these beliefs and drifi away. Such an
att~tudeis considered to be unacceptable and a sign of low esteem,
lack of dignity, disobedience to the forefathers and tarnishing of the
lineage that cannot be forgiven according to the inherited standards
of that family.
(b) Each family has stories of forefathers and prominent members
and their courage, chivalry, gallantry, sense of honour, generosity,
munificence, and defence of the oppressed and weak. These are

54

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib in Makkah

transmitted from one generation to another and boasted about from
an early age, through the age of youth to maturity. This affects the
mental and emotional disposition of an individual and defines the
standards of greatness and manhood. This respect for parents and
forefathers offers justification for the good name of the family and
the lineage.
(c) The science of genealogy proves that these attributes are inherited
from generation to generation in a family that maintains its lineage.2'
This is not absolute; neither is it a rnle with no exceptions, unlike the
divine laws of which Allah (s)
says: bSo no change will yon find in
Allah's Sunnah (way of dealing), and no turning off will you find in
Allah's Sunnah (way of dealing).b (Qur'an 35: 43) The Prophet (g)
also referred to this meaning when he said: "People are of different
qualities like gold and silver; the best of them in the jcihiliyyah 22 will
be the best of them in Islam, if they ~nderstand,"'~and "Whoever is
slowed down by his deeds, his lineage will not help him to get
ahead."x
That
is not to say that inherited blood is to be sanctified, or that
/'
spiritual or academic leadership is concentrated in a particular family,
or that any family has a permanent monopoly on the leadership of the
Ummah in religious, spiritual or academic terms. In the ancient world
before Islam, this was a problem that caused overwhelming social
and moral corruption, tyranny and abhorrent financial exploitation;
this was evident through the downfall of the Roman and Sassanid
empires, ancient Greek and Indianz5societies and other cultures that
were based on jailiyyah. The history books chronicle their collapse,
and the historians bear witness to it. Hence it is appropriate for us to
point out the position of the family and lineage into which 'Ali was
born and in which he was raised, in racial and social terms. It is also
imperative to bring forth the characteristics, customs, traditions and
psychological and moral legacy that distinguished his family, and

/

'Ali ibn Abi Thlib

how the Arabs viewed it and affirmed its virtue. We will start with
Quraysh and move on to Banu ~ 2 s h i m . ~ ~

1.3.1. The tribe of Quraysh
All the Arabs acknowledged the sublime and noble lineage of
Quraysh, their leadership, the purity of their language, their fluency
and eloquence, their noble attitude, courage and chivalry. That
became like a byword, indisputable and i~refutable?~
They were
united allies who still adhered to a great deal of the law of Ibrsheem
al-Khaleel [the Prophet Abraham ( 'alayhi as-salGm -peace be upon
him)]. They were not like the Bedouin, who had no respect for
religion and no good manners. They loved their children, went on
pilgrimage to the Ka'bah, performed the rituals (of hajj), shrouded
their dead, washed in the case of impurity resulting from sexual
activity, regarded as msguided the guardians of the fire temples28,
and kept away from incest with daughters, granddaughters, sisters
and nieces out of decency and a wish to shun the way of the Magians.
The Noble Qw'an was revealed approving of their behaviour and
good choices in that regard. They married with a dowry and
witnesses and gave three-stage div0rces.2~What increased them in
honour was the fact that they married from any tribe they wanted
without stipulating any conditions, but they would not give their
daughters in marriage to anyone until they had stipulated that he
should be a strict follower of their religion. They thought that because
of their high status, it was not permissible for them to give their
daughters in marriage until the other party submitted to them and
followed their way.30

1.3.2. Banu Hsshim
Banu H2shim was the most prominent clan of Quraysh. If we
read what historians and the biographies of the Prophet Muhammad

56

'Aliibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

(@) have recorded about their exploits and sayings - which is very

little indeed - we will see that they were distinguished by all noble
human feelings, moderation in all things, sound reasoning, strong
belief in the high status of the Ka'bah before Allah (g),
avoidance of
wrongdoing or rejecting the truth, high ambition, kindness towards
guests and the oppressed, generosity, courage and everything that
chivalry implied to the Arabs of noble meanings, praiseworthy
characteristics and good conduct that befits the forefathers of the
noble Prophet (g).
Banu Hhbim did not attain this status in their
society except by means of sacrifice, generous living and service to
the people. All that they practiced was in conformity with what the
Prophet (g)
~,
propagated about noble morals and manners, with one
exception: since they lived during the period between the coming of
two prophets, they went along with their people with regard to
ignorant beliefs and acts of worship.31

'Abdul-MutJalib ibn Hiishim was the grandfather of the
Prophet (g)
and of 'Ali ibn Abi T s h (&). 'Abdul-Mugalib ibn
HL& was in charge of providing water and food32 to all of the
pilgrims after his uncle al-Muttalib died. For his own people, he did
what his forefathers before him had done with regard to managing
their affairs, and he reached a high status among his people that none
of his forefathers had reached. His people loved him, and be became
very prominent among them.33
'Abdul-Muplib was not the richest man among Quraysh, nor
was he the sole master of Makkah, as Qusayy was, because in
Makkah there were men who had more wealth and power than he
had. He was the most prominent figure among his people because he
was in charge of providing water and food for the pilgrims and he
was in charge of the well of ~ a r n z a r n which

had a
strong faith that this House was of high esteem before All& (&) and
that He would protect it and take care of it. The sublime character and
strong, proud attitude of this leader of Quraysh were manifested in
the conversation that took place between him and Abrahah, the King
of Abyssinia. Abrahah wanted to invade Makkah and humiliate the
Ka'hah, thus putting an end to its high position, and he had captured
two hundred camels belonging to 'Abdul-Muttalib. When 'AbdulMumlib went to see him, Abrahah showed great respect by making
room for him on his throne and allowing 'Ahdul-Muwb sit with
him. Then he asked what he wanted, and 'Abdul-Muwb replied:
"What I want is for the king to return the two hundred camels of mine
that he has captured." When he said that, the king lost interest in him
and turned his face away, and he said: "Are you speaking to me about
two hundred camels of yours that I have captured, and ignoring the
House that is the basis of your religion and the religion of your
forefathers, which I have come to destroy, and you are not speaking
to me about it?!" 'Abdnl-MntJalih said: "I am the lord (owner) of the
camels, but the House has a Lord Who will protect it." Abrahah sai&
"No one can protect (the Ka'bah) from me." 'Abdul-Muttalib said:
"It's up to
What 'Abdul-Munalib said turned out to he true;
the Lord of the House protected His house and made Abrahah's plot
go astray:
(And He sent against them birds, in flocks, Striking them with stones
of Sijjeel [baked clay]. And He made them like [an empty field ofl
stalks [of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle].)
(Qur'an 105: 3-5)
'Ahdul-Munalib taught his children to avoid wrongdoing and
oppression. He urged them to have a good attitude and forbade them
from indulging in vile and base matter^.^' When 'Abdnl- MutBlih
died, he was past the age of eighty, and the Messenger was eight

58

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in MaMah

years old, which means that he died in approximately 578 CE.~'It
was said that no market was held in MaMcah for many days after the
death of ' ~ b d n l - ~ u t r ; l l i b . ~ ~

1.3.4. Abu T5lib
Abu TSb was the father of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&). Abn Tilib
had no wealth. He loved his nephew very much, and when he went
out he took him along. Abu Tiilih looked after the Messenger of
Allah (&) after his grandfather's death, so the Prophet grew up with
him under his
When the Messenger of AUah (@) proclaimed
openly, Abu T Z b stood beside him and was
the call to Allah
determined to support him and not let him down. That upset Quraysh
a great deal and caused them to feel distress and envy, and they began
plotting. One is astounded and impressed by the chivalrous attitude
of Ahu m h towards the Messenger of Allah (@). Abu T%h
connected his fate to that of his nephew Muhammad (@); indeed he
made use of the fact that he was the leader of Banu Hhhim to bring
Banu Hkhim and Banu Mugalib together in support of him,
swearing to live or die together in defence of the Messenger of Allah
(@), Muslims and polytheists alike.41 He offered complete
protection to his nephew Muhammad @) without hesitating or
declining. When Abu Tiilib saw the good efforts that his people were
making for his sake and their sympathy for him, he began praising
them, refening to their noble history and the position and status of the
Messenger of AUah (g)
among them, so as to reinforce their attitude
and bring them closer to him.4z He said:

(s)

I f one day Quraysh gathered together to boast,
'Abd Manif would be their heart and soul;
And if the nobles of 'Abd Manif were reckoned,
Among Hishim would be their noblest and chief;
I f they boast one day, then Muhammad

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

59

Would be the chosen noble and honourable one.
Quraysh summoned everyone against us;
They were not successful and they were beside themselves.
Of old we have never tolerated injustice;
Whenpeople turned away their faces in pride we made themface us.
When Abu T a b feared that the Arab masses would join forces
with Quraysh against his people, he spoke words of poetry in which
he sought refuge in the sanctity of Makkah and its status, offering the
hand of friendship to the nobles of his people, yet at the same time
telling them in his poetry that he would not hand over the Messenger
of AUah (g)
nor would he leave him for anything, even if he died
defending him. He said:

When I saw the people had no love for us
And had severed every time and relationship,
And shown us enmity and ill-will,
Obeying the orders of persecuting enemies,
And had allied themselves with heacherous people against us,
Biting their fingers in rage at our backs,
I stood firm against them with my pliant spear,
And my shining sword, heirloom of princes.
Round the temple I gathered my clan and my brothers,
And laid hold of the striped red cloth that covered it,
Standing together, facing its gates,
Where everyone who takes an oath completes his vow.
He sought refuge in the Ka'bah and the sacred things in it, and
he swore by the Ka'bah that he would never hand over Muhammad
(B)even if blood flowed in rivers and battles with different clans of
Quraysh intensified:

You lie, by God's House, Muhammad shall not be maltreated;
Before we shoot and thrust in his defence,

60

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib in Makkah

We will not give him up until we lie dead around him,
And be unmindful of our wives and children;
Until a people in anns rise and fight you,
As camels carrying water rise under empty water-skins.

Abu T2ib continued to support his nephew and managed to
penetrate the society of Quraysh with his great poetry that moved the
people deeply. When Islam became deeply entrenched in the hearts
of the members of some tribes, Quraysh came together and agreed
among themselves to carry out a boycott against Banu HLhim and
Banu Mugalih, according to which they would not intermany with
them or trade with them, either buying or selling. They wrote a
document, hung it up inside the Ka'bah and took pledges to that
effect. Banu Hishim and Bann Muttalib went to Abu T2ib and
stayed with him in his mountain pass.43This occurred in the month of
M$arram, seven years after the p~ophethoodbegan, and Banu
Hkhim remained in this situation for nearly three years, during
which nothing reached them except in secret. Finally, the worms ate
the document, and the Prophet (@Jtold Abu Taib about it, and about
the tearing up of the document and the cancellation of its contents.44
Abu T%b died in the middle of the month of Shaww2, in the tenth
year of prophethood, when he was over eighty years old, but he had
not become ~ u s l i mThis
. ~ ~was the same year in which Khadeejah
(%),the wife of the Prophet (@J,also died, and calamities befell the
Messenger of Allah (B)one after another. The year was known as
the Year of h or row.^^

1.3.5. The mother of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)
'Ali's mother was the noble female Companion Fitimah hint
Asad ibn Hhhim ibn 'Abd Manif ibn Qusayy a l - ~ h h i m i ~ ~ a h . ~ '
She was the first HLhimi woman to give birth to a Hishimi son.48

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

61

She took care of the Prophet (g)
when his paternal uncle Abu T%b
sponsored him on the recommendation of his own father 'AbdulMugalib. She was like a mother to him after his own mother died; she
looked after him and took care of him as best she could. The Beloved
(@) spent two decades of his life in her care, and she answered the
call of Islam and became one of the first Muslim women, one of the
elite women who occupied a high position in the realm of virtue. She
(I&) was kindness and compassion personified. This is exemplified
in-theway she interacted with F i m a h az-Zahra' (I&,) and helped her
out of sheer kindness towards her and her father (&I. It was narrated
from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) that he said: I said to my mother:
Take care of bringing water and other errands for Fitimah, and she
will take care of grinding flour and making dough for you.49Her high
position in relation to the Prophet (g)
is further enhanced by the fact
that she memorised and narrated a number of hadiths from the
Prophet
She was held in high esteem by the Messenger of Allah
(B),and he gave her gifts. Ibn Hajar narrated in al-Z~?ibahthat 'Ali
said: A suit of brocade was given to the Messenger of Allah (B),and
he said: "No, rather make them into veils and give them to the

Fitimah (the mother of 'Ali) was fortunate and blessed in her
life and when she died. She was honoured to die within the lifetime of
the Beloved (@).52 With regard to the report that was narrated from
Anas about her burial, it is very weak and is not strengthened by the
other reports, because they are all weak. It was narrated that Anas ihn
M%k (&) said: When F2cimah bint Asad
the mother of 'Ali,
died, the Messenger of Allah
entered upon her and sat at her
head and said: "May Allah have mercy on you, 0 my mother, for you
were a mother to me after my mother died; you went hungty so that

(s)

(a),

62

Xli ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

you might give me enough, you stayed without proper clothing so
that yon might clothe me, yon refrained from eating good food so that
you might feed me, seeking thereby the countenance of Allah (g)
and the home of the hereafter." He ordered that every part of her he
washed three times, and when he reached the water in which there is
camphor, the Messenger of AUah ( g ) poured it with his own hand,
then the Messenger of Allah (g)
took off his garment, and she was
clothed in it, and she was wrapped with his cloak over that. Then the
Messenger of Allah (@J called U s h a h ibn Zayd, Abu Ayyoob alAn&, 'Umar ibn d - K h a ~ and
b a black slave to dig, and they dug
her grave, and when they reached the niche, the Messenger of Allah
( g ) dug it with his own hand and removed its soil with his own hand.
When it was finished, the Messenger of Allah (@) entered it and lay
down in it and said: "0 Allah, Who gives life and death, and Who is
living and will never die, forgive my mother F2timah hint Asad, help
her to answer the angels' questions, make her grave spacious by
virtue of Your Prophet and the prophets who came before me,
because You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy." And
he said takbeerS3 over her four times (that is, offered the funeral
prayer for her), and he and d-'Abbk and Abu Bakr (may Allah be
pleased with them) placed her in the niche.54
This hadith was quoted as evidence by somes5 to show that it
is permissible to seek to draw closer to Allah by mentioning the
virtue of righteous people. Professor Abu 'Abdur-R@in Jablin ibn
Kha& al-'Amosi, in his Master's thesis, researched the chains of
narration of this hadith and demonstrated that it is either weak or
falses6, and he explained that the hadith was narrated via five chains,
three of which are maws001 and two are mursal, but none of them
was free of many problems, so it is extremely weak. Nevertheless,
seeking the help of Allah (&) by virtue of someone else is only
mentioned with one chain, which is via Anas (&). Other hadiths
may weaken this hadith because all of them are weak, so they weaken

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

63

one another and only increase it in weakness. With regard to the text,
it is to be rejected for several reasons:
- In this hadith, there is exaggeration and excessive praise, going

beyond what was the norm at the time of the Prophet
-This

(a).

hadith is contrary to the teachings and Sumah of the Prophet

(g)
with regard to washing the body of a woman on several
counts, including the following: His pouring the water himself,
which is mentioned only in this story. With regard to the
reports about the washing of his daughter Zaynab, he told
others to wash her and he did not pour the water himself.
Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Muhammad ibn Sireen that
Umm 'Atiyyah said: The Prophet (B)entered upon us when
we were washing his daughter and said: "Wash her three
times, or five, or more than that, if yon see fit, with water and
lotus leaves, and put camphor in the last time. And when you
have finished, let me know," When we had finished, we let
him know, and he gave us his waist wrapper and said: "Put it
next to her body." And he did not do any more than that.57
- Digging with his own hand and taking out the dirt with his own

hand and lying down in the grave are only narrated in this
weak hadith, which is contrary to his normal way, and it is a
kind of exaggeration and excessive praise.
Moreover, the wording of the supplication,which begins in the
third person and then moves to the second person, is very
different from his usual style in the supplications which are
narrated in hadith ("0Allah, You..."). We do not see in any
supplication apart from this one the words "0 AUah, Who..."
- Another indication of its weahness is that the narrator admits that

the Prophet (B)did not do these actions except on this
occasion, but he wants to highlight this fact as a justifi~ation.~~

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib in Makkah

1.3.6. The siblings of 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&)
Abu T a b had four sons: Tiilib, from whom he took his
kunyah (Abu Tzlib), 'Aqeel, Ja'far and 'Ali. He also had two
daughters, Umm Hzn? and Jumhah. All of them were children of
F&uah hint Asad. There were ten years between each of them; T2lib
was the oldest, then 'Aqeel was ten years younger, then Ja'far, who
was ten years older than ' ~ l iThe
. ~following
~
is a brief look at the
siblings of 'Ali:
(a) Tiilib ibn Abi Taib: T a b died a polytheist after the Battle of
Badr. It was said that he left and did not return, and no one knew
where he ended up or what happened to him; he was one of those
who got lost in the earth. He loved the Messenger of Allah (gJ
and
wrote poetry praising him. He joined the polytheists at Badr
reluctantly. A dialogue took place between him and Quraysh when
they went out to Badr. They said: By Allah, 0 Banu Hbhim, we
know that even if you go out with us, your inclination is in favour of
Muhammad. TZb went back to MaMcah with those who went back,
and he composed poetry and an ode praising the Prophet (g)
and
enlogised the disbelievers who were thrown into the well at ~ a c l r . ~ '
(b) 'Aqeel ihn Abi T a b : he was known by the kunyah Abu Yazeed.
He did not become Muslim until the year of the conquest of Makkah,
it was said that it was after Hudaybiyah. He migrated to Madinah at
the beginning of 8 AT3. He was taken captive on the day of the battle
of Badr and was ransomed by his paternal uncle d-'Abbzs. He is
mentioned in several places in a$-Saheeh.He was martyred during
the campaign of Mn'tab, and no mention of him is made with regard
to the conquest of Makkah and the Baffle of Hunayn, because he was
sick. That was mentioned by Ibn Sa'd, but az-Znbayr ibn Bakkk
stated, with his chain of nmation going back to dHasan ibn 'Ali,
that 'Aqeel stood firm (in battle) on the day of Hunayn and died

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

during the caliphate of Mu'iwiyah. In Tareekh al-Bukhari al-A~ghar
it is mentioned with a sound chain that he died at the beginning of
Yazeed's caliphate, before the battle of al-~arrah~',
at the age of
ninety-six!'
(c) Ja'far ibn Ahi T%b: Ja'far was one of the earliest Muslims. He
loved the poor and sat in their company, S e ~ e them
d
and conversed
with them. He migrated to Abyssinia, where the Negus and those
who followed him became Muslim at his hands. I have discussed him
in my book as-Seerah an-Nabawiyyah: 'Arad Waqi'i' wa Tahleel
Ahdrith (The Prophet's Biography: Events and Analysis). He was
maayred fighting bravely at Mu'tah in greater ~ ~ r i a . 6 ~
(d) Umm H W bint Abi Tsib: The female paternal cousin of the
Prophet ( a ) . It was said that her name was F m t a h or Fiemah or
Hind, but the frst is better known. She was the wife of Hnbayrah ibn
' A m ibn ' k i d h al-Makhzoomi, and she bore him 'Am, from whom
he took his kunyah. At the conquest of Makkah, Umm Hi%' granted
protection to two men from Banu Makhzoom, and the Messenger of
Allah (g)
said: "Those to whom you grant protection, we grant
protection, 0 Umm Hhi'." Umm H h i ' narrated hadiths from the
Prophet ( g ) which are recorded in the six books and elsewhere as

(e) Jumhah bint Abi T a b : She is also known as Umm Abdullah ibn
Abi Sufyin ibn al-H2rith ibn 'Abdul-Munalib. She was mentioned
by Ibn Sa'd iu his biography of her mother Ficimah bint Asad, in his
chapter on the female paternal cousins of the Prophet (@I.
She bore
Abu S u f y k ibn al-Hikith his son Ja'far ibn Abi Sufyh, and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
gave her thirty wasqs of dates from

Jumkah and Nafeesah. M&y% bint Imrul-Qays bore him a daughter
who died young. Ibn Sa'd said: There is no sound proof that he had
any other children apart from these.72In total, the number of children
that 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&) had was fourteen sons and nineteen
daughters. (Some said seventeen daughters.) His descendants came

1.3.8. Physical characteristics of 'Ali (&)
Ibn 'Abdul-Ban (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The
best description that I have seen of 'Ali (&) is that he was of average
height, if not on the short side, with wide black eyes, a handsome face

like the moon when it is full, a large belly, broad shoulders, large
hands and a neck like silver brocade. He was bald, with no hair on his
head except at the back; his beard was large and thick. The bones of
his shoulders were like the hones of a strong lion, and there was no
difference between his forearm and upper arm,as if they were one. If
he held a man's arm,the man would not he able to breathe. Even
though he was somewhat fat, his arm and hand were very powerfnl.
When he walked in battle he almost ran, and he looked steadfast,
strong and brave.74

2. His coming to Islam and his most
important exploits in Makkah
before the Hijrah
2.1. Accepting Islam
One of the blessings that AUah (fg)
bestowed upon 'Ali ibn
Abi Taib (&), and what Allah willed for him of good, was that a
severe crisis befell Quraysh. Ahu T a b had many children, and the
Messenger of Allah (@) said to his paternal uncle al-'Ahhis -who
was one of the most well off of Banu Quraysh - "0 'AbbL, your
brother Ahu Tilib has many children, and you see what has happened
to the people in this crisis. Let us go and reduce the number of his
dependants; I will take one from his family and you will take one, and
we will take care of them for him." Al-'Abbis agreed, so they went
to Abu Taib and said to him:"We want to reduce the number of your
dependants until this crisis has passed." He said to them: "If yon
leave me 'Aqeel, then do whatever you want." So the Messenger of
Allah (@) took 'Alihome, and al-'Abbis took Ja'far (&). 'Ali ibn
Abi ~ a i (&)
b
stayed with the Messenger of Allah (g)
until his

68

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in M a k h

(4)

prophethood, then 'Ali
followed him and believed in him.
Ja'far (&) stayed with al-'Abb2s until he became Muslim and no
longer needed his help?5
We may note that the Messenger of Allah (@) wanted to pay
back the kindness of his uncle Abu Tilib, who had sponsored him
after the death of his grandfather 'Abdul-MuMib. This was one of
the greatest blessings that Allah
bestowed upon 'Ali (&), as he
was raised and educated by the one who was guided by ~ i a h
The one whose attitude was the Qur'an looked after him and took
care of him. This Qur'anic attitude was reflected in 'Ali (&), and it
was enough that he was raised by the Prophet
He grew up in the
house of Islam and leamed its teachings at an early stage in his life,
before the call of Islam went beyond the walls of the house to seek
followers who would support it and propagate it among other people,
bringing them forth from darhess to light. The scholars differed as to
the next person who believed in Islam after Khadeejah hint
Khuwaylid (%),the Mother of the Believers, who was the first of all
the people. 6 s the next person Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq or 'Mi (may
Allah he pleased with them both)? The scholarly view, which I am
inclined to favour, is that the first one to become Muslim among free
men was Ahu Bakr, the first child to do so was 'Ali, the first woman
to do so was Khadeejah, and the first slave to believe was Zayd ibn
Hzthah (may Allah he pleased with them
Thus Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&)
was
the
first
child
to
become
Muslim.

2.2. How did 'Ali become Muslim?
Ibn Ish2q narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi T3ib (&) came to the
Prophet (g)
after Khadeejah (I&,) became Muslim, and he found
them paying. 'Ali (&) said: '%%at is this, 0 Muhammad?" The
Prophet (g)
said: "The religion of Allah, which He has chosen for
Himself, with which He sent His Messengers; I call you to Allah

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

69

alone and to worship Him, and to disbelieve in al-Lat and al' ~ z z a ~ 'Ali
~ . "said to him: This is something that I have never heard
of before today; I will not decide anything until I speak to Ahu T%h.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
did not want to disclose his secret
before he announced it openly, so he said to him: "0 'Ali, if you do
not become Muslim, then keep quiet about it." He remained like that
for a night, then Allah (s)
caused his heart to incline towards Islam,
so in the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah (g)
and said:
What did you offer to me, 0 Muhammad? The Messenger of Allah
(B)said: "That you should hear witness that there is no god except
Allah 1%) alone, with no partner or associate, and disbelieve in alLat and 'Uzza, and disavow yourself of the rivals (to Allah)." 'Ali
(&) did that and became Muslim, and he kept coming to him (the
Prophet) fearing that Ahu T2lih would find out. He concealed his
Islam and did not show it openly.78

2.3. Between 'Ali (&) and Abu TSlib
Ibn IshQ said: Some scholars have stated that when the time
for prayer came, the Messenger of Allah (B)would go out to a
mountain pass of Makkah, and 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib would accompany
him, concealing the matter from his father Ahu T%h, all his uncles
and all the people. They would offer the prayers there and come hack
in the evening. This continued for as long as Allah (s)
willed, until
Ahu T2ih came upon them one day while they were praying, and he
said to the Messenger of Allah (g):
"0 son of my brother, what is
this religion that you are following?" He replied: "0uncle, this is the
religion of Allah, the religion of His angels, the religion of His
Messengers and the religion of our father Ibr2heem. He has sent me
as a Messenger to the people and you, 0 uncle, are the most
deserving of my sincere advice and my call to guidance; you are the
most deserving to respond and help me with that." Ahu T 3 h said:

70

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib in MaWrah

"0 son of my brother, I cannot leave the religion of my forefathers
and the way they followed, but no harm will reach you so long as I

am alive." They said that he said to 'Ali: "0 my son, what is this
religion that you are followmg?" He said: "0 my father, I believe in
Allah and the Messenger of Allah, and 1believe what he has brought.
I prayed with him to Allah, and I followed him." And they said that
Abu Taib s a d to 'Ali: "He is calling you to something good, so
follow hlm.,,79

2.4. Did 'Ali (&) break .the idols with the
Messenger of Allah (&) in Makkah?
It was narrated that 'Ali (&) said: The Prophet (@J and I set
out and went to the Ka'bah. The Messenger of Allah (.@) said: "Sit
down," and he climbed on my shoulders and I wanted to stand up
with him on my shoulders, but he realixed that I was weak, so he got
down. The Prophet of Allah
sat down and said: "Climb on my
shoulders." I climbed on his shoulders, and he stood up with me on
his shoulders, and I felt that I could reach the farthest horizon in the
sky. I climbed up on top of the House, where there was a statue of
gold or copper. I started shakmg it right and left, forwards and
backwards, until I was in full control of it. The Messenger of Allah
(&) said to me: "Throw it down." So I threw it down and it broke
like a glass bottle, then I came down, and the Messenger of AUah (s)
-and I rushed away until we hid among the houses, lest anyone find
us. 80 The chain of narration of this hadith is weak, and we cannot
base any ruling on it as some people claim. The basic principle dnnng
the M&an period remains that the Prophet
did not allow the
Companions to use force with their opponents or commit any act of
aggression against their idols and statues. The Messenger of Allah
(@) purified Makkah of idols at the time of the conquest, and sent
expeditions after that great conquest to destroy idols and purify the

(s)

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

71

Arabian Peninsula of the sites of polytheism and false gods, after he
became able to remove them and destroy them.

2.5. Did 'Ali (&) bury Abu Tiilib
on the Prophetis instructions?
It was narrated from 'Ali (&) that he came to the Prophet (g)
and said: "Ahu T2ih has died." The Prophet (B)said: "Go and bury
him," and 'Ali (&)
.. said: "He died a polytheist." The Prophet (@)
said: "Go and bury him." When he had buried him, he went hack to
the Prophet (SJ,and he said to him: "Do ghusl 81.n82 According to
another report, he said: "Go and do ghusl, then do not do anything
until you come to me." 'Ali said: "So I did ghusl, then I came to him,
and he offered supplication for me that made me happier than getting
red and black camels." The narrator, 'Ahdur-Rz&mib as-Sulami,
said: When 'Ali had washed a deceased person, he would do g h ~ s 1 . ~ ~

2.6. Ali's attention to security matters and
his role in bringing Abu Dharr (&)
to the Messenger of Allah (B)
Among the main features of Islam during the Makkan stage
were concealment and secrecy, even from the closest of people. The
Prophet's instructions on the necessity of secrecy were very clear and
strict. 'Ali (&) played an important role in bringing Abu Dharr to
the house of
Messenger (B).
Ahu Dharr (&) was unhappy with
the situation of jiildiyyah, he refused to worship idols and
disapproved of those who associated others with Allah (B).
He used
to pray to Allah for three years before he became Muslim, without
choosing any specific direction of prayer. It seems that he was
following the path of the Haneefs. When he heard of the Prophet
(g),
he came to Makkah, hut he did not want to ask about him until

the

72

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib in Makkah

night came, then he lay down and 'Ali (&) saw him and realised that
he was a stranger, so he invited him to stay with him. He did not ask
him about anything. In the moming, he went to al-Masjid al&r6mX4, and he stayed there until evening came. 'Ali saw him and
invited him to stay for a second night. The same thing happened on
the third night, then 'Ali asked him why he had come. When Ahu
Dharr was certain about him, he told him that he wanted to meet the
Messenger (gJ. 'Ali told him that he was indeed the Messenger of
Allah ( g ) and said: "In the morning, follow me. If I see anything that
I fear for you, I will step aside as if 1want to pass water, but if I cany
on then follow me." He followed 'Ali and met the Messenger (@J,
Listened to what he had to say and became Muslim.
The Prophet (@) said to him: "Go back to your people and tell
them to wait until my instructions come to you." He said: By the one
in whose hand is my soul, I shall shout at the top of my voice among
them. He went out to the mosque, and he shouted at the top of his
voice: I hear witness that there is no god except Allah and that
Muhammad is the Messenger of AUah. The people leapt up and
attacked him, throwing him to the floor. Al-'Ahhh ibn 'AhdulM u m i b came and warned them of the vengeance of his tribe Ghifik,
who might intercept the trade caravans of Quraysh, which passed
through their land on the way to Syria. Thus he saved him from
them.85 Before coming to MaMcah, Abu Dharr (&) had sent his
brother to find out about the Prophet (g), to listen to what he had to
say and then come to him. His brother did so, then he came back to
Ahu Dharr (&) and told him: I have seen him enjoining good
attitudes and saying words that are not poetry. He said: You have not
given me what I wanted, and he resolved to go himself to the
Messenger of Allah (g)
His
. brother said to him: Be on your guard
against the people of ~ a k k a hfor
, they are his enemies and are hostile
towards him."

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

73

The lessons we learn from this incident are the following:

2.6.1. Not rushing to seek information
Abu Dharr (&) realised that Quraysh resented everyone who
spoke to the Messenger
This caution was safer and was dictated
by the sensitivity of the situation. If Abu Dharr had asked openly
about the Prophet (g),
-, Quraysh would have found out what he
intended to do, and thus he would have been exposed to harm and
expulsion and would not have been able to achieve the purpose for
which he had left his people and undergone the hardships of travel.

(s).

2.6.2. Caution when giving information
When 'Ali (&) asked Abu Dharr (&) why he had come to
Makkah, he did not tell him as an extra precaution, even though Ali
(&) hosted him for three nights. Before telling him, he stipulated
that he should conceal his secret at the same time as he showed him
the way. This extreme caution brought him what he wanted.

2.6.3. Security cover for their movements
'Ali and Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with them both)
agreed upon a gesture or certain movement, giving the impression of
fixing his shoe or passing water, if 'Ali (&) saw someone watching
them. This security cover for their movements towards the
headquarters (Dar al-Arqam) was in addition to the fact that Abu
Dharr was walking some distance behind 'Ali. This attitude was
regarded as a precaution, taking into account all possibilities that
could arise while they were moving.

74

'Ali ibn Abi TrElib in Makkah

2.6.4. The Companions' advanced approach
to security matters and the importance
of security in their minds
This attitude was deeply entrenched in their hearts to such an
extent that it was a distinguishing characteristic of all their actions,
both private and public. Their movements were careful and well
thought out. How great is ow need to develop a similar sense of
security to that of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).
Security has become very important in our own time with regard to
the demise and survival of states and civilisations, and it is very
relevant to the weakness or strength of nations, peoples, groups,
institutions and organisations. It has become a specialised field of
knowledge with advanced techniques and highly developed methods
and styles, its own independent organisations and high-level budgets.
Information in general, and security information in particular, is sold
for the highest price, and souls may be sacrificed in order to obtain it.
As long as this is the case, then the Muslims must pay attention to the
security aspect so that our secrets wiU not be discovered by our
enemies or fall into their hands.87

2.7. 'Ali (&) was with the Messenger of Allah
(g)
when he went around to the tribes and
presented the call to Islam to them, and he
attended the negotiations with Banu Shaybsn
It was narrated from A b h ibn Taghlib from 'Ikrimah from Ibn
'Abbiis: 'Ali ibn Abi T a b told me: When Allah (&) commanded
His Messenger (g)
to present himself to the Arab tribes, he went out,
and Abu Bakr and I went with him, to Mina, where we joined one of
the gatherings of the Arabs. Abu Bakr went forward and greeted
them, and he was known for his prominence in doing good and his

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

75

howledge of Arab lineages... Then we went to another gathering,
which was a gathering of dignified and respectable people. Abu Bakr
went forward and greeted them, and he said: "Who are you?' They
said: "Banu Shaybk ibn Tha'labah." Abu Balcr turned to the
Messenger of Allah (&) and said: "May my father and mother be
sacrificed for you. These are the best of the people, and among them
is Mafrooq, who is the most eloquent and handsome among them."
He had two braids falling down his chest, and he was sitting closest to
Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr said: "How many are you?" Mafrooq said: 'We
are more than one thousand and will never be defeated because of
lack of numbers." Abu Bakr said: "How powerful are you?'
Mafrooq said: "We are at our most angry when we meet (our enemies
in battle), and we are most likely to engage them when we are angry.
We love horses more than children and weapons more than women.
Victory comes from Allah; He grants victory to us sometimes, and
He grants victory against us sometimes. Perhaps you are the man
from Quraysh [the Messenger of Allah]?' Abn Bakr said: "If you
have heard that he is the Messenger of Allah, here he is." Mafrooq
said: "0 man of Quraysb, what are you calling us to?"
The Messenger of AUah (#&) said: "I am calling you to bear
witness that there is no god except Allah alone with no partner or
associate, and that I am the slave of Allah and His Messenger, and to
give me refuge and support me, for Quraysh have rebelled against
Allah and disbelieved in His Messenger. They have preferred
falsehood to trnth, but Allah is Independent of Means, Most
Praiseworthy." Mafrooq said: "What else are you calling for, 0 man
of Quraysh? For by Allah, I have never heard any words more
beaufiful than this." The Messenger of Allah (g)
recited:
6 a y [O Muhammad]: Come, I will recite what your Lord has
prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good
and dutifnl to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty

76

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah
I

-We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to AlFawihish [shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse] whether
committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has
forbidden, except for a just cause [according to Islamic law]. This He
has commanded you that you may understand.) (Qur'an 6: 151)
Mahooq said: "By AUah, you are calling to the noblest of
attitudes and the best of deeds, and the people who disbelieve in you
and oppose you are wrongdoers." Then he referred the matter to
H k i ' ihn Qnbaysah, saying: '%is is HZni' our chief, who is in
charge of our religions affairs." H W said: "I have heard what you
said, 0 man of Quraysh, and I think that giving up our religion and
following yours the fust time we meet you is not a good idea and is a
sign of not thinking through the consequences. Haste leads to
mistakes, and we do not want to make a deal on behalf of those whom
we left behind. But we will go hack and you will go back, and we will
think about it." Then it was as if he wanted al-Muthanna ibn Hsrithah
to contribute to the discussion, and he said: "Al-Muthanna here is our
chief and is in charge of our military affairs." Al-Muthanna - who
became Muslim later on - said: "I have heard what you have to say,
0 man of Quraysh, and my answer is the same as that of Hgni' ibn
Quhaysah with regard to our giving up our religion and following
yours. We are located between two sources of water, one of which is
al-Yarnkiah and the other is al-Samzmah." The Messenger of Allah
(g)
said: "What are these two sources of water?" He said: "Rivers of
chosroes8' and water of the Arabs. As for the rivers of Chosroes, if
we offend him, then he will not forgive us or accept any excuse; we
are allowed to camp there on the basis of a promise that we gave to
Chosroes not to do any wrong and not to give refuge to any
wrongdoer. I think that this matter to which you are calling us, 0 man
of Quraysh, is something that kings dislike, but if you want us to give
you refuge and to support you in the areas near the Arab waters, we

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

77

will do that." The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Your answer is not
bad, because you have spoken sincerely. No one can support the
religion of Allah (&)except the one who will support it in all ways.
Why don't you wait a while, and soon you will see how Allah (&)
will give you inheritance of their land and yon will take their women
as slaves? Why don't you glorify and sanctify Allah
AnNu'mik ihn Shareek said: "Then we grant you that."89

(s)?"

This hadith contains lessons that 'ALi ibn Ahi Tilib (&)
. .,
learned from this incident, including the following:

1.

'Ali (&) learned that the Prophet (g)
refused to give any
guarantee of power to any individual by way of reward for their
support for the call of Islam. That is because the call of Islam is
in fact a call to Allah ($1, and the basic condition with regard to
the one who believes in it and is prepared to support it is that it
should be sincerely for Allah (&) alone, and seeking His
pleasure should he the utmost aim that the person is trying to
achieve by means of his support and sacrifice, not the hope for
power or the desire for authority. That is because the motive for
a person's action is what will have an impact on the way he tries
to go about it, so it is essential that the aim behind supporting the
call should he free from any material interest, in order to
guarantee continuous support for it, to protect it from any
deviation and to guarantee the maximum support for it and
sacrifices for its sake.90So everyone who wants to adhere to the
main body of Muslims that calls people to Allah (&) should not
stipulate any condition that he should be given a position or any
kind of worldly gain, because this call is to Allah (&)alone. The
matter is in the hands of Allah (&), and He decides things as He
wills. The one who wants to join the effort should seek thereby
the countenance of Allah (%) and strive to raise His banner. But
if position and status are what is motivating him, this is a serious

78

I

'Ali ibn Abi p l i b in Makkah

I

sign which indicates that there was something wrong with his
intenti~n.~'
Hence Y&ya ibn Mu'idh a-R&i said: He will
never prosper from whom you sense any sign of aspiration to
leadership positions.92

2. 'Ali (&) learned from the Messenger of Allah (s)
that the type
of supGort that the he was seeking from the tribal leaders for his
call should not he connected to any international treaties that
conflicted with the call and from which they could not free
themselves. In that situation, their support for the call might
expose it to danger of destruction by the state with which they
had the tseaty, and this would pose a threat to the Islamic call and
its interests.93Conditional or partial support does not achieve the
desired aim. Banu Shaybiu would never have fought against
Chosroes if he had wanted to capture the Messenger of Allah
(g)
and his followers. Thus the negotiations failed.94
3.

The religion of Allah (&) will never be supported except by one
who is prepared to support it in all ways. This was the response
of the Prophet (g)to al-Muthanna ibn Hcthah when he
suggested to the prophet (g)that he could offer hi~nprotection
at the Arab water but not-at the Persian water. Whoever has
lengthy experience of politics will recognise the unequalled
farsightedness of the Prophet (g).95

4.

'Ali
saw the impact of Islam on al-Muthanna and his
people after they became Muslim, and how Banu Shayhsn took
upon themselves the burden of standing up to the Persians. AlMuthanna ibn Hcthah - later on was one of the leaders of
the conquest of Iraq at the time of Ahu Bakr (&). Their faith in
this religion gave them the courage to fight the Persians.

(4)

-

These are some of the concepts and lessons that 'Ali (&)
learned from the Messenger of Allah (g)
in his negotiations with the
leaders of Banu Shaybh.

Xli ibn Abi Tcilib

79

2.8. His offering himself as a sacrifice
for the Prophet (g)
When the tribe of Quraysh met in Dar an-Nadwah, they agreed
to kill the Prophet (gg)and to be rid of him, but Allah (&) told His
Prophet (g)
about that. The Prophet (gg)was the wisest of Allah's
creation. He wanted those who sought to kill him to keep looking at
his bed, waiting for him to come out to them, so he told 'Ali ibn Abi
Tilib (&) to sleep in his bed that night. Who could dare to stay in
the bed-of the Messenger of Allah (B)
when his enemies were
surrounding the house, lying in wait in order to kill him? Who would
be able to stay in that house, knowing that the enemies would not see
the difference between him and the Messenger of Allah (g)
in his
bed? No one except the most heroic of men, and the most
courageous, by the grace of ~ l l a h . ~ ~
The Prophet (@) told him to stay in Makkah for a few days in
order to return the trusts, and items that had been deposited with him
for safekeeping, to their owners among his enemies, without
subtracting anything. This is the greatest justice and fulfilment of
tn1sts.9~According to one report, the Messenger of Allah (@) said to
'Ali (&):
. . "Sleep in my bed, wrap yourself in this green cloak of
mine and sleep in it, and no hann will befall you from them."98Ibn
Hajar said: Moosa ibn 'Uqbah narrated that Ibn Shihsb said: So 'Ali
lay down on the bed of the Messenger of Allah (g)
in order to
distract the enemies from him. All night, Quraysh were coming and
going and discussing which of them would attack the occupant of the
bed and tie him up. In the morning, when they saw 'Ali, they asked
him where the Prophet was, and he said: I don't know. Then they
realised that the Prophet (g)
had fled?9 It was narrated from Ibn
'AbbL that 'Ali sold himself that night, when he put on the gannent
of the Prophet and then slept in his place.'00 Concerning 'Mi and his
fellow Companions who strove to attain the pleasure of Allah (s)

80

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib in Makkah

and the home of the hereafter, Allah (s)revealed the words:
(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure
of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to [His] slaves.),
(Qur'un 2: 207)

From this event we learn a number of lessons:

1. The plan of migration, as drawn up by the Messenger of Allah
(@), dictated that his place in the house should be taken by a
man whose movements inside the house would trick the
polytheists and distract them for a while from the departnre of
the Messenger of Allah (g),
until he and his Companion Abu
Bakr (&) bad gone beyond the danger zone.101

2. Ali's response to the command of the Prophet (B)was an
example of a dedicated soldier who is sincere to the call of Islam,
as he offered himself as a sacrifice for his leader. If the leader is
safe, then the call is safe, but if he dies, then the call will he
weakened and will slow down. What 'Ali (&) did on the night
of the hijrahlo2,spending that night in the bed of the Messenger
(g),
is to he regarded as a great sacrifice because it was highly
possible that the swords of the young men of Quraysh might
have fallen upon the head of 'Ali (&>). But 'Ali did not pay any
attention to that. It was more important for him that the
Messenger of Allah (g),
the Prophet of the Ummah and the
leader of Islam, should be safe.lo3

3.

The fact that the polytheists had deposited items for safekeeping
with the Messenger of Allah (g),
even though they were
fighting him and were determined to kill him, is a clear
indication of the strange contradiction into which they bad
fallen. At the same time that they disbelieved him and claimed
that he was a sorcerer, madman or liar, they could not find
anyone among the people around them who was better than him

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

81

in terms of honesty and trustworthiness. Therefore, they did not
deposit their property or wealth that they feared for with anyone
else but him for safekeeping. This indicates that their disbelief
was not due to any doubt on their part concerning his sincerity;
rather the reason was that they were too proud and arrogant to
accept the truth that he brought, out of fear for their leadership
and tyranny.'04 Allah the Almighty indeed spoke the truth: (We
h o w indeed the grief which their words cause you [0
Muhammad]: it is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses [the
Qur'an] of Allah that the Q&ilimoon
[polytheists and
wrongdoers] deny.)) (Qur'an 6: 33).
4.

The Messenger (g)
commanded 'Ali (&) to return these trusts
to their owners in Makkah. Normally, in such extreme
circumstances, one might focus all thoughts on nothing but
making the plan of migration succeed. Yet the Messenger (gJ
did not forget and was not distracted from returning the trusts to
their owners, even in these most difficult of circumstances, in
which any person might forget himself, let alone anyone else.'"
He refused to betray those who had trusted him, even if they
were enemies who were inciting people against him and harming
him, because betraying the trust is one of the attributes of the
hypocrites, and the believers are above that.'"

5.

This great hadith clearly points to the courage of 'Ali (&). He
knew, when he was doing as commanded, that he would be
exposed to great danger. They might have invaded the house and
killed him without verifying his identity. They might have
ambushed him as be was leaving in the morning, without finding
out who he was. The people were lying in wait all night waiting
for their chance, but they became extremely exhausted, and in
the morning, they were unable to verify the identity of the person
who was leaving the house. Was he Muhammad (g)
or

82

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Mukhh

someone else? All of this must have gone through 'Ali's mind,
hut he hastened and was happy to obey the command. First of
all, he loved Allah ( B )and His Messenger (@) with a love that
dominated his heart, so he made the safety of the Messenger of
Allah @) his main goal even if it cost him his life. Secondly,
this was an essential operation in order for the Messenger (g)
to
escape safely from the plots of his enemies so that he would be
able to spread Islam in all places. So the matter had to do with
the interests of Islam, first and last. 'Ali (&) slept in the bed of
the Messenger of AUah (g)
in spite of all these perils. This
points to the depth of his faith in the will and decree of Allah.
Indeed, he firmly believed in the words of Allah: (Say: 'Nothing
shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us.
He is our Mawlri [Lord, Helper and Protector].' And in Allah let
the believers put their trust.,b (Qur'un 9: 51)
In the fact that the Messenger of Allah (@Jchose 'Ali (&) to
play this important role, we can see complete and unparalleled trust
and confidence in the special capabilities with which 'Ali (&) was
distinguished, which may not be found in anyone else. He did not
hesitate when the Messenger (g)
called him to sleep in his bed,
although he knew that there might be nothing else beyond that hut
death, since the polytheists were preparing the bravest young men of
'Ali (&) did not let himself
Quraysh to murder the Prophet (g).
think about the consequences because he knew that if he sacrificed
his life for the Messenger of Allah (g),
he would attain a high
honour that could not be obtained in any other way.''

2.9. His Hijrah (migration from Makkah to Madinah)
The next morning, 'Ali (&) got up. The people recognised
him and realised that the Messenger of Allah (g)
had escaped. They
said to 'Ali (&):
, ..
'Where is your companion?" He said: "I do not

I

Xli ibn Abi T a b

83

know; was I watching over him? You told him to leave, and he left."
The people were upset with this daring answer and were annoyed that
the Messenger of Allah (g)
had departed from among them and that
they had been Minded i d did not see him. So they rebuked 'Ali
(&) and beat him; they took him to the mosque and detained him
there for a while, then they let him go.lo8 'Ali bore what befell him
for the sake of Allah (&). His joy at the escape of the Messenger of
Allah (gg)was more important to him than any harm that could befall
him, so he did not weaken and he did not tell them where the
Messenger of Allah (@Jwas. 'Mi started going around the streets of
Makkah, looking for the owners of the entrusted items that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
had left him behind to deal with, and he kept
on retnrning these entrusted items until he had given them all back to
their owners. M e r spending three days in Makkah, he prepared to set
out and catch up with the Messenger of Allah (@).Io9
During his migration journey, 'Ali hid by day and traveled by
night, until he reached Madinah with his feet swollen and the skin
broken."' Thus 'Ali endured hardships during his migration. He had
no mount to ride, and he could not travel during the day because of
the severe heat, but walking at night in the intense darkness was very
lonely and frightening. If we add to that the fact that he (&) covered
the distance on foot, with no companion to cheer him up and keep
him company, we will realise the extent of the hardship that he
endured because of the roughness of the route and the hardships of
travel, seeking the good pleasure of Allah
At the end of the
journey, he would meet the Messenger of Allah (g)
and enjoy his
company, safe and secure in Madinah. When 'Ali (,&I
reached
Madimah, he stayed among Banu 'Arnr ibn 'Awf, with Kulthoom ibn
al-Hadarn, where the Messenger of Allah (@) was staying.ll1 This
was the Hijrah of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&), filled
with sacrifice, patience and courage.

(s).

84

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

During his stay in Quba', 'Ali noticed a Muslim woman who
had no husband. He saw that a man would come and knock on her
door in the middle of the night; she would come out to him, and he
would give her something that he was canying. In the words of 'Ali
( 4 ) : "I became suspicious about this man, and I said to her: '0 slave
woman of Allah, who is this man who knocks at your door every
night, and you come out to him,and he gives you something that I do
not know what it is, and you are a Muslim woman and have no
husband?' She said: 'This is Sahl ibn Haneef ibn Wahb. He knows
that I am a woman who has nobody. When evening comes, he attacks
the idols of his people and breaks them and says: Use this for
firewood.'" 'Ali liked Sahl because of that. Later on, Sahl joined 'Ali
( 4 ) in Iraq and died there."' We may note how alert the Muslim
has to he, and he should not ignore what is going on around him.

3. How Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi T2lib lived with the Qur'an,
and the impact it had on him
3.1. His concept of Allah, the universe, life,
paradise, hell and the divine will and decree
The education that 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) received was the
same as that which all the Rightly Guided Caliphs and noble
Companions received. They were educated on the basis of the Noble
Qur'an, and their teacher was the master of all mankind, Mubarnmad
(gg).
The Beloved (g)
was keen that there should be one source and
reference point, and that the Noble Qur'an was to be the only way to
follow, along with the wisdom that the Lord, may He be glorified and
exalted, revealed to him. So he educated the Muslims, individuals,
.<

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

85

families and society, in the beliefs, acts of worship, ways of
interacting and morals and manners that were brought in the Book of
Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (g).
The verses that 'Ali
(&) heard directly from the Messenger of Allah (g)
had an impact
on the formation of his Islamic character. They purified his heart and
soul and illuminated his mind, and his soul interacted with them. This
turned him into a new person with new values, feelings, aims,
behaviour and a~nhitions."~
From the Noble Qur'an and the prophetic education he
received, 'Ali (&) learned who the God was that he should worship.
The Prophet (g)
implanted in his heart the meanings of those verses;
he (s)
was keen to educate his Companions in the correct concept of
their Lord and His rights over them, knowing that this concept would
lead to belief and certainty when souls are pure and theirfi;rahH4 is
sound. So 'Ali's view of Allah, the universe, life, paradise, hell, the
divine will and decree, the reality of man and his conflict with Satan
were derived from the Noble Qur'an and the guidance of the Prophet

(B).
Allah (&) is above having any shortcomings; His are the
attributes of infinite perfection. He is One, with no partner or
associate, and He has no wife or child. He is the Creator, Sovereign
and Controller of all things:
(Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the eaah
in Six Days, and then He rose over [Istawa] the Throne [really in a
manner that suits His Majesty]. He brings the night as a cover over
the day, seeking it rapidly, and [He created] the sun, the moon, the
stars subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the creation and
commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the ' h m e e n [mankind,
(Qur'an 7: 54)
jinn and all that exists]!)
Allah (&) is the source of every blessing in this universe,
great or small, manifest or hidden.

(jAnd whatever of blessings and good things you have, a is from
Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for
help.)
(Qur'an 16: 53)
AUah's knowledge encompasses all things, and nothing is
hidden from Him on earth or in heaven, nothing that man conceals or
displays openly.
Allah 1%) records man's deeds through the actions of His
angels, in a book in which nothing, great or small, is omitted, rather it
is recorded precisely. That will be shown to man at the appropriate
time:
4Not a word does he [or she] utter but there is a watcher by him ready
(Qur'an 50: 18)
[to record it].)
AUah (&) tests His slaves with things that go against their
desires and inclinations, in order to show their essence and to
distinguish between two types of people. Those who accept the will
and decree of Allah (B),submitting to it both outwardly and
inwardly, are deserving of the positions of vicegerency and
leadership. On the other hand, those who will be angry with His will
and decree do not deserve anything and will not be given any rank.
$Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is
best in deed. And He is the AU-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving)
(Qur'an 67: 2)

AUah (&) grants help and support to the one who seeks His
protection and follows His rulings in all that he does or abstains from:
$Verily, my Wali [Protector, Supporter, and Helper] is Allah Who
has revealed the Book [the Qur'an], and He protects [supports and
(Qur'an 7: 196)
helps] the righteous.)
His right over His slaves is that they should worship Him
alone, and not join any other with Him:

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

87

(Nay! But worship AUah [Alone and none else], and be among the
grateful.)
(Qur'an 39: 66)
He alone is deserving of worship, and this is Allah's right over
His slaves:
(Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him
[in worship], but He forgives except that [anything else] to whom He
wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has
(Qur'an 4: 48)
indeed invented a tremendous sin.8

(s)

Allah
has defined the essence of this 'uboodiyyah
(servitude to Him alone), which is the tawheed that is described in the
Noble ~ u r ' a n . " ~
'Ali's view of the universe was based on the words of Allah ( B ) :
"Say [O Muhammad]: Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created
the earth in two Days? And you set up rivals [in worship] with Him?
That is the Lord of the 'A~ameeu[mankind, jinn and all that exists].
He placed therein [i.e. the earth] firm mountains from above it, and
He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance [for its dwellers] in
four Days equal [i.e. all these four 'days' were equal in the length of
time] for all those who ask [about its creation]. Then He rose over
[Istawa] towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to
the earth: Come both of you willingly or unwillingly. They both said:
We come willingly. Then He completed and finished from their
creation [as] seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven
its affair. And We adorned the nearest [lowest] heaven with lamps
[stars] to be an adornment as well as to guard [from the devils by
using them as missiles against the devils]. Such is the Decree of Him,
the AU-Mighty, the All-Knower.)
(Qur'an 41: 9-12)
As for this life, no matter how long it lasts, it will inevitably
come to an end, and no matter how great its conveniences and
luxuries, they are in fact insignificant. Allah ( B ) says:

88

'Ali ibn Abi Ttilib in Makkah

BAnd put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is
like the water [rain] which We send down from the sky, and the
vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green.
But [later] it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter.
And Allah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the
adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that
last, are better with your Lord for rewards and better in respect of
hope.),
(Qur'nn 18: 45-46)
Allah (&) tells the M u s h about the reality of this life, and
that it is not the place of honour, and that the hereafter is better and
more lasting. This enables the one in whose heart love of Allah and
His Messenger is entrenched to give precedence to pleasing Allah
(&)and His Messenger above anything else, even if the price of that
is this world and everything in it. Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
expressed this buth when he said: "0 world, try to deceive someone
else. Are you trying to tempt me or attract me? No way! I divorce you
irrevocably. Your time is short and you are insignificant. Alas! The
provision is little, the journey is long and the way is lonely.""6
His view of paradise was derived from the verses which
describe it, and he became one of those of whom Allah
says:

(s)

(Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope,
and they spend [in charity in Allah's Cause] out of what We have
bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of
joy as a reward for what they used to do.),
(Qur'an 32: 16-17)
His concept of hell was derived from the Noble Qur'an, and
this concept became a deterrent which prevented him from going
astray from the laws of Allah (&). Anyone who studies the life of
. .. will see his deep understanding of
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
how one should prepare to meet Allah (g)
and the extent to which
he should fear the wrath and punishment of Allah.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

89

His concept of the Divine will and decree was derived from the
Book of Allah and the teachings of the Messenger of Allah (g).
This
concept was firmly entrenched in his heaa, and he understood its
different categories as mentioned in the Book of Allah. He was
certain that the knowledge of Allah (&) encompasses all things:
(Neither you [O M~&ammadldo any deed nor recite any portion of
the Qur'an, nor yon [O mankind] do any deed [good or evil], hut We
are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden
from your Lord [so much as] the weight of an atom [or small ant] on
the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater
(Qur'an 10: 61)
than that but is [written] in a Clear Record.)
'Ali (4)
was certain that AUah has decreed everything that is to be:
(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send
before [them], and their traces and all things We have recorded with
(Qur'an 36: 12)
numbers [as a record] in a Clear Book.)
He understood that Allah's will is inevitable and that His
power is complete:
(Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth escapes
Him. Verily, He is All-Knowing, All-Omnipotent.) (Qur'an 35: 44)
He believed that Allah (&) is the Creator of all things.
(Such is Allah, your Lord! L i Iliiha illa Huwa [none has the right to
be worshipped hut He], the Creator of all things. So worship Him
[Alone], and He is the Wakeel [Trustee, Disposer of affairs or
(Qur'an 6: 102)
Guardian] over all things.)
This correct understanding and deep conviction of the reality
of the Divine will and decree bore many fruits which were apparent
in his life, as we shall see in this book. From the Noble Qur'an, he
understood the reality of his own self and of all people. He knew that
their essence went back to two origins: the ancient origin when man

90

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib in Makkah

was first created from clay, when he was formed and the soul was
breathed into him, and the recent origin when they were created from
a drop of spenn.'17 AUah
says:

(a)

@Whomade everythmg He has created good and He began the
creation of man from clay. Then He made his offspring from semen
of despised water [male and female sexual discharge]. Then He
fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul
[created by Allah for that person]; and He gave you hearing [ears],
sight [eyes] and hearts. Little is the thanks you give!# (Qur'an 32: 7-9)
He understood that Allah (&) has created humans with His
own hand, and honoured them with a beautiful form and an upright
posture. He has blessed them with wisdom, logic and discernment,
and subjugated to them all that is in the heavens and on earth. Allah
(iB)favoured human beings over much of His creation, and
honoured them by sending the Messengers to them. The most
wondrous manifestation of this divine honour towards humankind
was that He made them qualified to receive His love and good
pleasure, which could he attained by following the Prophet (&), who
called people to Islam so that they might live a good life in this world
and attain eternal bliss in the hereafter. Allah ( B )says:
{Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female - while
he [or she] is a true believer [of Islamic Monotheism] verily, to him
We will give a good life [in this world with respect, contentment and
lawful provision], and We shall pay them certainly a reward in
proportion to the best of what they used to do [i.e. paradise in the
hereafter].%
(Qur'an 16: 97)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) unde~stoodthe true nature of
the struggle between humans and'satan. He knew that this enemy
comes to them from before and behind, from their right and from
their left, and whispers to them, tempting them to commit sin and
stining up their desires. He used to seek the help of AUah (g)

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

91

against his enemy Iblees, and he prevailed over him throughout his
life, as we shall see as we study his biography.
He learned from the story of Adam and Satan, as mentioned in
the Qnr'an, that Adam was the origin of humanity, that the essence of
and that man is vulnerable
Islam is absolute obedience to Allah
to falling into sin. From the story of Adam's sin, he learned the
necessity of putting one's trnst in AUah, the iinportance of repentance
and praying for forgiveness in the life of the believer, the necessity of
keeping away from envy and arrogance, and the importance of
speaking in the best manner to one's companions, because Allah says:

(a),

4And say to My slaves [i.e. the m e believers of Islamic Monotheism]
that they should [only] say those words that are the best. [Because]
Shaytiin [Satan] verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreements
among them. Surely, S h a m [Satan] is to man a plain enemy.B
(Qur'an 17: 53)

He followed the path of the Messenger of Allah (B)in such a
way that he purified his companions' hearts a d souls by means of all
kinds of acts of worship, and he trained them to follow the guidelines
for manners and attitude that were laid out in the Qur'an.

3.2. The status of the Noble Qur'an in his view
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) lived his life with the Qur'an,
reading it, memorising it, understanding it and acting in accordance
with it. He used to say: "Whoever reads the Qnr'an and dies arnd
enters hell, is among those who used to take the verses (or signs) of
Allah in j e ~ t " ~ . " He
' ~ ~also used to say: "Glad tidings to those who
were the dearest of people to the Messenger of Allah (&)."lZa And
he used to say: "I did not think that anyone with any w~sdomwould
sleep before reciting the last thrm verses of Soorat al-~aqarah,"'~'
This was directed towards the people of the Qur'an. He said,

92

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

describing the Noble Qur'an and its great importance: "In the Book
of Allah, there are stories of those who came before you, foretelling
what will happen after you and rulings on issues between you. It is
serious and is not in jest. Whoever among the tyrants neglects it,
Allah will destroy him; whoever seeks guidance in anything else,
Allah will send him astray. It is the strong rope, the wise reminder,
the straight path. It is the Book that whims and desires cannot distort
and tongues cannot mispronounce. Its wonders never end, and the
scholars never tire of it. Whoever quotes it speaks the truth, whoever
acts upon it will be rewarded, whoever judges according to it will be
just, and whoever calls people to it will be guided to a straight
path."'22
Because of his great interest in the Qur'an, 'Ali acquired a
great deal of knowledge of it and its sciences. It was narrated that he
said: "By Allah, no verse of it was revealed but I know why it was
revealed, when it was revealed and to whom it was revealed. My
Lord has blessed me with a deep understanding and an eloquent,
truthful tongue."123 And he (&) said: "Ask me about the Book of
Allah, for there is no verse in it but I know whether it was revealed by
night or by day, on the plains or in the rnountain~."'~~
Ibn 'AbdulBarr narrated that 'Ali (4)
was one of those who collected the
Noble Qur'an at the time of the Messenger of Allah (@) while the
Messenger was still alive.lZ5At the end of his Life he said: "Ask me
before you lose me."126 That was when most of the other scholars
among the Companions had died, and he (&) was in Lraq. He was
very keen to teach the Noble Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet
(g)
to the people, among whom there was a great deal of ignorance.
They did not know much about the rulings of Islam, and 'Ali (&)
was keen to teach them the truth. He was the most knowledgeable of
people of his time. This is an example of the devoted scholar who is
eager to teach people the truth and train them to follow it.

3.3. What was revealed concerning him
of the Noble Qur'an
The Noble Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (gJ
addressing real life events that happened in the society in which he
lived. It praised some actions and some people, warned against others
and pointed out some mistakes. Some verses were revealed that
recorded forever some of the exploits of Amir d-Mu'mineen 'All
(A)and other Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all).

1. Allah ( B )said:
(These two opponents [believers and disbelievers] dispute with each
other about their Lord; then as for those who disbelieved, garments of
fire will be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured down over
their heads. With it will melt [or vanish away] what is within their
bellies, as well as [their] skins. And for them are hooked rods of iron
[to punish them]. Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from
anguish, they will be driven back therein, and [it will be] said to
them: 'Taste the torment of burning! Trnly, Allah will admit those
who believe [in the Oneness of Allah -Islamic Monotheism] and do
righteous good deeds, to Gardens underneath which rivers flow [in
paradise], wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and
pearls and their garments therein will be of silk.) (Qur'an 22: 19-23)
Bukhari narrated with a chain of narration from 'Ali ibn Abi
T a b (4)
that he said: "I will be the first one to kneel before the
Most Merciful in a dispute on the Day of Resurrection." Qays ibn
'Uhidah said: Concerning them the verse was revealed: "These two
opponents @eIievers and disbelievers) dispute with each other about
their Lord." He said: They are the ones who went forth for duels on
the day of Badr: Hamzah, 'Ali, Abu 'Uhaydah ihn al-H&ith, Shaybah
ibn Rabee'ah, 'Utbah ibn Rabee'ah and al-Waleed ibn 'utbah.Iz7

94

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

2. He was one of those concerning whom AUah revealed the words:
(Then whoever disputes with yon concerning him ['Eesa (Jesus)]
after [all this] knowledge that has come to yon [i.e. 'Eesa (Jesus)
being a slave of AUah, and having no share in Divinity], say [ 0
Muhamnlad]: 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women
and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and
invoke [sincerely] the Curse of Allah upon those who lie.')
(Qur'an 3: 61)

That had to do with the delegation from Najrk, when the
Prophet (g)debated with them about 'Eesa ibn Maryam [Jesus, son
of Mary ('alayhi as-saZLim -peace be upon him)], and said that he
was the slave of Allah (@) and His Messenger, and His Word that
He bestowed upon his blessed mother. He told them that 'Eesa was
not God or the son of God or the third of three, and he called them to
Islam, but they refused, so he invited them to pray and invoke
sincerely the curse of AUah
upon those who are lying. It was
narrated that ' k c ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqgs said: When the words,
(Say [O Muhammad]: 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons...)
were revealed, the Messenger of Allah (g)
called 'Ali, F26mah,
Hasan and Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them all) and said: "0
Allah, these are my family."'28

(s)

3. The Qur'an confumed his view that jihad is superior to
maintenance of al-Masjid al-Hark. In al-Saheeh it is narrated that a
man said: I would not care if I do not do any deed after becoming
Muslim except maintaining al-Masjid al-Hargm. 'Ali ibn Abi T%b
(&) said: "Jihad for the sake of Allah is better than all of that."
'Umar ibn al-KhatJiib said: "Do not raise your voices at the minbar lZ9
of the Messenger of Allah (g).
When the prayer is over, I will ask
him about that." He asked him, and Allah revealed this verse:

(Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and
the maintenance of Al-Masjid al-Harim [at Makkah] as equal to the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

95

worth of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive hard
and fight in the Cause of Allah? They are not equal before Allah. And
Allah guides not those people who are the p@limoon [polytheists
and wrongdoers]. Those who believed [in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism] and emigrated and strove hard and fought in
Allah's Cause with their wealth and their lives, are far higher in
degree with Allah. They are the successful. Their Lord gives them
glad tidings of mercy from Him, and His being pleased [with them],
and of Gardens [paradise] for them wherein are everlasting delights.
They will dwell therein forever. Verily, with Allah is a great reward.)
(Qur'an 9: 19-22)

So He (&) told them that faith and jihad are better than maintaining
the Sacred Mosque in Makkah, hajj and ~ a w i f ' ~and
~ , better than
looking after the pilgrims.13'

4. 'Ali (&) was compassionate towards the Ummah of Muhammad
(@J.
It was narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) said: When this
verse was revealed - 40 you who believe! When you [want to]
consult the Messenger [Muhammad] in private, spend something in
charity before your private consultationb (Qur'an 58: l z ) , the Prophet
(&) said to 'Ali (&): "Tell them to give in charity." He said: 0
Messenger of Allah, how much? He said: "A dinar." He said: They
cannot afford it. He said: "Half a dinar." He said: They cannot afford
it. He said: How much? He said: Gold equal to the weight of a grain
of barley. The Prophet @!) said to 'Ali: "You are a man of little
wealth (so you are speaking on the basis of what you have)." Then
Allah (g)
revealed the words:
a r e you afraid of spending in charity before your private
consultation [with him]? If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven
you, then [at least] perform s a l h [Iqht-w-Saliih] and give zak2h.B
(Qur'an 58: 13)

96

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

'Ali used to say: "By means of me, Allah made it easy on this
~mmah."'~~

3.4. 'Ali conveyed the Prophet's commentary
(tafseer) on some verses of the Noble Qur'an
'Ali benefitted from the commentary of the Messenger of
Allah ( g ) , and he conveyed what he learned from the Messenger of
Allah ( g ) to the people. The following are some examples of that:
(a) Allah (&) says,
(And instead [of thanking Allah] for the provision He gives you, you
(Qur'an 56: 82)
deny [Him by disbeliefj!)

(s)

It was narrated from 'Ali (&) that the Prophet
said: (And
instead [of thanking Allah] for the provision He gives you, you deny
[Him by disbelieflb your way of giving thanks is by telling lies,
when you say we got rain by such and such a star and so on."133

(b) Everyone is guided to that for which he was created. It was
narrated that 'Ali (&) said: We were attending a funeral in Baqee'
The Messenger of Allah (@) came to us and sat down,
and we sat down around him. He had a small stick with him, and he
tilted his head and started scratching the ground with his stick. Then
he said: "There is no one among you, no created soul, but Allah has
decreed its place in paradise or hell, and it is decreed whether it is
doomed or blessed." A man said: 0 Messenger of AUah, shouldn't we
depend upon what is written and give up striving, then whoever is
destined to be blessed will do the deeds of those who are destined to he
blessed, and whoever is destined to be doomed will do the deeds of
those who are doomed? He said: "Strive, for everyone is guided (to do
deeds according to his destiny). Those who are destined to he blessed
will be guided to do the deeds of those who are destined to be blessed,
and those who are destined to he doomed will be guided to do the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

97

deeds of those who are destined to he doomed. Then he recited:
$As for him who gives [in charity] and keeps his duty to Allah and
fears Him, And believes in ~ l - ~ u s n r iWe
. ' ~will
~ make smooth for
him the path of ease [goodness]. But he who is greedy miser and
thinks himself self-sufficient. And belies Al-HusnB We will make
smooth for him the path for evil.)
(Qur'an 92: 5.10)'~~
According to another report: Should we not rely on what is
decreed for us and stop striving, then whoever among us is among
those who are destined to be blessed will end up doing the deeds of
the people who are destined to be blessed, and whoever is among the
people who are destined to be doomed will end up doing the deeds of
the people who are destined to be doomed?137
According to a report in Bukhari and Muslim, 'Ali (&) said:
One day, the Messenger of Allah (g)
was scratching the ground with
a stick he had in his hand. Then he raised his head and said: "There is
no soul but its place in paradise or hell is known." They said: 0
Messenger of Allah, why should we strive? Shouldn't we rely on
that? He said: "No ... you must strive, for everyone will be guided to
that for which he was created." Then he recited:
$As for him who gives [in charity] and keeps his duty to Allah and
fears Him, And believes in Al-Husni. We will make smooth for him
the path of ease [goodness]. But he who is greedy miser and thinks
himself self-sufficient And belies Al-HusnB We will make smooth
(Qur'an 92: 5-10)'~'
for him the path for evil.)

In these hadiths and others, the Prophet (g)
told us what the

(s)

Noble Qur'an indicates, that Allah
has prior knowledge and has
already written and decreed the ultimate destiny of His slaves and
whether they will be blessed or doomed; He also has prior knowledge
and has already written and decreed other things that will happen to
His slaves and others.'39

98

'Ali ibn Abi Telib in Makkah

The Prophet (g)
~,
stated that this does not contradict doing the
deeds by means of which one attains a blessed or doomed state, and
that if a person is one of those who are destined to be blessed, it will
be made easy for him to do the deeds of those who are destined to be
blessed, and if a person is one of those who are destined to be
doomed, it will be made easy for him to do the deeds of those who are
destined to be doomed. He forbade relying on the prior decree and
not striving. Hence the one who relies on the prior decree and does
not strive to do the actions that are enjoined upon him is one of the
greatest losers in respect of (his or her) deeds, and one whose efforts
have been wasted in this life.140 Their abandoning of the deeds that
are enjoined upon them is part of what is decreed for them, of making
the path of doom easy for them. Those who are destined to be blessed
are those who do what is enjoined and abstain from what is
forbidden, so if a person abstains from doing obligatory actions that
are enjoined upon him and does forbidden actions, relying on the
prior decree, he is among those who are destined to be doomed, for
whom it is made easy to do the actions of those who are destined to
he doomed. This is the answer that the Prophet (g)
gave, and 'Ali
ibn Abi T G b (&) and the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah
be pleased with them) learned. It is the best and most appropriate
answer to this question.141

3.5. The basic principles followed by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (4)
in deriving rulings from the
Noble Qur'an and understanding its meanings
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali possessed a great deal of knowledge
of the Qur'an and its sciences. This knowledge made him believe that
the Qur'an contained all d i n g s , either explicitly or implicitly. He
said concerning that: (And your Lord is never forgetful.) (Qur'an 19:
Hence he often quoted the Qur'an as evidence and would

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

99

recite the verse in question in order to explain the Sharia rulings. His
method in deriving rulings was as follows:

3.5.1. Adhering to the apparent
meanings of the Noble Qur'an
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) sometimes adhered to the
apparent meaning of the Noble Qur'an when there was no other
evidence to suggest that it should be interpreted in a way other than
what it appears to mean. He made ablutions for eveq prayer and
quoted the following verse: (0 you who believe! When you intend to
offer as-Sal6h [the prayer], wash your faces...) (Qur'an 5: 6)'43 The
apparent meaning indicates that one should make ablutions every
time one wants to pray. And he enjoined fasting upon the traveller if
Ramadan begins before he or she travels. He said: "If the fast (of
Ramadan) begins when he is not travelling, and then be travels, then
he has to fast, because Allah ( B )says: (So whoever of you sights
[the crescent on the first night of] the month [of Ramadan i.e. is
present at his home], he must observe Sawm [fasts] that month.)
(Qur'an 2: 1 8 5 ) ' ~ ~

Furthermore, he thought that breastfeeding an older child does
not make him a m ~ h r a r n ' ~because
~,
that is not within the first two
years of life, basing that on the apparent meaning of the verse which
speaks of breastfeeding. It was narrated that he said concerning the
verse, (The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole
years, [that is] for those [parents] who desire to complete the term of
suckling.) (Qur'an 2: 233) Breastfeeding is for two years, so whatever
breastfeeding occurs within the two years makes the child a m&ram,
but whatever occurs after two years does not make him a
He also interpreted the Qur'an in accordance with its apparent
meaning in another place, where he ruled as innocent a woman who
was accused of adultery because she gave birth six months after

100

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib in Makkah

getting married. He combined the verse (The mothers shall give suck
to their children for two whole years8 (Qur'an 2: 233) with another
verse, (and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty
months), (Qur'an 46: 15) and said: Pregnancy (bearing) is six months,
and weaning is twenty-four months.'47 In other words, he subtracted
the period of breastfeeding, which is two years, from the total period
of breastfeeding and pregnancy, which is thirty months, which left
six months. Thus he combined the apparent meaning of both verses
and ruled accordingly.'48

3.5.2. Interpreting verses that are general in meaning
on the basis of those that are clear and specific
Verses that are general in meaning are those in which the
meaning is ambiguous and cannot be understood except by means of
further explanation.'49 Clear verses are those in which the meaning is
apparent, without any need for explanation.'50 'Ali interpreted the
general meaning of the Qur'an in the verse (an offering, brought to
the Ka'bah) (Qur'an 5: 95) in the light of other verses that explained
it. It was narrated that a man asked 'Ali(4)
about the offering what kind of animal was it? He said: Eight head of cattle in pairs. It is
as if the man was not sure, so 'Ali (&) said to him: Do you read the
Qur'an? He said: Yes. 'Ali (&) said: Have you heard the verse in
which Allah
says, (0 you who believe! Fulfil [your]
obligations. Lawful to yon [for food] are all the beasts of cattle)
(Qur'an 5: l)? He said: Yes. 'Ali(&) said: Have you heard the verse
in which Allah (g)
says, BAnd of the cattle [are some] for burden
[like camel] and [some are] small [unable to carry burden like sheep
and goats for food, meat, m i k and wool]. Eat of what Allah bas
provided for
(Qur'an 6: 142)? He said: Yes. 'Ali (&) said:
Have yon heard the verse in which Allah (&) says, (of the sheep two
[male and female], and of the goats two [male and female]. Say: "Has

He forbidden the two males or the two females, or [the young] which
the wombs of the two females enclose? Inform me with knowledge if
you are truthful." And of the camels two [male and female], and of
oxen two [male and female]) (Qur'an 6: 143-144)?He said: Yes. 'Ali
(&) said: Have you heard the verse in which Allah (&) says, $0

[for hajj or ' ~ r n r a h '(pilgrimage)],

intentionally, the penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka'bah))
(Qur'an 5: 95)? The man said: Yes. 'Ali (&)
said: I killed an

3.5.3. Interpreting what is general in the light of
what is clear and specific in the Noble m a n
That which is general is something which refers to a thing
without being specific. That which is specific is what is referred to in
specific
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) interpreted that
which is general in the Qur'an in the light of what is specific when
deriving rulings, as he interpreted the general meaning of cutting off
the hand, which is mentioned in the verse on stealing, in the light of a
specific punishment which is mentioned in the verse on waging war
against AUah and His Messenger and doing mischief in the land,
which is that amputation is only to occur twice and not more than one
hand and one foot is to be cut off if stealing is repeated. So if a person
steals once, his right hand is to be cut off. If he steals again, his left
foot is to be cut off, according to 'Ali (&). If he steals a thiid or
fourth time, no fuaher amputation is to take place but he is to be given
an alternative punishment, because he ['Ali] interpreted the verse,
(And [as for] the male thief and the female thief, cut off [from the
wrist joint] their [right] hands) (Qur'an 5: 38) in the light of the verse,
(The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His
Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be MJed

102

'Ali ibn Abi TAlib in Makkah

or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite
sides,$ (Qur'an 5: 33) He said: AUah (&)did not specify cutting off
more than one hand and one foot in the verse on waging war against
Allah and His Messenger and doing mischief in the land, hence such
cases are to be punished with irnpris~nment.'~~
It was narrated that
ash-Sha'bi said: 'Ali cut off no more than one hand and one foot, and
if the person stole after that, he would be imprisoned and punished.
He ['Ali] used to say: I cannot justify before AUah (s)
leaving him
without a hand with which to eat and clean hi~nself.''~

3.5.4. Knowledge of QLu'anic verses which
abrogate and verses which are abrogated
This refeus to the lifting of a Sharia ruling by means of a
subsequent divine statement.lS6Az-Zarkashi said: The imams said: It
is not permissible for anyone to interpret the Book of Allah until after
he has learned what abrogates and what is abrogated therein.''' This
meaning was confirmed by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi wib
(&), when he rebuked a preacher by saying: Do you know what
abrogates and what is abrogated therein (in the Qur'an)? He said: No.
He said: You are doomed, and yon have led others to d00rn.''~

3.5.5. Interpreting the Qur'an in the
light of the Arabic language
One of the methods of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali in
understanding the Noble Qur'an was to look at it in the light of the
Arabic language. He understood from the verse (And divorced
women shall wait [as regards their marriage] for three menstrual
periods) (Qur'an 2: 228) that what was meant by al-aqra' was
menshal periods, so the woman's 'iddah does not end until she
has become pure following the third menstrual cycle.160Hence 'Ali
said concerning the divorced woman: It is not permissible for

(4)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

103

her husband to take her back until she has done ghusl following the
third menstrual cycle.16' Al-Quroo' in Arabic is the plural of qar',
which means menses, but it also means purification.'62
Another example is his understanding of the verse $or you
have been in contact with women) (Qur'an 4: 43) as referring to
intercourse. He said: Al-Lamas (lit. touching) means intercourse, hut
AUah
implied it here.'63 The people interpreted touching in the
verse $And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and
you have appointed unto them the mahr [bridal-money given by the
husband to his wife at the time of maniagel) (Qur'an 2: 237) as
referring to being alone with them. He said: What is meant by
touching here is being alone with.'64 So he ruled that it is obligatory
to pay the dowry in full if the husband has been alone with the
wife.165He also said: If he drew the curtain on his wife and closed the
door, then the bridal gift and the 'iddah become

(s)

3.5.6. Understanding the text
in the light of another text
An example of this is that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
understood the verse $And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a
way [to triumph] over the believers) (Qur'an4: 141) as referring to the
Day of Resurrection, because of the [preceding] words $AIM will
judge between you [all] on the Day of Resurrection.) (Qur'arz 4: 141).
That was when a man came to him and asked him: How do we
understand this verse, dAnd never will Allah grant to the disbelievers
a way (to triumph) over the believers?) (Qur'an 4: 141) 'Ali (&)
said: Come closer to me. Allah ( B )will judge between you on the
Day of Resurrection, and Allah (g)
will never grant to the
disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the b e 1 i e ~ e r s . l ~ ~
He understood the verse, $And by the roof raised high)
(Qur'an 52: 5) as referring to the heaven, because of what was

104

'Ali ibn Abi T2lib in Makkh

narrated by Ibn Jareer and mentioned by Ibn Katheer from 'Ali that
4And by the roof raised high) (Qur'an 52: 5) means the heaven.
S u f y k said: Then he recited: (And We have made the heaven a roof,
safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs [i.e. sun,
moon, winds, clouds].ft (Qur'an 21: 32)
He understood the verse, (Guard strictly [five obligatory] a+Salawrit [the prayers] especially the middle Salrih. And stand before
Allah with obedience) (Qur'an 2: 238) as referring to 'Asr prayer,
based on the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (g)
on the day of alAhz2b: "They distracted us from the middle prayer, 'Asr prayer, may
Allah (g)
fill their houses and graves with fire."168
Another example is his understanding of the verse, 4If yon
avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate
from you your [small] sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance [i.e.
paradise].), (Qur'an 4: 31) It was narrated from Sahl ibn Ahi
Khaythamah that his father said: I was in this mosque -the mosque
when 'Ali
was addressing the people from the
of Kufa
minbar and saying: "0people, the major sins are seven." The people
listened carefully, and he repeated it three times, then he said: "Why
don't you ask me about them?" They said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen,
what are they?' He said: "Associating others with Allah, killing the
soul that Allah (g)
has made sacred, slandering chaste women,
consuming the wealth of orphans, consuming usury, fleeing from the
battlefield, and living like a ~ e d o u i n 'after
~ ~ migrating."'70 This
understanding is based on the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (g)
in which he said: "Avoid the seven that doom one to hell." They said:
0 Messenger of Allah
what are they? He said: "Associating
others with AUah, witchcraft, killing the soul that Allah has made
sacred except in cases dictated by Sharia, consuming usury,
consuming the wealth of the orphan, running away from the
battlefield and slandering chaste women, indiscreet but

belie~ing."'~'This is part of the method of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ati
(&) in interpreting the noble Qur'an by means of the Sunnah.

3.5.7. Asking the Prophet about
what he did not understand
Part of the method of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) in
understanding the noble Qur'an was asking about whatever he did
not understand. For example, he asked the Messenger of Allah (@)
about the greatest day [of hajj] in the verse, 4And a declaration from
Allah and His Messenger to mankind on the greatest day [the 10th of
Dhul-wjjah -the 12th mouth of Islamic calendar]) (Qur'an 9: 3).He
said: I asked the Prophet (g)
about the greatest day of hajj, and he
said: the Day of ~ a c 1 3 i c e . lAmir
~ ~ al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
(&) used this method when narrating from the Messenger of Allah
(g).
He said: I said: 0 Messenger of AUah (B),
if something befalls
us and there is no clear command or prohibition, what should we do?
He said: Consult the experts in Islamic law and the worshippers, and
do not make a decision in is01ation.l~~

3.5.8. Knowledge of the occasions
on which verses were revealed
This is useful for understanding the meanings of verses and
deriving rulings from them, because tbe reason for revelation is an
important way of understanding the meaning of the Q ~ r ' a n . Amii'~~
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b reached a high level of knowledge
of the reasons for revelation of verses. He used to say, when
encouraging people to ask him about the Book of Allah: "Ask me, ask
me, askme about the Book of Allah, for by Allah, there is no verse but I
h o w whether it was revealed by night or by day."L75According to
another report: "By Allah, no verse was revealed but I know
concerning what it was revealed and where it was revealed."176

106

'Ali ibn Abi Thlib in Makkah

3.5.9. Specdying what is general in meaning
What is general in meaning is wording that refers to everything
that the word could mean, without any 1imitati0n.l~~
The ruling
concerning this is that every report that is general in meaning remains
so until another report comes to make it more specific.178There may
be some reports which limit what is general in meaning to some of
what it means, and that is specifying what is general in meaning.179
A report was narrated from 'Ali (&) which specified the
meaning of a verse that is general in meaning. He (&) was asked
about a man who bad two slave women who were sisters; he had
intercourse with one of them and then he wanted to have intercourse
with the other. 'Ali (&) said: No, not until they both go out of his
possession.'80 It was narrated from Ibn al-Kawwa' that he asked 'Ali
(&,) about marrying two sisters at the same time, and he answered:
One verse forbade it, and another verse allowed it, but my family and
I do not do that.lal What he meant by the verse which forbade it is the
verse, (And two sisters in wedlock at the same time$ (Qur'an 4: 23);
and what he meant by the verse which allowed it is the verse, 4Except
from their wives or [the slaves] that their right hands possess, for then
they are free from blame$ (Qur'an 23: 6). Of these two verses, one is
general in meaning and the other is specific, as it limits the general
meaning of intimacy with slave women (those that their right hands
possess) by specifying that it is not permitted to be intimate with two
sisters at the same time.18z
Another example is when he gave a ruling concerning the
'iddah of a pregnant woman whose husband had died; he stated that
she should take the longer of the two periods as her 'iddah. He said:
Her 'iddah is the longer of the two periods.'83 In other words, he gave
a specific meaning to the general meaning of the verses, $And those
of you who die and leave wives behind them, they [the wives] shall
wait [as regards their marriage] for four months and ten days$ (Qur'an

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

107

2: 234) and (And for those who are pregnant [whether they are

divorced or their husbands are dead], their 'Iddah [prescribed period]
is until they lay down their burden) (Qur'an 65: 4). So if the pregnant
woman whose husband has died gives birth before four months and
ten days are over, then she should complete the period (of the 'iddah),
and not follow the general meaning of the second verse, because the
first verse is more specific. If she completes the period of four months
and ten days, then her 'iddah does not end until she gives birth,
because the first verse may be general in one way but it is made
specific by the second. Both verses are general in one way and
specific in another, and each of them makes the other specific
according to 'Ali (&).
Perhaps he was choosing to act on the safe side in order to
reconcile between the two verses,ls4 but the more correct view is that
in either case, her 'iddah ends when she gives birth. It was narrated in
a sound report from Abdullah ihn 'Utbah that Subay 'ah bint al-Hirith
told him that she was married to Sa'd ibn Khawlah, who was present
at Badr, and he died during the farewell pilgrimage when she was
pregnant. Soon after he died, she gave birth, and when her
postchildhirth bleeding ended, she beautified herself to receive
proposals of marriage. Abu as-Sanghi1 entered upon her and said to
her: Why do I see you adorned? Perhaps you hope to get married? By
Allah (&), you will not get married until four months and ten days
have passed. Subay'ah said: When he said that to me, I put on my
outer garments in the evening and went to the Messenger of Allah
(g),
and I asked him about that, and he answered me that my 'iddah
had ended when I gave birth, and he told me to get manied if I
wanted to.Is5
Perhaps 'Ali (&)
gave that decision because he had not heard
,.
the hadith of Subay'ah,otherwise he would not have gone against a
proven sound report from the Prophet (&).ls6

3.5.10. Knowledge of the customs of the Arabs
and peoples who lived around them
Knowing the nature and customs of the Arabs and the peoples
who lived around them, such as the Jews and Christians, at the time
that the Qur'an was revealed plays a great role in understanding the
noble Qur'an. 'Ali (&) lived at that time and knew a great deal
about the customs that the Qur'an forbade or of which it approved.
For example, Ibn Abi Hitim narrated: When Ibn W2il competed
with Abu al-Farazdaq, and each of them slaughtered one hunhed
camels, 'Ali went out riding the white mule of the Messenger of
Allah (g),
calling out: "0people, do not eat their meat, for they have
been slaughtered for something other than Allah
'Ali (&)
knew from the customs of the Arabs at his time that a cornpetit&
like this was not for the sake of Allah (&), rather it was for the devil,
and that was forbidden based on the evidence of the words of Allah
(Forbidden to you [for food] are: Al-Maitah [the dead animals
-cattle -beast not slaughtered], blood, the flesh of swine, and that
on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering
[that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah])

(s)."

(s):

(Qur'an 5: 3).18'

3.5.11. Deep understanding
Deep understanding was one of the distinguishing
characteristics for which 'Ali (&,) was renowned. The examples
indicating that are numerous, of which we may mention here one that
was narrated by Ibn Jareer, who said: One of the Kharijites called out
to 'Ali when he was praying the dawn prayer, saying: (And indeed it
has been revealed to yon [O Muhammad], as it was to those [Allah's
Messengers] before you: "If yon join others in worship with Allah,
[then] surely, [all] your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly
be among the losers) (Qur'an 39: 65). 'Ali (&) responded as he was

'AZi ibn Abi T a b

109

praying [with the verse]: $So be patient [O Muhammad]. Verily, the
Promise of Allah is true; and let not those who have no certainty of
Faith discourage yon from conveying AUah's Message [which you
are obliged to convey]B (Qsr'an 30: 60).18*
These are some of the basic principles followed by Amir alMn'mineen 'Ali (&) in deriving rulings from the noble Qur'an and
understanding its meanings. From his example, those who love him
and the sincere Muslims can learn how to interact with the Book of
Allah (g).

3.6. 'Ali's interpretation of
some verses of the Qur'an
3.6.1. Adh-Dl12riy2t [soorah 511
It was narrated from ath-Thawri, from Habeeb ibn Abi Thiibit,
that Abu at-Tufayl said: I heard f i n al-Kawwa' ask 'Ali ihn Abi Taib
about al-dh&riyritudhanvan p y (the winds) that scatter dust]. He
said: The winds. He asked him about al-hcimilritu waqran [And (the
clouds) that bear heavy weight of water]. He said: The clouds. He
asked h i about wal- jririyciti yusran [And (the ships) that float with
ease and gentleness]. He said: The ships. He asked him about almudnbbirriti amran [And those (angels) who distribute (provisions,
rain, and other blessings) by (Allah's) Command]. He said: The
angels.189 Al-H%m classed this report as sound with a different
chain of narration from Abu at-Tnfayl.
Af-Tabari mentioned in detail the different chains of narration
going back to ' ~ 1 i . l ~It' was also narrated by 'Abdur-Razziiq with a
different chain of narration from Abu at-Tnfayl, who said: I saw 'Ali
when he was giving a sermon. He said: "Ask me, ask me about the
Book of Allah, for by Allah, there is no verse but 1know whether it

110

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

was revealed by night or by day, on the plains or in the mountains."
Ibn at-Kawwa' said -when I was between him and 'Ali, and he was
behind me: What is al-dhkriy6tu dhanvan [By (the winds) that
scatter dust]? He also narrated a similar report, in which he said: Woe
to you! Ask to learn and do not ask to cause annoyance.191

3.6.2. BSo verily, I swear by the planets
that recede8 (Qur'an 81: 15)
Sa'eed ibn Mansoor narrated with a reliable chain of narration
from 'Ali (&) that he said: They are the planets that move swiftly by
night and recede by day so they cannot be seen.19'

3.6.3. The earth's weeping for the righteous slave

(4)

'Ali
said: When a righteous slave dies, the place where
he used to pray on earth weeps, and the place where his deeds
ascended from heaven and earth also weeps. Then he recited: B ~ n d
the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given a
respite.) (Qur'an 44: 29)

3.6.4. Humility in the heart and being gentle
when d e a h g with a Muslim
Amir at-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
was asked about the verse
(Those who offer their S a l a [prayers] with all solemnity and full
submissiveness), (Qur'an 23: 2). He said: Humility is in the heart, and
being gentle when dealing with a Muslim, and not looking around
while praying.193

3.6.5. Two believing friends and
two disbelieving friends
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was asked about the words of
Allah
(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except

(s),

'AZi ibn Abi T a b

111

Al-Muttaqoon [the pious]) (Qur'an 43: 67). He said: Two believing

friends and two disbelieving friends. One of the believers died and
was given glad tidings of paradise, then he remembered his believing
friend and said: 0 Lord, my friend So-and-so used to tell me to do
good and forbid me from doing evil, and he told me to obey You and
to obey Your Messenger, and he told me that I was going to meet
You, so do not let him go astray after I am gone. Guide him as Yon
guided me, and honour him as You honoured me. When the friend
dies, they will be brought together in paradise, and it will be said to
them: Let each one of yon praise the other. So he will say: 0 Allah,
he used to tell me to do good and forbid me from doing evil, and he
told me to obey You and to obey Your Messenger, and he told me
that I was going to meet You. What a good brother, friend and
companion. Then one of the two disbelievers died and was given the
tidings of hell. He remembered his friend and said: 0 Allah, my
friend so-and-so used to tell me to do evil and forbid me from doing
good; he told me to disobey You and to disobey Your Messenger,
and he told me that I would not meet You. 0 Allah, send him astray
as You sent me astray. When the friend dies, they will be joined
together in hell, and it will be said: Let each of you praise the other.
So he will say: 0 Allah, he used to tell me to do evil and forbid me to
do good; be told me to disobey You and to disobey Your Messenger,
and he told me that I would not meet You. What.a bad brother, friend
and companion.194

3.6.6. Zuhr (asceticism) may be summed up
in two phrases from the Qur'an
'Ali (4)
said: Asceticism may be summed up in two phrases
from the noble Qur'an. Allah (s)
says: Bin order that you may not be
sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which
has been given to
(Qur'an 57: 23). The one who does not grieve

112

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

over the past or rejoice over what has been given to him has become
an ascetic in the complete sense of the word.19'

3.6.7. 'Ali (&) and his focus on prayer
'Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali explained that it is recommended for
the worshipper to ask Allah (&)for mercy if he recites a verse which
mentions mercy and to ask Allah for refuge from His punishment if
he recites a verse which speaks of punishment. It was narrated that
'Abd Khayr al-Hamdiui said: I heard 'Ali ibn Abi T a b recite in his
prayer, (Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,) (Qur'an 87:
I) and he said: S u b h Z m Rabbiy al-A'la (Glory he to my Lord Most
~ i ~ h ) . ' ~ ~
It was narrated that I;Iijr ibn Qays al-Madri said: I stayed
overnight with Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&). When
he was praying at night, I heard him reciting this verse: (Then tell Me
[about] the [human] semen that you emit. Is it you who create it [i.e.
make this semen into a perfect human being], or are We the Creator?B
(Qur'an 56: 58-59)He said three times: No, rather it is You, 0 Lord.
Then he recited: $Then tell Me about the seed that you sow in the
ground. Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?B (Qur'an
56: 63-64)He said three times: No, rather it is Yon, 0 Lord. Then he
recited: (Then tell Me about the water that you drink. Is it you who
cause it from the rain clouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it
to come down?) (Qur'an 56: 68-69).He said three times: No, rather it
is You, 0 Lord. Then he recited: ;(Then tell Me about the fire which
you kindle. Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the
Grower?) (Qur'an 56: 71-72). He said three times: No, rather it is You,

3.6.8. dl%e Day whereon neither wealth nor
sons will avail Except him who brings
to Allah a clean heart.) (Qur'an 26: 88-89)
'Ali (4)
said: Sons and wealth are the reward of this world,
and righteous deeds are the reward of the hereafter, and Allah (&)
may bestow both upon some people.198

4. 'Ali's staying close to the
Messenger of Allah (g)
'Ali was one of the MaMcans who were able to read and write
in an illiterate society, which is indicative of his love for knowledge
from an early age. Allah
enabled him to live from childhood in
the house of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) , so he was raised by him,
and the Prophet's care for him increased after he became Muslim.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
was the main influence that impacted
his character and enhanced his talents, purifying his heart,
enlightening his mind and reviving his soul. He stayed close to the
Messenger of Allah (8)
in MaMtah and in Madinah. He was keen to
study at the hands of the Messenger of Allah (g),
who educated his
Companions in knowledge of the noble Qur'an. He was the gushing
spring from which 'Ali (&) took his knowledge, education and
erudition. Verses were revealed to the Prophet (g)
in portions,
according to situations and events. He recited them to his
Companions, who learned their meanings and understood them in
depth, and who were influenced by their teachings. Thus they had a
profound impact on their minds, hearts and souls.

(s)

'Ali (&) was one of those who were influenced by the
Qur'anic education that they received from the Messenger of Allah
(B),absorbing its teachings and the teachings of the Prophet (g).

114

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

From the time he became Muslim, 'Ali (&) was very keen to
memorise, understand and ponder the Noble Qur'an. He stayed close
to the Messenger (g),
learning from him what was revealed to him,
until he had memorised all of its verses and chapters. Through the
blessing of keeping company with the Messenger of Allah (g)
and
being raised by him, 'Ali (&) attained a great deal of good, and he
became one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs later on. He was eager to
immerse himself in the wise guidance of the Prophet, in times of war
and peace. He acquired from the Messenger of Allah
howledge, education and understanding of the aims of this great
religion. There was great love between the Messenger of Allah (gJ
and 'Ali (&), and love is an important factor in preparing an
excellent academic atmosphere between teacher and student; it
produces good academic results. 'Ali (&) loved the Messenger of
Allah (g)very deeply. He was devoted to him and even offered
himself as a sacrifice for him in order to spread his message.

(s)

4.1. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) and
how he respected the status of prophethood
Allah (s)
enjoined upon the two races who were alive at the
time of the Prophet's mission - mankind and the jinn - that they
should believe in the Prophet (&) and the message he brought, as
attested by the text of the Qur'an. AUah
also confirmed the
obligation of believing in His Prophet by mentioning it alongside
belief in Him (&) in many places in the noble Qur'an, such as:

(s)

$Say [O Muhammad]: "0mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the
Messenger of Allah - to Whom belongs the dominion of the
heavens and the earth. Lci il6ha illa Huwa [none has the right to be
worshipped but He]. It is He Who gives life and causes death. So
believe in Allah and His Messenger Fluhammad], the Prophet who
can neither read nor write [i.e. Muhammad], who believes in Allah

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

115

and His Words [(this Qur'an), the Tawrit (Torah) and the Injeel
(Gospel) and also Allah's Word: "Be!" - and he was, i.e. 'Eesa
(Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)], and follow him so that you may be
guided.)
(Qur'an 7: 158)
The Prophet @J said: "By the One in Whose hand is the soul
of Muhammad, there is no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, who
hears of me then dies without believing in that with which I have
been sent, but he will be one of the dwellers of the fire."'99
The Ummah unanimously agrees that it is obligatory to believe
in the Prophet Maammad (s).
They also unanimously agree that
everyone - whether human or jinn - who does not believe in him,
after proof of his prophethood is established, is deserving of Allah's
punishment like those among the disbelievers to whom the
Messenger was sent. This is a basic principle on which the
Companions, those who followed them in trnth, the imams of the
Muslims and all the Muslim sects, Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah and
others, are all agreed.200
Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) showed due respect for the
position of prophethood and highlighted the importance of this
position in his words and deeds. He was keen to teach the people and
encourage them to follow the example of the Messenger of ALlah (@J
in word and deed and in all that he approved of. Among the words of
'Ali in this regard is his saying: Follow the guidance of your Prophet
(g),
for it is the best of guidance; follow his Sunnah, for it is the best
of ways.201

4.1.1. Obligation of obeying the Prophet (g)
and adhering to his Sunnah
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was raised to obey the
Messenger of Allah (g).
He was one of those who read, memorised

1 16

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib in Makkah

I

and understood the words of Allah: (He who obeys the Messenger
[Muhammad], has indeed obeyed AUah (s).)
(Qur'an 4: 80) This
verse is one of a number of verses that make a connection between
obeying Allah
and obeying the Messenger (g).
Allah has made
obedience to Him and obedience to His Messenger one and the same,
and the command to obey His Messenger is included in the command
to obey Him (&). This confirms to people that obedience to Him
cannot be achieved except by obedience to the Messenger
and
there are many verses that speak of this.''
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(4)
was raised by the Messenger of Allah (g),
and he learned from
him the importance of obeying him, heeding his commands,
following that which he brought, adhering to his Sunnah and taking
him as an example in aTI that he brought from his Lord. The advice of
the Prophet
concerning this matter gave the Ummah very
important guidelines. Whenever they followed it, adhered to it and
used it to light the way, then they achieved happiness in this world
and in the hereafter, and they prevailed and succeeded by Allah's
leave. The hadiths which speak of this are many, and they use a
variety of phrases and approaches; some of them contain likenesses
coined for his Ummah with regard
that the Messenger of Allah (g)
to this matter. No doubt these variations and different approaches
clarified the matter and highlighted its importance so that there was
no room left for anyone to misinterpret it or to change or distort the
meaning on the basis of whims and desires or conupt opinions.

(s)

(s),

(s)

These hadiths, although they vary in style, all emphasise one
and the same thing, which is confirming the obligation to obey him
(B).
They promise rewards for following that which he brought, in
addition to warning against and forbidding disobedience to him and
highlighting the severe punishment for that.'03 One of these hadiths
of the Prophet (g)
is: "All of my Ummah will enter paradise except
those who refuse." They said: 0 Messenger of AUah (g),
who

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

117

would refuse? He said: "The one who obeys me will enter paradise,
and the one who disobeys me has refused."204 Obedience to the
Messenger (g)
means following his Sunnah and rejecting the words
of anyone who says something about the religion of Allah ( B )that
goes against the Sunnah, without using trickery to justify
overlooking the Sunnah by means of flawed arguments and baseless
innovations.205
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was one of the keenest of the
Companions to obey the Messenger of Allah (g).
He (&) said: "I
would not forsake the Sunnah of the.Prophet (g)
for the opinion of
anyone."206He also said: "I am not a prophet, and I do not receive
revelation, but I act in accordance with the Book of Allah (%) and
the Sunnah of M&ammad (g)
as much as I can." This is a unique
example of adherence to the Sunnah and following and promoting
itzo7 It is on the basis of this understanding and clear vision of the
importance of obeying the Messenger (g)
and following his Sunnah
that the actions of Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) were based. He paid
a great deal of attention to the Sunnah and &ed to make sure that
what he narrated and what he followed of the Sunnah was sound and
correct. He (&) said: "If I narrate something to you from the
Messenger of Allah (g),
then to fall from heaven would be dearer to
me than to tell lies about him."z08 He also said: "If I heard a
Allah (&)benefited me
statement from the Messenger of Allah (g),
by it as much as He willed. If someone else told me of it, I would ask
him to swear (that he heard it from the Prophet), and if he swore, I
would believe him."209
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) fought any idea that was
contrary to the concept of following the Sunnah. He said: "If
religious matters were based on personal opinions, then it would be
more appropriate to wipe the bottom of the k h u f ~ "than
~ the top."

4.1.2. The r e p o r t of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (4)
about t h e signs of the
prophethood of the Messenger (,@)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
,.
explained some of the signs of
the prophethood of the Prophet ( g ) , including the following:
4.1.2.a. The blessing of his supplication
Once 'Ali (&) fell sick, and the Prophet (@) came to visit
him when he was saying: 0 Allah, if my time has come, then let me
die and rest, and if it has not yet come, then heal me, and if Yon want
to test me, then grant me patience. The Messenger of AUah (.@) said:
"What did you say?" He repeated it, and the Messenger of Allah ( g )
said: "0 Allah, heal him; 0 Allah, grant him wellbeing." Then he
said: "Get up." ['Ali] said: So I got up, and the pain never came back
to me again after that.''' We will discuss below the supplication of
the Messenger of Allah (g)
for him at Khaybar.
4.1.2.b. 'Ali's narration from the Prophet about
matters of the unseen that AUah revealed to hun
'Ali ibn Ahi T2ib (&) said: If I tell you something from the
Messenger of Allah (g),
to fall from heaven is dearer to me than to
tell a lie about him. But if I tell you about matters concerning me and
you, then war is deceit.212I heard the Messenger of Allah (@) say:
"At the end of time, there will come a people who are young in age
and foolish of mind, quoting what the best of creation (the Prophet)
said. They wiU pass out of Islam as the arrow passes through the prey.
Their faith will go no further than their throats. Wherever you find
them, kill them, for there is a reward on the Day of Resurrection for
the one who kills them."213 We will discuss this hadith and others
below when we discuss the Kharijites and Ali's attitude towards
them. inshallah.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

119

4.1.2.c. Fear instilled in the hearts of the enemy
One of the signs of prophethood that were narrated by 'Ali
(&) is this, which he narrated from the Messenger of Allah (gg):
"I
have been given that which was not given to any of the other
prophets." We said: 0 Messenger of Allah ( g ) , what is it? He said:
"I have been supported by means of fear instilled in the hearts of the
enemy, and I have been given the keys of the Earth, and I am called
Ahmad, and the soil has been made a means of purification for me,
and my Ummah has been made the best of nations."214

4.1.2.d. The Seal of Prophethood
'Ali (&) explained that among the attributes of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
were physical signs, and he described one of
the most prominent physical signs of his prophethood when he said:
Between his shoulders was the seal of prophethood.215This sign was
known to the People of the Book. It was an area of raised, red skin
near his left shoulder. At its smallest, it was the size of a pigeon's
egg, and at its largest, it was the size of a fist.'16
4.1.2.e. The mountains' greeting to the Prophet (g)
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) told us of this
sign when he said: I was with the Prophet (g)
in Makkah, and we
went out in some part of Makkah, and we did not come to any
mountain or tree but it said, "Peace be upon you, 0 Messenger of
Auah (g)."217

4.1.3. Encouraging people to adhere
to the way of the Prophet (gg)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
used to encourage the Muslims
to adhere to the guidance of the Prophet ( g ) . He said in a sermon that
he delivered in ar-~abdhah'l': "Adhere to your religion, follow the
guidance of your Prophet and follow his Sunnah. Whatever you do

120

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

not understand, try to find an answer in the Qur'an; whatever the
Qur'an approves of, adhere to it, and whatever it disapproves of,
reject it.""9 After Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Aliibn Abi T a b (&)came
back from fighting the Khaxijites, he delivered an eloquent speech to
his companions, encouraging goodness and prohibiting evil. In this
speech, he referred to the importance of adhering to the guidance of
the Prophet @), and he encouraged them to do that. He said:
"Follow the guidance of your Prophet (g),
for it is the best of
guidance. Follow his Sunnah, for it is the best of ways."220 The
internal strife that arose during his caliphate did not distract Amir dMu'mineen 'Ali (&) from calling his companions to all that is good,
forbidding them to do any evilzz1 and warning them against
innovations. Among the things that he said concerning that was:
"Serious matters are the best, and newly invented matters are the
worst. Every newly invented matter is an innovation, and everyone
who introduces something new is an innovator. The one who
innovates is misled, and no innovator introduces an innovation but he
has forsaken a ~ u n n a h . " ~ ~ ~

4.1.4. Explaining the virtues of the Prophet and
some of the rights that he has over his Ummal~
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib (+) explained the
virtues of the Prophet (g)
to the Muslims. Among the things that he
said in this regard was: "One of the ways in which Allah honoured
this Umrnah and singled them out for blessing is that He sent to them
Muhammad (&), who taught them the Book, wisdom, obligations
and the Sunnah so that they will he guided. He united them so that
they would not be divided, he cleansed them so that they would he
purified, and he made things easy for them so that they would not
transgress. When he had done all of that, Allah (%) took his soul.
Blessings, mercy and peace of Allah be upon him."223 The following
are some of the rights of the Prophet (B):

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

121

4.1.4.a. Speaking the truth w h e n narrating
from him a n d avoiding lying about him
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) warned against
telling lies about the Messenger of Allah (g).
It was narrated that
Rib'i ibn Harrssh said: I heard 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib say: The Prophet
(@) said: "Do not tell lies about me; the one who tells lies about me,
let him enter hell." Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&)
warned against knowingly transmitting lies. Among the things that
he narrated from the Prophet (g)
are the words: "Whoever narrates a
hadith from me, knowing that it is false, is one of the liars."224
4.1.4.b. Avoiding situations where people could
reject the hadith of the Prophet
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T a b (&) taught the people
to keep away from any situation which could result in rejection of the
hadith of Messenger of Allah (g),
such as telling the people things
that are beyond their understanding of the words of the Messenger of
He said: "Tell the people what they know; do yon want
Allah (g).
Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved?"225 What is meant by
what they know is that which they can understand. This is proof that
ambiguous issues of hadith should not be mentioned to the common
folk. Among those who disapproved of narrating some hadith hut not
others was Imam A M , with regard to badiths which appear to
encourage rebelling against those in authority; M2lik with regard to
haditbs about the divine attributes; and Abu Yoosuf with regard to
haditbs which speak about strange matters. The guidehe concerning
that is when the apparent meaning of a hadith may lend support to
innovation, but the apparent meaning is not what is meant. In this
case, what is required is to refiain from narrating the hadith to one
who, it is feared, will follow the apparent meaning.226

122

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

4.1.4.c. Thinking positively of the hadith
of the Messenger of AUah (g)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "If you are told a hadith
from the Messenger of Allah
then take it in the best, most
guided and most appropriate manner."227

(g),

4.1.4.d. Sending blessings upon him
Allah (&) says:
$Allah sends His Salih [Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy] on the
Prophet [Muhammad], and also His angels [ask Allah to bless and
forgive him]. 0 you who believe! end your Salih on [ask Allah to
bless] him Muhammad], and [you should] greet [salute] him with
the Islamic way of greeting [salutation, i.e. as-Salimu 'Alaykum].B
(Qur'an 33: 56)228
Here AUah is telling us of the status of His slave and Prophet among
the assembly on high: He praises him before the angels who are close
to Him, and the angels send blessings upon him. Then Allah ( B )
commands the inhabitants of the lower realm to send blessings and
peace upon him, so that praise will come to him from the inhabitants
of both realms, upper and lower.229Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi
Taib (&) confirmed this right of the Messenger of Allah (g)
by
describing the one who does not send blessings upon the Messenger
of Allah when he hears him mentioned as being stingy. He narrated
from the Messenger of Allah (s):
"The miser is the one in whose
presence I am mentioned, and he does not send blessings upon
me,n230

4.1.4.e. 'Ali's love for the Messenger of Allah &)
Allah (&) says: @Say: If your fathers, your sons, your
brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained,
the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which

'Ali ibn Abi T2lib

123

you deligbt are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and
striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allah brings
about His Decision [torment]. And Allah guides not the people who
are al-Fdsiqoon [the rebellious, disobedient to ~ l l a h ] )(Qur'an 9: 24).
This verse states that it is obligato~yto love Allah ( B )and His
Messenger, and that this love must be given precedence over all
other, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that among
the ~rnmah.'~'
Allah says: (Say [O Muhammad to mankind]: If you [really]
love Allah, then follow me [i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow
the Qur'an and the Sunnah], Allah will love you and forgive you your
sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (Qur'an 3: 31).
In this verse, there is an implicit indication that it is obligatory to love
the Prophet (g),
because Allah (&)has stated that the proof of love
for Him and sincerity thereof is following the Prophet (@). This
following cannot be achieved except after believing in the-prophet
@), and believing in him must fulfil the necessary conditions, one of
which is love for the Prophet (g).
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (&) that the Messenger of
Allah (gJsaid: "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of
you truly believe this until I am dearer to him than his son and his
father."z32 There can be no doubt that the level of the Companiorls'
love for him was more complete than that of anyone else, because
love is the fruit of knowledge and they were more aware of his
position, status and virtue than anyone else. Hence their love for him
(g)
was stronger and greater.z33Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi
T%b (&) was asked: "How was your love for the Messenger of
Allah (g)?"
He said: "He, by Allah, was dearer to us than our
wealth, our children, our fathers, our mothers and cold water when
one is thirsty."234 This type of absolute love is not for anyone but the
Messenger of Allah (g).

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib in Makkah

4.1.5. Deep and precise knowledge of the
characteristics of the Prophet's personality
Family ties helped in this regard, as did living close to him for
a long time and closely watching and observing the unique
characteristics and noble attitude and inclinations that Allah (&)
bestowed upon His Prophet. Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b
(&) had precise and detailed knowledge of the Prophet's character
and was able to describe it and point out its subtle aspects. That may
be seen below in what was narrated from him about the attitude,
behaviour and characteristics of the Messenger of Allah ($43.235
-.
4.1.5.a. Description of his physical characteristics

(4)

Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali
said: "The Messenger of Allah
(@) was not tall and not short; he had large hands and feet, and his
face had a reddish colour; he had a long and narrow line of hair from
his chest to his navel; he was of big build, and when he walked, he
leaned forward slightly as if he was walking
I have
never seen anyone Wce him before or since."z37
It was narrated from Muhammad ibn 'Ali that his father said:
'"he Messenger of Allah (g)
had a large head, large eyes and long
eyelashes."z38Hasan said: "He had a thick beard, areddish face and
large hands and feet. When he walked, he leaned forwards as if
climbing up, and when he turned, he turned with all his body (a sign
of courage)."239
At-Tirmidhi narrated that Muhammad, one of the sons of 'Ali
ibn Abi Taib (&) said: When 'Ali described the Prophet
he
said: "He was not very tall or very short; he was of average height.
His hair was neither very curly nor straight, and he was not fat or
fleshy in his face and cheeks, but there was some roundness in his
face. ~e was white mixed with some reddishness, with large hands
and feet. When he walked he moved energetically, as if walking
downhill, and when he turned, he turned with all his body."240

(s),

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

125

Moreover, 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (4)
described one physical
characteristic of the Prophet ( s ) after his death, something which no
one else knew, except maybe those who washed him after he died.241
He said: "I washed the Messenger of Allah ( g- ) , and I started looking
to see what I would expect in one who was deceased, but I did not see
anything. He looked good in life and in death, blessings and peace of
Allah be upon him.""'
'Ali (&) said while he was washing him:
"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, how good you look
in life and in death."243

4.1.5.b. Description of his attitude a n d character
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) spoke about the character of the
Prophet ( g ) , saying: "He was the most generous of people, the most
openhearted, the most sincere in speech, the most gentle and easygoing,m the kindest in dealing with others. Anyone who saw him for
the first time would be in awe of him, and whoever came to know
him would love him. One who described him said: I have never seen
anyone like him before or since."z45
He told us about the courage of the Messenger (g)
and his
toughness and strength. In spite of their great courage and strength
(which is recorded in the descriptions of the military expeditions of
the Prophet (g),
'Ali and those who were with him would turn to the
Messenger o h a h (g)
when the battle intensified. 'Ali (&) said:
"I remember the day of Badr and bow we drew close to the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) . He was the nearest of us to the enemy, and
he was one of the most courageous of the people that day."246
According to another report: "When the battle grew fierce and the
two sides met (on the battlefield), we sought the protection of the
Messenger of AUah (@), and no one would be nearer to the enemy
than him.n,247

Ali (&) described the character of the Messenger of Allah

(g)
as being merciful, generous, courageous and humble, as

126

'Ali ibn Abi T&b in Makkah

mentioned in his description of the Messenger of Allah (&) when the
Jews asked him about him: "He was the most merciful of people
towards people; to the orphan he was like a compassionate father,
and to widows he was generous and kind. He was thc bravest of
people and the most generous in giving, and he was the most
handsome in appearance. His gannent was a cloak, his food was
barley bread, his condiment was milk, his pillow was leather stuffed
with palm fibres, and his bed was made from a tree called umm
gheelan, covered with woven material."248 He had two turbans; one
was called ~ s - s a h c i band

~ other was called al-'iqib. His sword

bringing water, patch his garment and repair his shoes.254

4.1.6. Examples of 'AliEsfollowing the Sunnah
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was always eager to follow the
example of the Prophet (g),
and his life is the best indication of that.
The following are various examples showing that he did not
differentiate between major and minor issues in following the
Prophet.

- Supplication when mounting one's horse
It was narrated from 'Abdur-RazzQ: Someone who saw 'Ali
(&) when he rode told me: When he placed his foot in the s t h p , he
said: In the name of Allah. When he mounted, he said: "All praise be
to Allah, Who has placed this (transport) at our service; we ourselves
would not have been capable of that, and to our Lord is our final
destiny." Then he said Al-hamdu Lillih (praise be to Allah) three
times and Allihu akbar (Allah is most Great) three times, then he
said: "0 Allah, there is no god but You, Glory be to You. Verily I

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

127

have wronged myself, so forgive me, for surely no one can forgive
sins except You." Then he smiled, and he was asked: "Why are you
smiling, 0 Amir al-Mn'mineen?" He said: "I saw the Prophet (@) do
what I have done, and say what I have said, then he smiled. We said:
'Why are you smiling, 0 Prophet of Allah?' He said: 'I am amazed at
a slave of Allah when he says, "There is no god but You, I have
wronged myself, so forgive me, for no one forgives sins except
You," knowing that no one forgives sins except Him.,,,255

- Drinking while standing and while sitting
It was narrated from 'Ata' ibn al-SPib from Zadk that 'Ali
ibn Abi T a b (&) drank while standing, and the people were
looking at him as if they disapproved of that. He said: What are you
looking at? If I drink while standing, I saw the Prophet (SJdrink
while standing, and if I drink while sitting, I saw the Prophet (@)
drink while sitting.256

- Teaching the w u d o ~ of' ~the~ Messenger
~
of Allah (g)
It was narrated from 'Ahd Khayr: 'Ali taught us the wudoo' of
The slave poured water on his hands
the Messenger of Allah (gJ.
until he cleansed them, then he put his hand in the vessel and rinsed
his mouth and nose, and washed his face, three times for each; and he
washed his forearms up to the elbows, three times for each; then he
put his hand in the vessel and immersed it until his hand reached the
bottom, then he withdrew it and wiped his other hand with it; then he
wiped his head with his hands once; then he washed his feet up to the
ankles, three times for each; then he scooped up a handful of water
and drank it, then he said: 'This is how the Messenger of Allah (SJ
did ~ ~ d o o ' . " ~ ~ ~

- The Messenger of Allah&) forbade some things for 'Ali
It was narrated from Abdullah ihn Haneen that his father said: I
heard 'Ali ibn Abi Taib say: The Messenger of Allah (g)
forbade

128

'Ali ihn Ahi T a b in Makkah

me to wear a ring of gold, to wear al-qass (an Egyptian fabric with
some silk in it) and clothes dyed with safflower, and to recite Qur'an
while bowing. He gave me a suit made of a kind of silk, and I went
out wearing it. He said: "0 'Ali, I did not give it to you for you to
wear it." 'Ali said: So I took it back to FZCima, and gave her the edge
to hold. She held it, thinking to fold it up with me, but I tore it in two.
She said: May your hands be rubbed with dust, 0 son of Abi Tsib,
what have you done? I said to her: The Messenger of Allah (g)
forbade me to wear it; wear it and give it to your women to wear.z59

- Sins and forgiveness
It was narrated that 'Ali (&) said: The Messenger of Allah
(@) said: "If a person commits sin in this world and is punished for it,
Allah (&) is more just than to double the punishment for His slave,
and if a person commits a sin in this world and Allah (&)conceals it
and forgives him, Allah (B)
is more kind than to look again at
something that He has already forgiven."z60

- Obedience is only with regard to
what is right a n d proper
It was narrated from 'ALi (4)
that the Messenger of Allah
(@) sent out an army and appointed a man to command them. This
man lit a fire and told them to enter it. Some of them wanted to enter
it, but others said: 'We have fled from this @y becoming Muslim)."
The Messenger of Allah (gg)was told about this, and he said to those
who had wanted to enter the fire: "If you had entered it, you would
have stayed in it until the Day of Resurrection." And he said kind
words to the others, and he said: "There is no obedience if it involves
disobedience to Allah (g);
rather obedience is only in that which is
right and proper."261 This hadith shows us that obedience to rulers is
limited to obedience to Allah and His Messenger; absolute obedience
is not to he given to anyone except Allah and His Messenger (@).

- "Before one hundred years pass, the people

who are alive today will be gone"
Abu Mas'ood 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr d-AnsC entered upon 'Ali
ibn Abi Taib, and 'Ali (&) said to him: You are the one who says
"Before one hundred years have passed, the people who are alive
today will have gone." By Allah, the prosperity of this will come
after one hundred years.262

- The supplication of the Messenger (g)
for blessing for the people of Madinah
It was narrated from 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) that he said: We
went out with the Messenger of Allah
and when we were in alHarrah, at the water source belonging to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqzs, the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Bring the water for wudoo'." When
he had done wudoo', he stood up and turned to face the qiblah,263
then he said takbeer and said: "0 AUah, Ibriheem (@) was Your
slave and Your close friend, and he prayed for blessing for the people
of Makkah. I am Muhammad, Your slave and Your Messenger, and I
pray to You for the people of Madinah, that you might bless them in
their weights and measures as you blessed the people of Makkah,
with a twofold blessing."264

(s),

- Supplication at the time of distress
It was narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) said: The
Messenger of Allah
taught me to say when distress befalls me:
"Tbere is no God but AUah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous.
Glory be to AUah and blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Mighty
Throne, praise be to Allah the Lord of the
This hadith
shows us the necessity of attaching one's heart to Allah (&) alone
and depending on Him and turning to Him. No one can grant relief
except Him ( B ) and
, no one answers the prayer of one who is in
desperate need when be calls upon Him except the One Who created

(s)

130

'Ali ibn Abi T a b in M a k h

him. There is no refuge except with Him. In this hadith, there is
guidance and instruction for every Muslim to depend upon Allah
( B )in all his affairs.
- "He did not say anything that w a s only for me,
which w a s concealed from the public"

It was narrated that Abu at-Tufayl said: We said to 'Ali: Tell us
something that the Messenger of Allah (gJsaid only to you. He said:
He did not say anything that was only for me, which was concealed
from the public, but I heard him say: "May Allah curse the one who
offers a sacrifice to anything other than Allah. May Allah curse the
one who gives refuge to an innovator. May Allah curse the one who
curses his parents. May Allah curse the one who changes the
boundary markers."
He said "May Allah curse," and the curse of
Allah means being cast far away from the mercy of Allah. The words
"the one who offers a sacrifice to anything other than Allah" includes
everyone and everything other than Allah, if the sacrifice is offered to
a Prophet, an angel, a jinn or anyone else. If these matters were not
serious according to the religion of Allah (g),
they would not have
reached such a level that the one who does them deserves to be
cursed by Allah

(s).

- Allah is kind a n d loves kindness
It was narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) said: The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Allah is kind and loves kindness, and
He gives in return for kindness that which He does not give in return
for harshness."267

- Giving z a G h before it is due
It was narrated from 'Ali (&) that al-'Ahhh ihn 'AbdnlMuWb asked the Prophet (g)
about paying zakih before it is due,
and he granted him a concession allowing that.268

- The last ten days of Ramadan

It was narrated that 'Ali ibu Abi Tilib (&) said: The
Messenger of AUah (g)
used to wake his family up (for night
prayers) during the last ten days (of Ramadan), and he would tighten
his waist wrapper (meaning that he strove hard).

4.2. People who narrated from
'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)
Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&)
, . was the most knowledgeable of
the Companions of his time about the Sunnah. It was narrated that
'Ali (&) was mentioned in the presence of 'A'ishah (@), and she
said: He is the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah among those who
are left.z69 Yet he narrated from the Prophet (g)
586 hadithsZ7O,
which is fewer than some of the other Companions (may AUah be
pleased with them). That was for a number of reasons, including the
following:

(i) His being preoccupied with judiciary matters, rulership
and war, which meant that he did not have time to issue
fatwas or hold study circles, which were the main ways
that the knowledge of some of the Companions, such as
Abdullah ibn Mas'ood and Abdullah ibn 'Abb%,
becoming widespread.
(ii) The emergence of people of whims and desires and
followers of innovation, who exaggerated about him, and
others who thought little of him, led to many lies being
told about him.Hence the scholars did their utmost to
check the soundness of the chains of narration that went
back to him.
(iii) The great extent of turmoil at this time, and the fact that
some people were distracted by that, meant that he did not

132

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

trust anyone to pass on his knowledge. It was narrated that
he said: I have knowledge, and would that I could find
people to learn it from me and convey it to 0thers.2~'
With regard to 'Ali's methods of narrating and accepting
hadiths, we may note the following:

4.2.1. Caution against telling lies
about the Prophet (g)
'Ali was one of those who narrated the words of the Prophet
(g):
"Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place
in he^.""^

4.2.2. Double-checking the
authenticity of the narration
As mentioned previously, 'Ali (&) would ask the narrator to
swear that it was true. It is narrated that he said: If I heard a hadith
I would benefit from it as much
from the Messenger of Allah (g),
AUab (&) willed, and if someone else told me a hadith from the
Messenger of AUah (gig),I would ask him to swear to it, and if he
swore to it I would believe

4.2.3. Not narrating munkar (odd) hadith
It was narrated that he said: Tell the people what they can
recognise and accept, and keep away from that which they find odd
or objectionable. Do yon want Allah (&)and His Messenger to be
di~believed?"~'Ali narrated from Abu Bakr, 'Umar, al-Miqdsd ibn
al-Aswad and his wife F2Gmah (may Allah be pleased with them all).

family narrated from 'Ali (&) Among the most famous of the

5. The most important exploits of
'Ali ibn Abi Tslib (&) between
the migration to Madinah and
the Battle of the ~ r e n c h ~ ' ~
After he settled in Madinah, the Messenger of Allah ( g )
began to lay the foundations of the Islamic state. He created bonds of
brotherhood between the ~ u h i j i r e e n
and
~ ~the
~ An$%, then he built
the mosque, drew up the covenant with the Jews, began to launch
expeditions and focused on establishing the economic and
educational aspects of the new society. 'Ali was close by his side in
d l his affairs, carrying out his orders and learning from his guidance.

5.1. Expeditions
As soon as the Muslims settled under the leadership of the
in Madinah, the expeditions began. They were aimed
Messenger (g)
at establishing the authority of the state both inwardly and outwardly,
winning over some of the tribes, containing the Bedouins and
training the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in
making milim preparations for larger campaigns. The conquest
movement was a field for the praciical training- of leaders. Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) took part in these expeditions, which occurred
both before and after the battle of Badr. As for those in which he took
part before Badr, they include:

5.1.1. ~ h a z w a t ~al-'~sheerah~'~
'~
In this campaign, the Prophet ( g ) aimed to attack Quraysh,
and he appointed Abu Salamah ibn 'Abdul-Asad in charge of
Madinah during his absence. This campaign was called Ghazwat d 'Asheerah, after the place in which the Prophet (g)stayed for the

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

141

month of Jum2da al-Oola and for a few days in the mouth of Jum%ia
a l - a r a h . He made a peace deal with Banu Madlaj and their allies
from Banu Damrah, then he returned to Madinah. No fighting took
place, because the loaded camels that he went to intercept had already
passed by a few days before on their way to syria309, following the
coastal route. When news of that reached Quraysh, they set out to
prevent it happening; they met the Messenger of Allah (g),
and the
Battle of Badr took place.310 'Am21 ihn YLir told of his and 'Ali's
participation in that campaign; it was narrated that he said: 'Aliand I
were companions during the campaign of DhulL'Asheerah. When we
reached there, the Messenger of Allah (g)
made camp, and we saw
some people from Banu Madlaj working at a spring of theirs among
some palm trees. 'Ali said to me: 0 Abu al-Yaqzk, shall we go to
these people and see what they are doing? So we went to them and
watched what they were doing for a while, then we felt sleepy, so 'Ali
and I went and lay down under a group of palm trees, on the bare
ground, and fell asleep. By Allah (B),
we did not feel anything until
the Messenger of Allah (@)
.-nudged us with his foot. We had gotten
dusty on that hare ground, and it was on that day that the Messenger
of Allah (@) said to 'Ali: Ya Ahu Turzb ( 0 Father of Dust), because
of the dust that he saw on him. He said: "Shall I not tell you of the
two most doomed of people?" We said: Yes, 0 Messenger of Allah
(g).
He said: "The reddish man of Thamood who hamstrung the shecamel and the man who strikes you, 0 'Ali, on this [meaning on the
front of the head] until this [meaniug his beard] becomes wet with
blood."311 The Messenger of Allah (gJ
called 'Aliby this name Abu
Tur2h again, as we shall see.pelow.

5.1.2. The first campaign to Badr
The cause of this campaign was that Karaz ihn Jiibbir al-Fihri
had raided and captured some grazing camels and flocks of Madinah.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
went out after him until he reached a

142

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in MaWiah

valley called Safwk, in the direction of Badr. Karaz ibn J2bir got
away, and the Messenger of Allah (g)
could not catch up with him,
so he returned to adi in ah."^ The Prophet (g)
gave his white banner
to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (L&).~"
These missions and campaigns that the Messenger of Allah
(g)
fought against the polytheists are regarded as the beginning of
fighting jihad against the enemies of Islam. With the onset of these
expeditions, it became clear that the Prophet (g)
and his
Companions, including Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&),
were acting in accordance with the natural law of checking one set of
people by means of another. This natural law is strongly connected to
the support of this religion, and Allah refers to it in His noble Book:
h d if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another,
the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty
to the 'iilameen [mankind, jinn and all that exists].$ (Qur'an 2: 251)
dThose who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only
because they said: 'Our Lord is Allah.' For had it not been that AUah
checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches,
synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name of AUah is mentioned
much would surely have been pulled down. Verily, Allah will help
those who help His [Cause]. Truly, Allah is Al-Strong, All-Mighty.)
(Qur'an 22: 40)

5.2. The Battle of Badr
5.2.1. Ali's presence at Badr
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "The
historians are agreed that 'Ali was present at Badr and all the major
events except Tabook. They said: The Prophet (g)gave him the
banner on many occasions."314

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

143

'Ali ibn Ahi T%b was one of the rnujcihideen3" who took part
in the battle of Badr, so let him tell us the story of this battle. It was
narrated that Hkithah ibn Mudarrib narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
(&) said: "The Prophet was trying to find out what was happening
around Badr. When we heard that the polytheists had come, the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) marched to Badr, which was a well. The
polytheists got there before us, and we found two of their men there, a
man from Quraysh and a freed slave of 'Uqbah ibn Abi Ma'eet. The
Qurayshi man fled, but we captured the freed slave of 'Uqbah, and
we asked him: 'How many people are there?' He said: 'By AUah,
they are many, and they are very strong.' When he said that, the
Muslims beat him and took him to the Prophet (@), who said to him:
'How many people are there? He said: 'By Allah, they are many,
and they are very strong.' The Prophet ( g ) tried hard to make him
tell him exactly how many they were, but he refused. Then the
Prophet (g)
asked him: 'How many camels do they slaughter every
day? He said: 'Ten a day.' The Messenger of AUah ( s ) said: 'They
are one thousand, each camel for one hundred and some.'
"That night it rained, and we sheltered beneath trees and
shields from the rain. The Messenger of Allah ( s ) spent the night
calling upon his Lord, saying: 'If Yon cause this band to be
destroyed, You will not be worshipped.' When he came out, he called
out: 'Prayer, 0 slaves of AUah.' The people came from beneath the
trees and shields, and the Messenger of Allah (g)
led us in prayer
and urged us to fight. Then he said: 'Quraysh have gathered beneath
this red side of the mountain.' When the people drew close to us, and
we formed ranks and they formed ranks, we saw a man among them
on a red camel of his, going among the people. The Messenger of
Allah (g)
said: '0 'Mi, call Hamzah.' He was closest to the
polytheists (and would be able to tell) who the man on the red camel
was and what was he saying to them. Then the Messenger of Allah

144

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Ma&h

(g)
said: 'If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining
good, it may be the man on the red camel.' Hamzah came and said:
'He is 'Utbah ibn Rabee'ah; he is telling them not to fight, and he is
saying to them: 0 people, I see people who are prepared to die; you
will never be able to harm them and stay safe. 0 people, go back and
put the blame on me today, and say that 'Utbah is the coward,
although you know that I am no coward.' Abu Jahl heard that and
said: 'Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else were to say this, I
would punish him. Your heart is filled with fear.' 'Utbah said: 'Are
you accusing me of cowardice, 0 you who break wind out of €ear?
You will find out today which of us is the coward.' 'Utbah went forth
scornfully with his brother Shaybah and his son al-Waleed, and they
said: 'Who will come out for a duel?' Six young men of the Ansir
went forth, but 'Utbah said: 'We do not want these; send out to us our
cousins from Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib.' The Messenger of Allah (B)
said: 'Get up 0 'Ali; get up 0 Hamzah; get up 0 'Ubaydah ibn alH%th ibn al-Mutwb.' Allah
caused 'Utbah and Shaybah, the
sons of Rabee'ah, and al-Waleed ibn 'Utbah to be killed, and
'Ubaydah was wounded.

(s)

"We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. Then a short
man from among the An& brought al-'Abb% ibn 'Abdul-Mugalib
as a prisoner. AlLCAbb2ssaid: '0 Messenger of Allah, by Allah this
man did not capture me; rather I was captured by a bald man with the
most handsome face, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see
him among the people.' The Anv2ri said: 'I did capture him, 0
Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Be quiet; Allah supported you with a
noble angel.' 'Ali said: From among Banu 'Abdul-Mutab we
captured al-'Abbgs, 'Aqeel and Nawfal ibn a l - ~ % i t h . " ~ From
~~

pleased with her and make her pleased.319

5.3.1. Her dowry and trousseau
'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&,) said: "Proposals were made to the
Messenger of Allah (g)
for Fitimah. A freed slave woman of mine
said: 'Do yon know that offers are being made to the Messenger of
Allah (g)
for Etimah?' I said: 'No.' She said: 'Offers have been
made. What is preventing you from going to the Messenger of Allah
(g)
so that he might give her to you in marriage?' I said: 'Do I have
anything with which to get manied?' She said: 'If you go to the
Messenger of Allah (g),
he will accept your proposal.' By Allah, she
kept encouraging me until I entered upon the Messenger of Allah
(g).
When I sat before him, I could not speak, out of awe and
respect. The Messenger of Allah (g)
.. said: 'What brings you here?

146

'Ali ibn Abi Ttilib in Makkah

Do you need something?' I remained silent, then he said: 'Perhaps
you have come to propose to Fgtimah?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Do
you have anything to give as a mahr?' I said: 'No, by Allah, 0
Messenger of AUah.' He said: 'What did you do with the shield I
gave you? By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it is worth four
hundred dirhams.' I said: 'I have it.' He said: 'I give her to yon in
marriage; send it to her and that will be her dow~y.'So it became the
mahr of F g W , the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (&)."320
The r e p o a of the Shia say: "She took my shield and went to
the market with it and sold it for four hundred dirhams to 'Uthmh
ibn 'Affk. When she took the money from him, and he took the
shield from me, he said: '0 Abu al-Hasan, am I not more entitled to the
shield than you, and aren't you more entitled to the money than me?' I
said: 'Yes.' He said: 'This shield is a gift from me to you.' I took the
shield and the money and went to the Messenger of Allah (gJ,
and
placed the shield and the money before him, and told him what had
happened with 'Uthmk, and the Prophet (g)
prayed for him."321
The Messenger of Allah (@) gave Fitimah (I&) a trousseau of
a velvet garment, a waterskin and a pillow of leather stuffed with
grass.322

5.3.2. Her wedding
Asma' bint 'Umays said: "I was at the wedding of Fgtirnah, the
daughter of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) . The next day, the Prophet
(g)
came to the door and said: '0 &n Ayman, call my brother
(meaning 'Ali) for me.' She said: 'He is your brother and you gave
him your daughter in marriage?' He said: 'Yes, 0 Umm Ayman.' She
said: 'Ali came and the Prophet ( g ) sprinkled water on him and
prayed for him. Then he said: ' ~ a l f ~ 2forWme.' She said: She
came stumbling because of shyness, and the Messenger of Allah (@J
said to her: 'Calm down; I have given you in marriage to the dearest

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

147

of my household to me.' The Prophet (g)
also sprinkled water on her
and prayed for her. Then the Messenger of Allah (g)
went hack, and
he saw a black shape ahead of him. He said: 'Who is this?' I said:
'Me.' He said: 'Asma'?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Asma' hint
'Umays?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Did you come to the wedding of the
daughter of the Messenger of Allah (g)
to honour him?' I said:
'Yes.' Then he prayed for me."323

5.3.3. The wedding feast
It was narrated that Buraydah said: When 'Ali proposed to
Fgtimah, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'There has to be a feast
for the wedding." Sa'd said: I will provide a ram. Several of the
An& collected a number of measures of barley for him. When the
wedding night came, the Prophet (gg)said: 0 'Ali, do not do
anything until you meet me. The Prophet (g)
called for water and
performed wudoo' with it, then he poured it on 'Ali and said: "0
Allah, bless them and bestow blessings upon them and bless their
offspring."324

5.3.4. The lifestyle of 'Ali and FSwah
(may Allah be pleased with them)
The lifestyle of 'Ali and Fiitimah, who were the dearest of
people to the Messenger of Allah (g),
was an ascetic lifestyle in
which they lived on very little; it was a life of patience and striving.
Hanid nanated from 'Am': I was told that 'Alisaid: "We stayed for
several days during which we had nothing and the Prophet (@J
- had
nothing. I went out, and I found a dinar lying on the road. I paused for
a while, thinking whether to take it or leave it, then I took it because
of the hardship we were facing. I bought some flour with it, then I
brought it to Fitimah and said: Make dough and bread. She staaed to
make dough, and she was so tired that she leaned forward and could

148

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

not keep her lock of hair from touching the dough. Then she baked
bread, and I went to the Prophet (g)
and told him. He said: 'Eat, for
it is provision that AUah (&) has granted to you."'325
It was narrated that ash-Shi'hi said: 'Ali (&) said: "I married
F%~imah,
the daughter of Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (g),
and she and I had no furnishings apart from the skin of a ram on
which we slept at night, and on which we carried food to our camel
during the day, and I had no servant apart from her."326
It was narrated from M u j a d that 'Ali (&) said: "I got very
hungry in Madinah, and I went out looking for work in the outskirts
of the city. There was a woman who had gathered some dirt, and I
thought she wanted to wet it, so I went to her and made an agreement
with her (that she would give me) one date for each bucket. I brought
sixteen buckets, until my hands swelled up, then I brought the water
and drank some of it. I put my hands like this in front of her hands,
and she counted out sixteen dates for me. Then I came to the Prophet
(g)
and told him, and he ate some of them with me."327This report
shows us the hardship that Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Mi (&) went
through in Madinah, and from it we may leam the proper conduct in
dealing with hardship, as 'Ali (&) went out and worked with his
own hands to earn in the proper way, and he did not sit and wait for
whatever people felt like giving. Another thing we learn is the
strength of the patience with which he undertook that hard work
when he was suffering severe hunger which had sapped his strength.
We also leam about giving precedence to loved ones and showing
loyalty to them, because despite his extreme hunger and the hard
work he had done, he kept his wages of dates until he met the Prophet
(g)
and ate with him.328

5.3.5. Asceticism and patience of
asSayyidah Fstimah ($,)
Her life was very simple and uncomplicated; it was closer to a
life of hardship than alife of
The following story shows us
F2cimah's situation of hardship and exhaustion, and the attitude of
the Messenger of Allah ( g ) when she asked him to give her a servant
from among the prisoners of war. 'Ali said to Fi(imah one day: "By
Allah, I have brought water until I felt a pain in my chest." He said:
"Some captives have been brought to your father; go and ask him for
a servant." She said: "And I, by Allah, have ground flour until my
hands became sore." So she went to the Prophet ( g ) , and he said:
"What brings you here, 0 my daughter?" She said: "I have come to
greet you"; she felt too shy to ask him, so she went hack. 'Ali said:
"What happened?" She said: "I felt too shy to ask him." So they
went together, and 'Ali said: "0 Messenger of Allah (g),
by Allah
(%) I have brought water until I started to feel pain in my chest."
And F2cimah said: "I have ground flour until my hands h ~ r t . ~ ~ ~ ~ l l a h
has brought you plenty of captives, so give us a servant." The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "By Allah, I will not give it to you and
leave ah1 a s - s ~ f f a h ~starving
~'
when I have nothing to spend on
them. Rather I will sell them (the captives) and spend the price on ah1
as-suffah." So they went hack. Then the Prophet (g)
came, when
they were under the cover which, if it covered their heads, it left their
feet hare, and if it covered their feet, it left their heads hare. They
wanted to get up, hut he said: "Stay where you are." He said: "Shall I
not tell you of something that is better than what you asked for?"
They said: "Yes." He said: "(It is) words that Jibreel (peace be upon
him) taught me." He said: "Following every prayer, glorify Allah ten
times, praise Him ten times and magnify Him ten times. When you
go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty-three times, praise Him thirtythree times and magnify Him thirty-four times."33z

150

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib in Makkah

We learn several important values from this story:

(a)

This incident shows us how the Prophet
handled the economic
crisis through which his state in Madinah passed, by putting his
priorities in order. Spending on ahl q-suffah in order to alleviate
their hunger was a necessity. As for 'Ali and Fitimah's need for a
servant, it was not as important as the need of ahl q-suffah, so the
Messenger of Allah (g)
gave priority to ah1 q-suffah over them. The
Prophet's means of solving the economic crisis were many.
'Ali (&) was influenced by this Prophetic training, and with
the passage of time, he became the caliph of the Muslims. As a result
of the Prophet's training, we see him putting himself above worldly
gains and adornment although the treasures of the earth were in his
hands, because remembrance of Allah (&) filled his heart and
overshadowed his existence. He kept doing what the Messenger of
Allah
had recommended, as he himself told us when he said: By
Allah, I never omitted them since he taught me them. One of the
Companions asked him: Not even on the night of Siffeen? He said:
Not even on the night of ~ i f f e e n . ~ ~ ~

(s)

5.3.6. "Our souls are in the hand of Allah,
and when He wills, He could wake us from sleep"
It was narrated that 'Ali ihn Ahi Tilib (4)
said: "The
Messenger of Allah (@Jentered upon me and Fitimah one night and
woke us up to pray. He went hack to his house and prayed for a
while, hut he did not hear any sound from us, so he came hack to us
and woke us up and said: 'Get up and pray.' I sat up, mbbing my
eyes, and said: 'By Allah, we will not pray anything hut that which
has been decreed for us. Our souls are in the hand of Allah, and when
He wills, He could wake us from sleep.' The Messenger of Allah (gJ
turned away, striking his thigh with his hand and saying: 'We will not
pray anything hut that which has been decreed for us, we will not

'Ali ihn Abi Trilib

151

pray anything but that which has been decreed for us. (But, man is
ever more quarrelsome than anything.B (Qur'an 18: 54)"' The fact
that 'Ali (&) related this story shows how sincere he was towards
the truth and how keen he was spread knowledge even though (the
rebuke) had to do with him. This is an important value which the
Muslims can learn from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), because if he
had wanted to, he could have concealed the hadith, knowing that the
night prayers (qiycim al-layo are not obligatory.

5.4. Her two sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn
(may Allah be pleased with them)
5.4.1. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib al-Hiishimi
He was the grandson of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the
apple of his eye in this world, one of the two masters of the youth of
the people of paradise. His mother was FiiGmah az-Zahra'. He was
born in the middle of Ramadan 3 AH, or it was said in the month of
Sha'bin, or in 4 or 5 AH.^^^ He died in 50 AH. In my book as-Seerah
an-Nabawiyyah, I favoured the view that he was born in the fourth
year after the hijrah.335

(B)

The Messenger of AUah
named him Hasan. 'Ali said:
"When al-Hasan was born, I named him Harb. The Messenger of
AUah (g)
came and said: 'Show me my son. What have you named
him?' I said: 'Harb.' He @) said: 'No, rather he is asa an."'^^^ Thus
he (g)
changed that harsh name337to a beautiful name338that instils
joy and happiness in the heart. So the newborn was given a beautiful
name, and the Prophet (g)
held him in his arms and kissed him.
Abu R%' tells us about the actions of the Messenger of Allah
(g):
"I saw the Prophet (g)
saying the words of the call to prayer in
the ears of al-Hasan after F&nah gave birth to him.'3339

152

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

Abu RZ' also tells us of the 'aqeeqah of al-Hasan. He said:
"When FZCimah gave birth to al-Hasan, she said: 'Shouldn't I offer
two rams as 'aqeeqah on behalf of my son?' The Prophet (&)said:
'No. Rather shave his head and give the weight of his hair in silver to
the poor and al-awEd."' Al-awEd were some of the Companions of
the Messenger of Allah (g)
who were in need, in the mosque or at
as-suffah. So she did that.340
There are many hadiths that speak of the virtues of al-Hasan
ibn 'Ali, including the following:
(a) It was narrated that al-Bara' ibn 'Azih (&) said: "I saw alHasan ibn 'Ali on the shoulder of the Prophet (g),
who was
saying: '0 Allah, I love him, so love him."'341
@) It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (&) that the Prophet (g)

said of al-Hasan: "0 Allah, I love him, so love him and love
those who love him."342
(c) It was narrated from U s h a h ihn Zayd (&) that the Prophet
held him [ U s h a h ] and al-Hasan and said: "0 AUah, I love them
so love them."343
(d) It was narrated that Abu Bakrah (&) said: I heard the Prophet
(B)on the minbar, with al-Hasan beside him, looking from the
people to him, saying: "This son of mine is a leader, and perhaps
Allah (g)
will bring about reconciliation by means of him
between two groups of ~ u s l i m s . "The
~ ~fact
~ that the Prophet
(g)
described al-Hasan as a leader was a great honour for him
(may Allah be pleased with him and make him pleased), and the
prophecy of his grandfather (g)
was fulfilled. At his hand, the
Muslims were reconciled, and bloodshed was prevented, when
he gave up his right of caliphate to Mu'Zwiyah (may Allah he
pleased with them all). That occurred in 41 AH. His caliphate
lasted six months, and that was called the year of unity. This is

153

what the Prophet (g)
foretold when he said, "Perhaps Allah will
bring about reconciliation by means of him between two great

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

Ihn Hajar said: "In this hadith, we see one of the signs of
prophethood and a great virtne of d-Hasan ibn 'Ah, because he
gave up power, not because of a lack of support or weakness on
his part or any fault of his; rather it was because of his desire to
attain the reward that is with Allah, because of what he sought of
preventing shedding of Muslim blood. So he paid attention to
the interests of the faith and of the ~ m m a h . We
" ~ will
~ ~ discuss
al-Hasan's yielding the caliphate to Mu'iwiyah when we discuss
his era in a separate book inshallah.
(e) It was narrated that Sa'eed a l - ~ a ~ b ' isaid:
r i ~ "We
~ ~ were with
Abu Hurayrah (A),and al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib came
to us and greeted us. We returned the greeting to him, but Ahu
Hurayrah did not hear him. We said: '0 Abu Hurayrah, this is d Hasan ibn 'Ali who has greeted us.' He ran after him and said:
'Upon you be peace, 0 my master.' Then he said: 'He is a
master."'348
(f) He resembled the Prophet (g)
physically. Bukhari narrated with
his chain of narration going back to Anas ibn Milik (&) that he

said: "No one resembled the Prophet (g)
more than al-Hasan
ibn ' ~ l i . " ~ ~ ~
(g) He also narrated with his chain of narration going back to 'Uqbah
ibn al-H%ith that he said: "I saw Abu Bakr canying al-Hasan and
saying: 'May my father be sacrificed for the one who looks like
the Prophet and not like 'Ali,' and 'Ali smiled."350 The fact that
he resembled his grandfather (@) physically is a great virtue and
obvious blessing for him.351

154

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in MaWiah

5.4.2. al-Husayn ibn 'Ali (&)
Abu Abdullah al-Husayn ibn 'Ali ibn Abi T%b, the grandson
of the Messenger of Allah (s),
the apple of his eye and his beloved.
He was the son of the daughter of the Messenger of AUah (g),
F&nah (%). He was born in 4 AH, although there are other
opinions, a& he (&) died as a martyr on the day of 'Ashoora' in the
month of Muharram 61 AH, in Karbala' in Iraq. May Allah be
pleased with him and make him pleased.352 Many hadiths were
narrated concerning his virtues, including the following:
(a) &mad narrated with his chain of narration going back to Ya'la
al-'Amiri (&)
. . that he went out with the Messenger of Allah
(gj)to a meal to which they were invited. He said: "The
Messenger of Allah (@) came in front of the people, and alHusayn was playing with some boys. The Messenger of Allah
(g)
wanted to pick him up, but the boys started rnnning here
and there, and he and the Prophet (g)
were both laughing until
he caught hold of him. Then he put one of his hands on the back
of his head and the other beneath his chin, and he kissed him and
said: 'Husayn is of me, and I am of Husayn. 0 Allah, love
whoever loves Husayn; Husayn is one of my grandsons."'353
This shows the clear virtue of al-Hnsayn (&), since the Prophet
urged that he should be loved, as if hehad prior knowledge
by means of revelation of what would happen between him and
the people, so he mentioned him in particular and affirmed the
obligation of loving him, and forbade harming him or fighting
him. This is confirmed by his words, "May Allah love those who
love Husayn," because loving him leads to loving the
Messenger, and loving the Messenger (g)
is part of loving
Allah (&).354

a)

@) Bukhai narrated with his chain of narration going back to Anas
ibn Maik (&) that he said: "The head of al-Husayn (peace be

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

155

upon him) was brought to 'Ubaydullah ibn ~ i ~ and
2 placed
d ~
on a platter. He started hitting the ground with a stick and saying
how handsome he was." Anas said: "He was the one who most
resembled the Messenger of Allah
and his hair was dyed
with w a ~ i r n a h . " ~ ~ ~

(s),

(c) According to another report from Anas: "When the head of alHusayn was brought to 'Ubaydullah ibn Z i y a , he started
touching the teeth with a stick. He (the narrator) said: 'I think he
said that he was handsome.' I (Anas) said: 'I shall annoy you. I
saw the Messenger of AUah (g)
kissing what you are t o u c h g
with your stick.' So he stopped doing it."357 These two hadiths
point to the virtue of al-Husayn (&) and show that he most
resembled the Prophet among Ahl al-Bayt. But there may be
some problem with that suggestion, especially in light of what
we have quoted above concerning the virtues of al-Hasan, which
say that no one resembled the Messenger of Allah (g)
more
closely than al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, which would imply a conflict
between the reports. This confusion was dispelled by Ibn Hajar
(may Allah have mercy on him); he reconciled the reports by
saying: "These reports may be reconciled by noting that what
Anas said, according to the report of az-Zuhri, was spoken when
al-Hasan was still alive, because at that time he was the one who
resembled the Prophet (g)
more closely than his brother alHusayn. As for what is mentioned in the report of Ibn Sireen,
that took place after that (after al-Hasan had died), as is clear
from the context; or else what may be meant is that al-Husayn
resembled him more closely than anyone apart from al-Hasan.
Or it may be that each of them resembled him more closely in
some features. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn IJibbih narrated from H k i '
ibn Hihi from 'Ali that be said: 'al-Hasan resembled the Prophet
(B)from head to navel, and al-Husayn resembled the Prophet
(g)
from the navel downwards.,93358 These are some of the

hadiths narrated concerning al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased
with him and m&e him pleased).

5.4.3. Hadiths which mention virtues
shared by al-Hasan and al-Husayn
(may Allah be pleased with them)
(a) Bukhari narrated with his chain of narration going back to Ibn
'Umar that a man from Iraq asked him about the pilgrim in Wam
killing flies. He (&) said: "The people of Iraq are asking about
flies when they killed the son of the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah (@), and the Prophet ( g ) said: 'They are my two sweet
smelling flowers in this
Ibn Hajar said: "What is
meant is: they are among that with which Allah (&) has
honoured me and blessed me, because children are to be smelled
and kissed as if they are fragrant plants."3"
(b) It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (&) said: "The Messenger of
Allah ( g ) said: 'Whoever loves them loves me, and whoever
hates them hates me,"' meaning d-Hasan and a l - ~ u s a ~ n . ~ ~ '
(c) It was narrated from al-Bara' ibn ' L i b (&) that the Messenger
of Allah ( g ) saw Hasan and Husayn and said: ''0 Allah, I love
them, so love them."362
(d) It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
.. said: "Al-Hasan and al-Husayn are the
masters of the youth of paradise."363
(e) It was narrated that Abdullah ibn Buraydah said: I heard Abu
was addressing us,
Hurayrah say: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
and d-Hasan and al-Husayn came, wearing red shirts, walking
and stumbling. The Messenger of Allah ( g ) came down from
the minbar, picked them up and put them in front of him; then he
said: 'Allah ( B )and His Messenger speak the trnth: dYour

these two children walking and stumbling, and I couldn't help
but stop my talk and pick them
(f) It was narrated from Sa'eed ibn Jubayr from Ibn 'Abbh (may
Allah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allah
used to pray for refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, saying: "I
seek refuge for you in the perfect words of Allah (&) from every
devil and every vermin [hhmmah], and from every bad eye. This
is how Ibr2heem used to pray for refuge for Isma'eel and
This hadith does not contradict that which was

narrated by Abu Hurayrah (&), that the Messenger of Allah

said, "la hhm, la hrim,"368 and his words, "There is no
'adw2 (contagion, transmission of infectious disease without the
permission of AUah), no Safar (the month of Safar was regarded
as "unlucky" during the jailiyyah) and no h b a h . " 3 6 9 Abu
Ja'far at-Tahhgwi responded by saying: These hadiths state that
there is no h b a h and that it does not exist, so how can it be
possible to seek refuge for them from something that does not
exist? Our response to him, with the help of Allah (@), is that
the h&nmah from which the Prophet (g)
sought refuge for them
was hawiim al-ard or the vermin of the earth from which harm is
feared; the h h m a h which he stated does not exist is something
different; it was something that the Arabs believed in with regard
to death?70 The Messenger of Allah (gJ
denied that that was
real, as seen in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that we have quoted.
As for the h b a h from which he sought refuge for Hasan and
Husayn, that is something that does exist, and it is the
frightening vermin of the earth. It is an entirely different word
that has nothing to do with the h b a h of ancient Arab
superstition.371

5.5. The hadith of the cloak and
what is meant by Ah1 al-Bayt
The hadith of the cloak was narrated by 'kishah
She
said: "The Prophet (g)
went out one morning wearing a striped
cloak of black camel hair. He enfolded 'Ali, F i ~ a hal-Hasan
,
and
al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them) in it, then he said:
$Allah wishes only to remove ar-Rijs [evil deeds and sins] from you,
0 members of the family [of the Prophet], and to purify you with a
thorough
(Qur'un 33: 33)."373
This proves false the idea that the Companions concealed the
virtnes of 'Ali (&), because here is 'kishah (&), who they claim
hated 'Ali (&),
,.
narrating this virtue of 'Ali and htimah (may AUah
be pleased with them).374
This Qur'anic passage is addressed to all the wives of the
Prophet (g),
as it stws with them and ends with them. Allah says:

(0 Prophet Muhammad]! Say to your wives: 'If you desire the life
of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for
you and set you free in a handsome manner [divorce]. But if you
desire AUah and His Messenger, and the Home of the hereafter, then
verily, Allah has prepared for Al-Muhsinit [good-doers] amongst
you an enormous reward. 0 wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you
commits an open illegal sexual intercourse, the torment for her will
be doubled, and that is ever easy for Allah. And whosoever of you is
obedient to Allah and His Messenger, and does righteous good
deeds, We shall give her, her reward twice over, and We have
prepared for her Rizq Karim [a noble provision -paradise]. 0 wives
of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your
duty [to Allah], then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a
disease [of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery] should be moved
with desire, but speak in an honourable manner. And stay in your

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

159

houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of
ignorance, And perform as-Sal& [Iqhat-as-Sala], and give Zak&
and obey AUah and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove arRijs [evil deeds and sins] from you, 0 members of the family [of the
Prophet], and to purify you with a thorough purification. And
remember [0you the members of the Prophet's family, the Graces of
your Lord], that which is recited in your houses of the Verses of
Allah and Al-Hikmah [i.e. Prophet's Snnnah - legal ways, so give
your thanks to Allah and glorify His Praises for this Qur'an and the
Sunnah]. Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted
(Qur'an 33: 28-34)
with all things.)
The commands, prohibitions, promises and warnings are all
addressed to the wives of the Prophet (&, but because of the benefit
that is mentioned in these verses, they may include both the wives of
the Prophet
and others of Ah1 al-Bayt. Purification is mentioned
in the masculine (in the original Arabic) because when masculine and
feminine are mentioned together, the masculine predominates. So it
includes all of Ah1 d-Bayt, although 'Ali, Fi~imah,d-flasan and alHusayn (may Allah be pleased with them) are more entitled to this
honour than others; hence the Prophet (g)
singled them out to pray
for them.

(s)

Moreover, the phrase 'Ah1 al-Bayt' goes beyond 'a,
dHasan, al-Husayn and Fitinah to include others, as explained in the
hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam. When he was asked: "Are his wives
among the members of his household (ah1 baytihi)?" He said: "His
wives are among the members of his household, but the members of
his household are those to whom receiving zak& was forbidden,

discuss the verse in detail below, when we debate with the Shia.

5.6. Rulings that apply specifically to the
family of the Messenger of Allah (g)
5.6.1. Prohibition of zakiih for them
This is proven by the hadith narrated by 'Abdul-Mutplib ibn
Rabee'ah, according to which the Prophet (g)
said: ''Zak2h is not
befitting for the family of Muhammad, because it is impurity that
comes from people."377

5.6.2. There is no inheritance from
the Messenger of Allah

(a)

It is proven from the hadith of Abu Bakr (&): The Messenger
of Allah (g)
-,said: "We are not to be inherited from; what we leave
behind is
This hadith was narrated by Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
'Uthm2n, 'ALi, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa'd, 'Abdur-R&mk ibn 'Awf,
d-'Abbh ibn 'Abdul-Muttdib, the wives of the Prophet (g)
and
Abu Hurayrah, as stated by ibn Taymiyah, and it is proven from them
in the books of Saheeh and the ~ u s n a d s . ~ ~ ~

5.6.3. They are entitled to one-fifth of the
war booty (ghneemak380 and fay'381)
Allah says:
(And know that whatever of war booty that you may gain, verily,
one-fifth (115th) of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

161

to the near relatives [of the Messenger], [and also] the orphans, alMaszkeen [the poor] and the wayfarer, if you have believed in Allah
and in that which We sent down to Our slave Muhammad] on the
Day of Criterion [between right and wrong], the Day when the two
forces met [the battle of Badr]; and Allah is Able to do all things.)
(Qur'an 8: 41)

And Allah ( B )says:
dWhat AUah gave as booty [Fay'] to His Messenger [Muhammad]
from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger
Muhammad], the kindred [of Messenger, Muhammad], the orphans,
al-MasSeen [the poor], and the wayfarer, in order that it may not
become a f o m e used by the rich among you.)
(Qur'an 59: 7)

5.6.4. Sending blessings upon them
as well as the Prophet (&)
It was narrated that Ka'b ibn al-'Ajrah said: We asked the
Messenger of Allah (g):
0 Messenger of Allah, how should we send
blessings upon you, Ah1 al-Bayt? For Allah has taught us how to send
peace. He said: Say: 0 Allah, send blessings upon M&ammad and
upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon the family
of Ibriiheem; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And
send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of M+ammad,
as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibraeem; You are indeed
Worthy of Praise, Full of ~ l o r y . ' ~ ~

5.6.5. There is special love for them
This is represented in the report narrated by Zayd ibn Arqam
from the Prophet (g):
"I remind yon of AUah with regard to the
people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the
people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the
people of my household."383

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

Al-Queubi said: "This advice and urging in the strongest
terms implies that it is obligatory to respect his family and love them.
This highlights the obligation of the Muslims towards them and
leaves no excuse for anyone not to do it."384 Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq
(&) understood the Prophet's instmctions concerning Ah1 al-Bayt
properly, so he loved and honoured them, and he called for people to
honour and love them. Bukhari narrated with his chain of narration
going back to Abu Bakr that he said: "Prove your love for
in the way you treat his family."385
Muhammad (g)

(a)

This advice given by Abu Bakr
is addressed to the
people with regard to upholding the rights of the family of the
Prophet (g)
and showing love and respect to them. What Abu Bakr's
words mean is: Show your love and respect for him by honouting
them and not harming or offending them.386 He confirmed those
rights in what he said to 'Ali: "By the One in Whose hand is my soul,
the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (B)are dearer to me than
upholding ties with my own r e ~ a t i v e s . " ~ ~ ~of
l oAhl
v e al-Bayt is one
of the fundamentals of AN as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah. Ibn Taymiyah
said: "One of the basic principles of Ahl as-Snnnah wal-Jams'ah is
that they love the household of the Prophet (g);
they suppoa them
and take care of them, following the instructions of the Messenger of
Allah (@)."388 Al-Q%&'Iyiid said: "One of the signs of a person's
loving him [the Prophet (%)I is his loving those whom the Prophet
(B)
loved and those who are connected to him,such as the members
of his household and his Companions, both Muhgjireen and An&
(may AUah be pleased with all). Part of loving a thing is loving those
who love it."389 lbn Katheer said: "We do not deny the Prophet's
instructions conceming Ah1 al-Bayt and the command to treat them
kindly, respect them and honour them, for they are among the pure
offspring of the noblest household ever found on the face of the earth,
the best in lineage, especially if they follow the sound Sunnah and
they are among the followers and supporters of trnth, a7 were their

predecessors such as al-'Abbgs and his two sons and 'Ali and his
family and offspring (may Allah be pleased with them

5.7. 'Ali (&) at the Battle of m u d
At the Battle of m u d , the fighting began with a duel between
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) and Talhah ibn 'Uthmcn, who was carrying
the banner of the polytheists. He asked for a duel several times, and
'Aliibn Abi Tilib (&) went out and said to him: "By the One in
Whose hand is my soul, I will not leave you until Allah hastens yon
to hell by means of my sword or He hastens me to paradise by means
of your sword." 'Ali stmck him and cut off his foot, and he fell to the
ground, exposing his private parts. He said: "0 son of my uncle, I
adjure you by Allah and by our ties of kinship." He retreated from
him and did not W s h him off. The Messenger of Allah said: "Allihu
akbar" and some of his companions said to 'Ali:"Why didn't you
finish him off?" He said: "He is my cousin and he adjured me by the
ties of kinship when his private parts became uncovered, and I felt
embarrassed before him."391 After battle was joined, 'Ali(&) took
the banner following the slaying of Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr (A).
During the battle, 'Ali (&) killed many of the polytheists
despite the hardships that befell the Muslims in this battle, in addition
to his striving to defend the Messenger of Allah (B).~~''Ali(+)

battle, a large
number of the best of the Muhcjireen and An& were martyred, and it
left deep sorrow in the heart of the Messenger (g).
The enemy
managed to h a m the noble Messenger, causing his face to bleed, and
his daughter Fstimah and her husband 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (may Allah
be pleased with both) treated his wounds and stopped the flow of
blood that was running down his face and beard @
( J3"

164

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

(4)

The courage of 'Ali
was manifested in that battle when it
was mmoured that the Messenger (g)
had been killed, and 'Ali
could not fund him. He thought that there would be nothing worth
living for after the Prophet was gone, so he broke the scabbard of his
sword and attacked people until they opened up a pathway before
him. Then suddenly he saw the Messenger of Allah (3$$)395,and he
stood firm with him and defended him heroically, receiving sixteen
blows on that day.396
Immediately after the polytheist army withdrew from the
battlefield, the Messenger of Allah (B)sent 'Aliibn Abi T%b (&)
to find out where the enemy was headed. He said to him: "Go and
follow the people, see what they are doing and what they are up to. If
they have dismounted from their horses and mounted their camels,
then they are headed for Makkah; if they have mounted their horses
and are driving the camels, then they are headed for Madinah. By the
One in Whose hand is my soul, if they are headed for Madinah, I shall
go back and meet them there, and I shall fight them." 'Ali (&) said:
"So I set out after them to see what they were doing, and I found that
they had dismounted from their horses and had mounted their camels
and were headed for ~ a k k a h . " ~So
~ ' 'Ali (&) went and told the
Messenger of Allah (g)
the news about the people.398
From this we learn a number of lessons, which are as follows:
-

The courage of the Prophet (g),
who was in the midst of the
polytheist lines such that 'Ali could not reach him except after
exhausting efforts. He found the Messenger of Allah (g)
in
the midst of the enemy, fighting them until he received a
number of wounds.

-

The alertness of the Messenger (g),
who was keeping a close
watch on the movements of the enemy, and his ability to weigh
up the situation, analyse enemy behaviour, and make decisions
on that basis.

Xli ibn Abi Talib

165

-

His high morale, which is apparent from his readiness to fight
the polytheists if they headed towards Madinah.

-

The Prophet's confidence in 'Ali (&) and his knowledge of
the characters of men.

-

'Ali's chivalry when he withdrew from his opponent after the
latter's private parts became uncovered, and the Messenger of
Allah (g)
approved of that. This action teaches us the value of
proper conduct and how one should act with high standards,
even with the enemy and even on the battlefield.

-

The necessity of making sacrifices for the sake of Allah
With this attitude and spirit, Islam will prevail in this life, and
the martyr will attain paradise. This is what was proven to us
by some of the Muhsjireen and An$&in this battle and others.
The necessity of implementing the means. This was

-

(s).

(a)

demonstrated when the Messenger of Allah
stationed
some of the Companions on Mount Uhud, but they disobeyed
him and came down, and this was one of the causes of defeat.

-

The courage of 'Ali (&),
because if this army had seen him
, ..
when he was following them to find out what they were up to,
they would not have hesitated to kill him.399

5.8. 'Ali (&) in the Campaign of Banu an-Nadeer
The historians who examined this matter narrated that the
campaign of Banu an-Nadeer took place in the month of Rabee' alAwwal in the year 4 AH. Ibn alQayyim refuted those who said that
the campaign of Banu an-Nadeer took place six months after Badr,
by saying: ''M+ammad ibn Shihzb ai-Zuhri said that the Battle of
Banu an-Nadeer was six months after Badr, but this is a mistake or
error on his part. There can be no doubt that it took place after m u d .
What happened six months after Badr was the campaign of Banu

of Ibn ~ a t h e e r . ~ In
" this battle, the Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) did not know where 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib was one
night, and the Prophet (B)said: "He is on a mission on your behalf."
Soon after that, he brought the head of 'Azwak. He had lain in wait
for him until he came out with a group of Jews seeking to catch the
Muslims unaware and attack them. He was brave and a good archer,
but 'Ali (&)
, .,
attacked him and killed him, and the Jews fled.403

5.9. 'Ali (&) at the Battle of Hamra' al-Asad
This battle is regarded as the completion of the Battle of m u d .
The Muslims returned from Uhud on Saturday evening, 15 Shawwil
3 AH, and the next morning the people bad just left the dawn prayer
when the announcer of the Messenger of Allah (g)
announced that
they should get ready quickly to pursue the enemy, and that only
those who had been at m u d should go out. The people responded to
the call of the Messenger of Allah (g)
despite their wounds and
exhaustion, and foremost among them was the Messenger of Allah
himself (g).
He did not allow Abdullah ibn Ubayy to go out with
him, nor did he allow anyone who had not been present at m u d ,
except Jgbir ibn Abdullah ibn ' A m ibn H a r h ; his father was
martyred at Uhud, and his father had prevented him from taking part
at Badr and Uhud so that he could stay with his young sisters. The
The banner of
army went out, led by the Messenger of AUah (g).
m u d itsell was carried by 'Ali ibn Abi lib.^" The Muslims, led by
their noble Messenger (g),
reached Hamra' al-Asad, which was
thirteen miles from adi in ah, and camped there. This manoeuvre
surprised the Jews and the hypocrites because of its courage and
daring, and they became certain that the Muslim morale was high,

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

167

because if they were defeated they would not have pursued
~ u r a ~ s h The
. ~ ' Prophet's
~
going out to Hamra' al-Asad was also an
indication on his part of the importance of psychological warfare in
affecting enemy morale. He set out with his troops and went to
Hamra' al-Asad, and stayed there for three days. He ordered that f ~ e s
be lit; these fires could be seen from afar, and they filled the horizon
with their light, to the extent that Quraysh thought that the Muslim
army had huge numbers of men that they had no power to tackle, so
they left with their hearts filled with fear.406
Ibn Sa'eed said: "The Messenger of Allah (&)went with his
Companions and camped in Hamra' al-Asad. During those nights,
the Muslims lit five hundred fires that could be seen from afar, and
the noise of their camp and the sight of their fires could be heard and
seen in every direction, and Allah (&) suppressed their enemies by
means of that."407 The noble Qur'an referred to this 'cold war', and
Allah
recorded it in His book in the context of praising the
Companions (may AUah be pleased with them):

(s)

(Those who answered [the Call of] AUah and the Messenger
[ M ~ a m m a dafter
]
being wounded; for those of them who did good
deeds and feared AUah, there is a great reward. Those [i.e. believers]
unto whom the people [hypocrites] said, 'Verily, the people [pagans]
have gathered against you [a great army], therefore, fear them.' But it
[only] increased them in Faith, and they said: Allah [Alone] is
Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs [for us]. So
they rehlmed with grace and bounty from AUah. No hann touched
them; and they followed the good pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the
Owner of great bounty. It is only Shaytin [Satan] that suggests to you
the fear of his Awliy? [supporters and friends, polytheists,
disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger,
Muhammad]; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are [true]
believers)
(Qur'an 3: 172.175)

168

'Ali ibn Abi Tlilib in Makkah

5.10. 'Ali (&) and his attitude
towards the slander incident
The hadith of the slander describes the accusation that the
hypocrites made against 'kishah (I$$).The Messenger of Allah (g)
summoned 'Ali and Usgmah (may h a h be pleased with them both)
and consulted them about divorcing his wife, because there was a lot
of talk, and the Prophet (B)was wonied because there had been no
revelation for a long time. U s h a h told him what he knew about her
innocence and said: "0 Messenger of AUah, she is your wife and we
, said: "0
know nothing but good about her." As for 'Ali (41he
Messenger of AUah, Allah has not made things restricted for you, and
there are many women other than her. If you ask the slave woman,
she will tell you the truth."408 So the Messenger of Allah (g)
called
Bareerah and said: "0 Bareerah, have you seen anything to make you
suspicious?" Bareerah said: "No, by the One Who sent you with the
truth; if there is anything that I have seen that I could criticise her for,
it is that she is a young girl, and she falls asleep and forgets about the
dough of her family, and the lamb comes and eats it." The Messenger
of AUah stood up and complained on that day about Abdullah ihn
Ubayy ihn Salool. The Messenger of Allah
said from the
minbar: "By AUah, I do not know anything but good about my wife,
and they have mentioned a man409 about whom I know nothing hut
good, and he never entered upon my family except with me."410

(s)

What 'Ali said is to be understood as trying to help the Prophet
@) because of what he saw of his anxiety and distress as a result of

what was being said, and he was a man of strong protective jealousy.
'Ali (&) initially thought that if the Prophet (g)
divorced her, his
anxiety because of her would be reduced until her innocence was
established, in which case he could take her back.
What we learn from this is doing the lesser of two evils in
order to avoid the greater.411 An-Nawawi said: "Ali (&) thought

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

169

that it was in the Prophet's best interests, and he believed that
because of what he saw of the extent of his anxiety and upset, so he
did his best to advise him sincerely because he wanted to put his
mind at rest."412 'Ali (*)
did not say any word that could be
understood as criticising 'A'ishah (&,) in the slightest or implying
anything negative about her.413h at her his opinion of her was good;
all he was saying was: if you want to put your mind at rest about this
problem, then there are many others besides her, and if you want to
reach the truth of the matter, then ask the slave woman, and she will
tell you the truth, which is that 'A'ishah was innocent. Then after that
the Messenger of AUah (g)
addressed the people and explained that
'A'ishah was innocent and pointed out the seriousness of tarnishing
his honour wrongfully on the basis of fabrication. The advice of both
'Ali and Usimah looked positive and was in the interests of 'kishah
(&), and it increased the Prophet's conviction of what he knew of
his wife's goodness.414
The reader should be wary of the worthless and false reports
which suggest that 'Ali (+) said negative things about 'kishah
(&)with regard to the slander, on which some researchers have built
the notion that 'A'ishah (I&,) hated 'Ali (&), resented him, falsely
accused him of killing &
' %I
(&) and rebelled against him,
inciting huge numbers of Muslims to do likewise.415 These
researchers include 'Ali Ibr2heem Hasan in at-Tareekh al-Zslami ul'iim and Taha Hussein in his book 'Aliwa Banuhu4I6, and others.
We will discuss the strong relationship between the Mother of the
Believers 'kishah (&)and 'Ali (&) below inshallah, when we
discuss the Battle of the Camel.
The story of the slander is one of a series of trials and
hardships that the Messenger of Allah
encountered at the hands
of the enemies of the faith, but by k a h ' s kindness towards His
Prophet and the believers, He exposed its faults, and the sound

(s)

170

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib in MaMah

reports of history recorded the attitudes of the believers towards this
fabrication. These are attitudes from which the believers can learn a
lesson when they are faced with such fabrications in their lives. The
revelation has ceased, but the lessons remain for all generations until
Allah (%) will inherit the earth and everything on it.417In my book
as-Seerah an-Nabawzyyah 'Arad Waqci'i' wa Tahleel Awdth, I have
discussed the lessons and rulings that may be taken from the incident
of the slander.418

6. The most important exploits of
'Ali (&) between the Battle of the Trench
and the death of the Prophet (B)
6.1. 'Ali (&) at the Battle of the Trench
The attitude of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) at the battle of
the trench was heroic and brilliant. It was indicative of the strong
faith in the hearts of the Companions of the Prophet (giJand their
willingness to call people to the faith and to die for it, and to renounce
those who opposed it. Ibn Ishsq said: "Ali ibn Abi T%b went out
with a group of Muslims after the polytheist cavalry crossed a weak
point in the ditch and gained control of the spot from which they had
crossed. The Muslim horsemen raced towards them to confront them.
'Amr ibn 'Abd Wudd had fought on the day of Badr until he was
badly wounded, so he was not present on the day of m u d , but when
the day of the battle of the trench came, he marked himself to show
his position. Then he and the other horsemen took up their positions
and said: 'Who will come out to duel? 'ALi ibn Abi Tilib came out
and said to him: '0 'Amr,you have promised Allah that if any man of
Quraysh gives you one of two options, you will accept one of them.'

'Ali ibn Abi T2lib

171

He said: 'Yes.' 'Alisaid to him: 'I call you to Allah and to His
Messenger and to Islam.' He said: 'I have no need of that.' 'Ali said:
'Then I call you to a duel with me.' He said to him: 'Why, 0 son of
my brother? I do not want to kill you.' 'Ali said to him: 'But by
Allah, I want to kill you.' 'Amr got angry at that, so he dismounted
from his horse, hamstrung it and beat its face; then he turned to 'Ali,
and they fought, circling around one another, until 'Ali (&) killed
him and their cavalry fled, bursting headlong in flight across the
trench."419
Ibn Katheer quoted what al-Bayhaqi narrated in Dalri'il anNubuwwah of poetly composed by 'Arnr ibn 'Abd Wudd and 'Ali
(&). 'Amr said, when he came forth for the duel:

I've become hoarse from shouting.
Isn't there one among the lot of you who will answer my challenge?
I've stood here like a fighting champion
While the so-called brave are cowards.
I've always hastened to the front
Before the fight begins.
Bravery and generosity are in truth
The best qualities of a wanior.
When 'Ali came out to meet him, he said:

Don't be in a hurry. No weakling
Has come to answer your challenge.
A man of resolution and foresight.
Truth is the rejLge of the successful.
I hope to make the keening women
Busy over your corpse
Through the blow of a spear
Whose memoly will last while fights are talked of4'
'Ilaimah threw down his spear that day when he was running
from 'Amr,so Hassiin ibn Th2bit said:

172

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

As he fled, he threw his spear to us.
Perhaps, 'Ikrimah, you have not done such a thing before?
As you turned your back, you ran like an ostrich
Tuning neither to right nor lej?.
You didn't turn your back as a human being would,
The back of your neck was like a young hyena's.
After the killing of 'Amr ibn 'Ahd Wudd, the polytheists scnt
word to the Messenger of Allah (gJasking to buy his corpse for ten
thousand. He said: "Give them their corpse, for it is an evil corpse,
and the money collected for that is evil," and he did not accept
anything from them.
This happened when the Muslims were going through
hardship, but despite that, ha161 (permitted according to Islamic law)
is hala, and harrim (forbidden according to Islamic law) is h x h ,
and this is the standard of Islam in what is lawful and prohibited.
Compare this to some Muslims who try to come up with justifications
for consuming usury and the like."'

6.2. 'Ali (4)
at the Battle of Banu Qurayaah
In this campaign, 'Ali carried the banner of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
in the vanguard422.The campaign ended with agreement
to accept the arbitration of Sa'd ibn Mu'sdh, although at first they
were preparing to fight, and there was no question of arbitration. Ibn
Hishim said: "Ali ihn Abi T%b called out, when they were besieging
Banu QuraydhaJI:
- '0 battalion of faith!' He and az-Zubayr ihn al' A w w h went forth, and he said: 'By Allah, I shall go through what
Hamzah went through (meaning martyrdom), or I shall breach their
fortresses.' They said: '0 Muhammad, we will accept the arbitration
of Sa'd ihn ~ u ' i d h . " 'Thus
~ ~ ~Allah
instilled fear and panic in
the hearts of the enemies of the faith from the lips of that pious and

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

173

pure one ['Ali (&)I, because of what Allah gave him of courage and
willingness to die for the sake of the religion of Allah. He called to
his battalion with the dearest of names with which Allah (&) calls
His slaves; it is the call of faith that highlights the sincerity of his
belief, the righteousness of his deeds and his love of jihad for the sake
of Allah.424

(A)

When Sa'd ibn Mu'idh
determined that their fighters
should be executed, their women and children enslaved and their
wealth divided425,among those who carried out the executions were
'Ali ibn Abi Titlib and az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them
both).426

6.3. 'Ali (4)
at the Treaty of Hudaybiyah
and the pledge of Radwsn
During the campaign of Hudaybiyah and before the treaty,
some of the (Muslim) slaves left M&ah and went to the Messenger
of Allah (g).
Their masters wrote to him, asking him to return them,
hut the Messenger of Allah (@) refused to return them and said: "0
Quraysh, you should certainly stop, or Allah will certainly send upon
you one who will strike your necks with the sword in support of the
faith, one whose heart Allah
has tested for piety."427 The
Companions asked him anxiously: Who is that, 0 Messenger of
Allah? All of them were hoping to be the one who was meant by this
great testimony from the Messenger of Allah (g).
He said: "He is the
one who is mending a shoe (referring to 'Ali, who was doing
that)."428

(s)

When the treaty was drawn up between the Muslims and the
polytheists of Quraysh, 'Ali (&) wrote the document recording the
agreement between them. The Prophet (&$) said: "Write: Muhammad
the Messenger of Allah." The polytheists said: Do not write

174

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib in Mukkah

Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, for if you were the Messenger
of Allah, we would not be fighting you. He said to 'Ali: "Erase it."
'Alisaid: I am not the one who will erase it. So the Messenger of
Allah (@) erased it with his own hand. Then he made a treaty with
them on the basis that he and his Companions would enter (Makkah)
for three days, with their swords sheathed in leather scabbards.429
'Ali (&) refused to erase the words 'Messenger of Allah' because of
his love and veneration for the Messenger of Allah ( B ) . ~ ~ '
The extreme RZtfidis criticised the attitude of the Companions
and 'Umar ibn al-Khag%b(may Allah be pleased with them all) at
Hudaybiyah, and referred to 'Umar's questioning the Prophet (@)
about the treaty, and also the Companions' initial delay in offering
their sacrifices and shaving their heads until they saw the Messenger
of Allah (g)
offer his sacrifice and shave his head. But there is no
reason for criticism of 'Umar or anyone else among the Companions
who were present at Hudaybiyah. The reason for their attitude was
that the Messenger (g)
had seen in a dream that he entered Makkah
and circumambulated the Ka'bah, and he told his Companions about
that when he was in Madinah. When they went with him to
Hudaybiyah, none of them doubted that this dream would be fulfilled
that year. When the treaty came about, in which it was stipulated that
they had to go back (without entering Makkah) and return the
following year, it was very hard on the Companions of the Messenger
'Umar (&) raised the issue, as he was known for
of Allah (g).431
his strong commitment to the truth, and he asked the Messenger (@)
about the matter. However, the questions that he put to the Prophet
(g)
did not stem from any doubt on his part as to the trnthfulness of
what the Messenger (gg)was saying or from any objection to it;
rather he was asking for an explanation concerning what he believed,
which was that they were going to enter Makkah and circumambulate
the Ka'bah. His aim thereby was to encourage the Messenger of

illi ibn Abi Tilib

175

Allah (s)
., to enter Makkah and not go hack to Madinah, because he
thought that would offer support to the religion of Allah (&) and
annoy the polytheists.432
An-Nawawi said: "Umar's question and the words mentioned
do not represent doubt; rather it was a request to explain what he was
not aware of and an eagerness to humiliate the disbelievers and to see
Islam prevail, as is known of his attitude and his enthusiasm to
support the faith and to see the misguided humiliated."433 'Umar
(&) was acting on the basis of what he thought was right and on his
understanding of the situation, motivated by his strict adherence to
the truth, his strong support for the religion of Allah (B)
and his
deep love for it, in addition to what the Messenger of Allah (&) had
trained them to do in terns of offering advice and expressing their
views, which he (B)did in obedience to the command of Allah: $so
pass over [their faults], and ask [Allah's] forgiveness for them; and
consult them in the affairs) (Qur2an3: 159). The Prophet (g)
often
consulted them and followed their suggestions. He consulted them on
the day of Badr about going to intercept the caravan, and he followed
their advice. He consulted them on the day of Uhud about whether to
stay in Madinah or go out to fight the enemy; most of them advised
going out to fight the enemy, so he did that. He consulted them on the
day of the battle of the trench about making a peace deal with the
confederates by offering them one-third of the crops of Madinah that
year; the two Sa'ds (Sa'd ibn Mu'idh and Sa'd ibn 'UbZdah) refused,
so he gave up that idea. He consulted them on the day of Hudayhiyah
as to whether or not to attack the polytheists; Abu Bakr (&) said:
"We did not come to fight; rather we came to do 'umrah," and the
Prophet (@) accepted what he said?34 There are many other similar
occasions, which would take too long to list here. 'Umar (&)
was
,.
keen for the Messenger of Allah (g)
to follow his advice and
confront Quraysh and fight them, so he kept raising the issue with
him. He also raised the issue with Abu Bakr (&), but when he saw

176

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in MuWiah

that they were agreed, he stopped raising the issue and gave up his
opinion. The Messenger of Allah (g)
excused him because of what
he knew of his good intentions and sincerity.435
With regard to the Companions not offering their sacrifices or
shaving their heads until the Messenger of Allah (g)
did that, this
was not disobedience to the command of the Messenger of Allah
The scholars have given several explanations for it. Ibn pajar
said: "It was said that it was as if they hesitated because of the
possibility that the command was by way of recommendation only,
or in the hope that revelation would come annulling the treaty, or they
understood it as being connected to their entering Makkah and
completing their rituals (i.e., the command was general and there
would be a further, specific command to say that this should be done
after entering Makkah and doing 'umrah). That could have been
possible in their case because that was a time when abrogation was
taking place occasionally. It could be that they were too absorbed
with the issue and thinking too much about what had befallen them of
humiliation
as they thought - in spite of the fact that they
appeared powerfnl and capable of achieving their goal and
completing their rituals by means of force and power. Or it may be
that they delayed carrying out the command because they thought
that a command of a general type does not necessarily have to be
fulfilled immediately. And it may be that all of these reasons applied
to different groups among them."436

(e,)).

-

In some reports it says that when the Messenger (g)
saw that
they were not obeying, he entered upon his wife Umm Salamah and
told her about that, and she said: "0 Messenger of Allah, do not
speak to them because they are very distressed due to the tough deal
that yon have agreed to and then going back without achieving
She suggested to him, as it says in the report of Bukhari:
"Go out and do not speak to anyone until you have offered your

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

177

sacrifice and called your barber to shave your head." So he went out
and did not speak to anyone until he had done that; he slaughtered his
sacrifice and called his barber to shave his head. When they saw that,
they got up and offered their sacrifices.438Ibn Hajar said: "It may be
that she understood that the Companions interpreted the Prophet's
command to exit &%n as a concession to them, and that he was
going to continue in i h r h without availing himself of any
concession, so she suggested to him that he should exit ihr2m so as to
rule out that possibility in their minds, and the Prophet (g)
realised
that she was right, so he did that. Something similar happened to
them during the conquest of Makkah, when he told them to break the
fast in Ramadan. When they continued to refuse, he took the vessel
and drank, and when they saw him drink, they drank too."439
This is a good explanation and is befitting to the status of the
commanded
Companions of the Prophet (@). When the Prophet (g)
them to exit ik%n and he did not do it, they thought that what made
him tell them to do that was compassion for them, as was his usual
attitude towards them. It is as if they (may Allah be pleased with
them) preferred to follow his example rather than the concession
which allowed them to exit iwam, but when they saw that he had
exited &rim, they were certain that this was what was better for
them, so they hastened to do it. This is like what happened to them
when they reached Makkah
during their hajj with the Prophet (g):
and had done ~ w i and
f sci'i, he told them to exit ii@m and be
intimate with their wives, and make it an 'umrah. That was very
difficult for them, because of their veneration for their rituals, and
they said: "Should we go to 'Arafah with our private parts dripping
with semen?" When the Messenger (g)
heard about that, and he had
not exited i v m , he said to them: "0 people, exit i h r h . Were it not
for the offering I have brought with me, I would have done what you
are doing." J2bir (&), the narrator of the hadith, said: So we exited
i r a m ; we heard and we obeyed.440

178

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

All of this reflects the eagerness of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
., to do good and their desire to follow the
example of the Messenger of Allah (g)
completely.441
The Prophet's attitude in keeping quiet when 'Umar (&)
objected to the treaty sets a great example for the Muslim leaders rulers, scholars and callers - and shows them that they should be
patient and listen carefully to the opinions of others. They should
give room for everyone to express his or her opinion of what is in the
public interest, and they should not set up prisons to silence people.
In the treaty of Hudaybiyah, the Prophet (g)
demonstrated that the
freedom of an individual to express his or her opinion is guaranteed
in Islamic society, even if that opinion involves criticism of a ~ u l eor
r
caliph. It is the right of Muslims to explain their points of view in a
safe atmosphere, with no terror or oppression stifling freedom of
speech and thought. If this was the attitude of the Messenger of Allah
(g)
with 'Umar (&), then objecting to or opposing the president of
the state with regard to one of his opinions or decisions is not in itself
a crime that deserves punishment and for which a person deserves to
be thrown into the depths of
The Prophet's guidance also shows us how he trained his
Companions by deriving lessons from events. 'Ali (&), along with
other Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
who were present
at Hudaybiyah, attained the pleasure of Allah
and the following
verse was revealed concerning them: &deed, AUah was pleased
with the believers when they gave the Bay'ah [pledge] to you [0
Muhammad] under the treeb (Qur'an 48: 18). The Messenger of Allah
(@) said: "No one who swore allegiance under the tree will ever
enter
'Ali and his brethren such as Ahu Bakr, 'Umar and
others (may Allah he pleased with them all) had attained great honour
before, at Badr. The Messenger of Allah (g)
said about the people of
Badr: "And you do not know, perhaps AUah looked upon the people
of Badr and said: Do as you wish, for I have forgiven

6.4. 'Umrat al-Qada' (the fulfilled pilgrimage) in 7 AH
and 'Ali (&), and the custody of the daughter of
Hamzah (may Allah be pleased with them both)
Islam had a great impact and profoundly changed the
mentality of the people. Daughters had been regarded as a source of
shame for Arab nobles; in some tribes, the custom was to bury them
alive to escape the shame and as a result of the lack of interest in
daughters. In Islam, daughters became beloved, and the Muslims
began to compete to raise them. The Muslims were equal, and no one
was better than anyone else except by means of virtue or truth.445

a)

When the Prophet
wanted to leave Makkah, the daughter
of Hamzah followed him, calling out: "0uncle!" 'Ali turned to her,
took her by the hand and said to Fitimah (&): "Here is your
cousin." 'Ali, Zayd and Ja'far disputed concerning her. 'Ali said: "I
should take her because she is the daughter of my patemal uncle."
Ja'far said: "She is the daughter of my paternal uncle, and her
maternal aunt is my wife." Zayd said: "She is the daughter of my
brother." The Prophet
ruled that she should go to her matemal
aunt and said: "The maternal aunt is l i e the mother." He (@) said to
'Ali: "You are from me, and I am from you." He (g)
said to Ja'far:
"You resemble me physically and in attitude," and he said to Zayd:
"Yon are our brother and our freed slave." 'Ali said to the Messenger
of Allah (@): "Why don't you many the daughter of Hamzah?' He
said: "She is the daughter of my brother through b r e a ~ t f e e d i n ~ . " ~ ~

(a)

From this story, we learn a number of lessons and mlings:
1. The matemal aunt is like the mother.

2. The maternal aunt takes precedence over anyone else with
regard to custody, if there are no parents.
3. The Messenger of Allah (g)
praised Ja'far ibn Abi T2lib

180

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

(&) and described him as resembling him physically and

in attitude.

(a)

4. The virtue of Zayd ibn Hiitithah, as the Messenger
said to him: "You are our brother and our freed slave,"
because he was a brother to Hamzah ibn 'Abdul-MuEalib,
since the Messenger (g)
had established bonds of
brotherhood between them. According to his way of
thinking, he wanted to take on the duties of a brother
towards his brother, and duty dictated that he should he the
guardian of the daughter of Hamzah (&).

5. A woman's mamage does not cancel out her right to
ruled that custody be
custody, because the Prophet (g)
given to the wife of Ja'far even though the girl's paternal
aunt, Safiyyah hint 'Abdul-Muttalib, was still alive.
6. It is essential that the husband give his permission before
his wife takes custody of her sister's daughter, because the
wife's duty is to focus on the interests and benefits of her
husband, and custody may affect this interest in part. We
may note here that Ja'far ibn Abi Tilib asked for custody
of the daughter of his paternal uncle Hamzah to be given to
her maternal aunt, who was his wife, which indicates that
he approved of that.

7. If a chid is breastfed along with his patemal uncle, he
becomes his brother through breastfeeding, and all his
daughters become daughters of his brother through
breastfeeding, so it is forbidden for him to many them.447

d i that
~ ~ it~ took place in Safar or

181

Rabee' d-Awwal of 7 AH, after the return from Hudaybiyah. Ibn
was of the view that it took place in Jumida d-Oola 7 AH.
Imam az-Zuhri and Imam Milik said that it was in Muharram 6
AH?^' Ibn ~ a j a r ~thought
~'
that the view of Ibn Ishiq was more
correct than that of a l - ~ i q i d i . ~ ~ ~
During this campaign, the heroism of Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ibn Abi Tilib (&) was manifested, as was his position in relation to
Allah and His Messenger (g).
What Allah decreed of the conquest
of this Jewish colony was clearly of military and strategic
imporGmce?54 Khaybar, which was seventy miles northeast of
adi in ah,^^' was a Jewish colony which included strongholds and
was a military base for the Jews; it was their last foothold in the
Arabian Peninsula, and they were watching for calamities for the
~ u s l i m s They
~ ~ ~were
. conspiring with the Jews inside and outside
Madinah to attack Madinah, so the Messenger of Allah (g)
wanted
to be rid of them and to put his mind at rest as far as they were
concerned. The Messenger of Allah (g)
headed towards Khaybar
with his army, who were fourteen hundred strong. He started
besieging the fortresses of Khaybar and conquered them one by one,
but the fortress of Husn d-Qamoos held out against the Muslims. 'Ali
ibn Abi T%b was suffering from an eye infection457, and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
.- said: "I shall give this flag to a man at whose
hands Allah will grant victoly; he loves Allah and His Messenger,
and Allah and His Messenger love him." The people spent the night
wondering which of them would be given the flag. When morning
came, the people went to the Messenger of Allah (@J, all of them
hoping to be the flag-bearer. He said: "Where is 'Ali ibn Abi Taib?"
Tbey said: "0 Messenger of AUah, be has a problem in his eyes."
They sent for him, and he was brought, and the Messenger of Allah
(g)
spat in his eyes and prayed for him, and he was healed, until it
was as if there had been no pain in him. He gave him the flag, and

182

'Ali ibn Abi T a b in M a h h

'Ali (&) said: "0 Messenger of Allah, shall I fight them until they
become like us?" He said: "Advance cautiously until you reach their
open space, then invite them to Islam and tell them of their duties
before Allah. By Allah, if Allah were to guide one man through you,
that would be better for you than having red camels."458
He set out until Allah (%) granted him conquest of Khaybar.
One of the examples of his heroism there was that their king Marhab
came out to him, saying:
Khaybar knows that I am Marhab
A fully armed warrior, a tried and tested hero
When war comes, spreading its flames.

'Ali said:
I am the one whose mother named him Haydarah,
like a lion of the jungle, fnghtji~lto behold.
I return their attack with one more fierce.

He struck the head of Marhab and killed him, then victory
came at his hands.459
We learn a number of things from 'Ali's attitude during the
campaign of Khaybar, such as:

1.

The great virtue of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), as the
Prophet (@Jtestified to his love when he said: "He loves Allah
and His Messenger (g),
and Allah and His Messenger (g)
love him." Ibn Hajar said h a t what was meant was that 'Ali's
love for Allah and His Messenger
was perfect love;
otherwise every Muslim shares the general meaning of this
attribute with 'Ali (&). This hadith also refers to the words of
Allah: (Say [ 0 Muhammad] to mankind: If you [really] love
Allah, then follow me [i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow
the Qur'an and the Sunnah], Allah will love you and forgive

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

183

you your sins. And AUah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful)
(Qur'an 3: 31), as if he were hinting that 'Ali (&) had attained
such perfect obedience to the Messenger of Allah (gJthat he
deserved that Allah should love him.&'

2.

The blessing of the Prophet's supplication, as Allah answered
the supplication of His Messenger (g).
'Ali said: "I never got
sore eyes after the Prophet (g)
spat in my eye. ,3461 a Ali (&)
fell sick once, and the Prophet (g)
came to him as 'ALi was
saying: "0 Allah, if my time has come, then let me die
(quickly) and find relief; if my time has not yet come, then heal
me; and if You are testing me, then give me patience." The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said to him: "What did you say?" He
said: "0 Allah,
repeated it, and the Messenger of Allah (g)
heal him, 0 Allah, grant him well-being." Then he said, "Get
up." So he got up, and he never felt that pain again after
that.462

3.

There is no connection between this hadith and the inlamate of
'Ali (&). The Shia say that 'Ali (&) was supposed to be the
caliph after the Prophet (@), and they quote a number of
hadiths as evidence, including this one. In reality, these hadiths
point to his virtue but do not point to his imamate [or
caliphate]. They add false additions to this hadith that are not
sound according to the scholars of hadith, and which,
moreover, make no connection between his loving Allah
and His Messenger
and his being loved by them, on the
one hand, and his becoming the imam or caliph, on the other.
Moreover, affvming this quality of 'Mi (&) (his loving and
being loved) does not mean denying that others have the same
quality. How could that be the case when Allah ( B )says
concerning Abu Bakr (&,) and "I- companions:
wbom He will love and they will love Him,) (Qur'an 5: 54) and

(s)

(a)

184

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Mukkah

Allah says, conceming the people of Badr: #Verily, Allah
loves those who fight in His Cause in rows [ranks] as if they
were a solid structureb (Qur'un 61: 4)? Undoubtedly the one
whom Allah loves, His Messenger (&) also loves, and the
believer who loves Allah also loves His Messenger (g).
Allah
also says, conceming the people of the mosque of Qubi?': #In it
are men who love to clean and to purify themselves. And Allah
loves those who make themselves clean and pure.$ (Qur'an 9:
108)

When the Messenger of Allah (@J was asked: Who is the most
beloved of people to you?, he said: 'pishah. It was said: And
among men? He said: Her father.463 He made his comments
about love and being loved with regard to 'Ali (&), even
though this quality exists in others, for a subtle reason that we
may conclude from his saying, "At whose hands Allah will
grant victory."464 The reason is that if he had mentioned only
victory, some may think that there is no reason for his
superiority or virtue, because it is mentioned in the hadith:
"Allah may cause this religion to prevail by means of an
immoral man." This notion is dispelled by affirming that these
two qualities (loving Allah and His Messenger and being
loved by them) were present in him, so the point of mentioning
this quality (Allah granting victoly at his hands), and others is
to dispel this notion.465
4.

There are a number of things we learn from the hadith about
the virtues of 'Ali ( A )
at Khaybar, including the following:
- The virtue of the Companions is highlighted by the fact

that they were distracted that night from the glad tidings of
victory because they were preoccupied with finding out
who it was that loved Allah and His Messenger (B),
and
Allah and His Messenger (g)
loved him.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

185

- We leam to believe in the divine will and decree when we

see that the one who did not strive to attain that position
did attain it, while those who strove for it did not attain it,
because the Companions went early the next morning to
all of them hoping to be
the Messenger of Allah (g),
given the banner, but they were not given it. 'Ali ibn Abi
T2ib was sick and did not even try for it, but despite that
be was given the banner.
- We learn etiquette from his words 'be deliberate' or 'do

not rush'. The point here is tbat he told them to be
deliberate and not to be hasty, to call people to Islam
before fighting, and to call with wisdom. This is based on
his words, "...and tell them of their duties before Allah...",
because it is wise to complete the call, by giving tbe option
of Islam first, then telling them of their duties towards
Allah (&). It is not sufficient just to tell him to embrace
Islam, because he may or may not be able to implement
Islam in the way that you told him to implement it.
Therefore it is essential to continue to take care of him so
that be will not return to disbelief. Telling him about the
rights of Allah in Islam is based on the fact that the Prophet
(B)
said: "...and tell them of their duties towards Allah..."
- We leam of the reward for the one at whose hands even a

single person is guided, because the Prophet (&) said: "If
Allah were to guide one man through you, tbat would be
better for you than having red camels," meaning that is
better for you than all that is regarded as desirable in this
world. It does not mean, as some people think, that it is
better for you than giving red camels in charity.
- We leam about swearing an oath to confirm an idea,

said: "By Allah, if Allah were to
because the Prophet (g)

186

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

guide..." So the Prophet &).> swore, although he was not
asked to swear. The point here is that he was encouraging
'Ali
so that Allah would guide people through him,
and confirming this idea. Allah commanded His Messenger
(B)to swear in three places in the Qur'an, where He said:
(And they ask you [O Muhammad] to inform them
[saying]: 'Isit true [i.e. the torment and the estahlishment of
the Hour -the Day of Resurrection]?' Say: 'Yes! By my
Lord! It is the very truth!...'b (Qur'an 10: 53); (The
disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected [for
the Account]. Say [ 0 Muhammad]: 'Yes! By my Lord, you
will certainly be resurrected.# (Qur'an 64: 7) and B'I'hose
who disbelieve say: 'The Hour will not come to us.' Say:
'Yes, by my Lord, the Al-Knower of the Unseen, it will
come to you# (Qur'an 34: 3). I f there is any interest to he
served by swearing an oath, or any question to be answered,
then it is permissible and may even he required.466

(4)

6.6. 'Ali at the conquest of Makkah
and the campaign of Hunayn, 8 AH
Quraysh broke their treaty with the Messenger of Allah (g)
when they supplied Banu Bakr with horses, weapons and men, thus
supporting them against Khuzi'ah, who were allies of the Muslims.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "You will be supported, O 'Amr
ibn Ssim, and may AUah never help me if I do not help Banu Ka'b."
Then as a cloud appeared in the sky, he said: 'This cloud will provide
help for Banu ~ a ' h . "'Amr
~ ~ ihn
~ S h came to Madinah and
recited an ode before the Messenger of Allah (gJ,
in which he said:

0 Lord, I come to remind Muhammad
of the old alliance between our fathers.
You are sons for whom we provided the mother,

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

187

Then we made peace and have not changed our minds.
Help us, now God guide you,
And call God's servants to our aid.
Among them the Messenger of God prepared for war.
When he is wronged, his face becomes black with anger.
...
They claim that I can get no one to help us
And they but a miserable few.
They attacked us at night in al-Wateer
And killed us as we performed the ritual prayers
Quraysh sent Ahu Sufyin to Madinah to confirm the treaty and
extend its duration. When he amved in Madinah, he entered upon the
Messenger of Allah (g)
to discuss the matter, hut the Prophet is)
turned away from him and did not answer him. He sought help from
the senior Companions, such as Ahu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmh and 'Ali
(may Allah he pleased with them), asking them to intervene between
him and the Messenger of Allah (g),
hut they all refused, so Ahu
Snfyib went hack to Makkah without managing to make any deal or
covenant.468
During the conquest of Makkah, 'Ali (&) achieved a number
of t h g s , including the following:

6.6.1. Foiling attempts to spy for Quraysh
It was narrated from Hasan ibn Muhammad ibu 'Ali ihn
'IJbaydull2h ihu Abi R2fi' that he heard 'Ali say: "The Messenger of
Allah (&) sent us, me, az-Zuhayr and al-MiqdZd, and he said: 'Go to
the garden of K h m , in which you will find a woman riding a camel
with whom there is a letter, and take it from her.' We set out, with our
horses galloping, until we reached the garden and we found the
woman. We said: 'Give us the letter.' She said: 'I do not have a
letter.' We said: 'Either you give us the letter or we will remove your

188

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

clothes.' So she brought it out from her braided hair, and we brought
it to the Messenger of Allah (g).
In it (was written): 'From Hitib ibn
Abi Balta'ah to some of the polytheists of Makkah,' telling them
The
something about the plans of Messenger of Allah (g).
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: '0 Hitib, what is this?' He said: 'Do
not be hasty in judging me, 0 Messenger of AUah. I am a man who
was connected to Quraysh, but I was not one of them. The
Muhijireen with you have relatives who will protect their families in
Makkah. I have no blood ties among them, so I wanted to do them a
favour so that they would protect my family. I did not do it out of
disbelief, or because I apostatized from my religion, or because I
approved of disbelief after becoming Muslim.' The Messenger of
AUah (g)
said: 'He has spoken the truth.' 'Umar said: '0 Messenger
of ~ l l a hlet
, me strike the neck of this hypocrite.' The Messenger of
Allah (&) said: 'He was present at Badr, and you do not know,
p e r h a p s h a h (&) looked upon the people of Badr and said: Do
what you wish, for I have forgiven you. ,,,469

6.6.2. We grant protection to the one
to whom Umm H M granted protection
Umm H h i ' bint Abi Tilib, the sister of 'Ali (may Allah be
pleased with them both) said: "When the Messenger of Allah (g)
camped in the upper part of Makkah, two men among my in-laws,
from Banu Makhzoom, fled to me." She was married to Hubayrah
ibn Abi Wahb d-Makhzoomi. She said: 'Ali ibn Abi Tsib, my
brother, entered upon me and said: 'By Allah, I will kill them.' I
locked the door of my house on them, then I came to the Messenger
of Allah
when he was in the upper part of Makkah. I found him
washing himself (making ghusl) from a vessel in which there was a
trace of dough, and his daughter F i ~ a was
h screening him with his
gannent. When he had finished washing, he took his garment and put
"

(a)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

189

it on, then he prayed eight ~ a k a ' a h sof~the
~ ~optional morning
prayer. Then he turned to me and said: 'Welcome, 0 Umm H2ni'.
What brings you here?' I told him about the two men and about what
'Ali wanted to do. He said: 'We grant protection to the one to whom
you granted protection, and we grant security to the one to whom you
granted security, so he should not kill them."'471
Based on the above, if a Muslim gives protection to a
disbeliever whose people are in a state of war against Muslims, that
guarantees his safety, and hence it is not permissible for the Muslims
to harm him in any way. In order to protect the Muslims from any
harm that may result from giving protection, the Islamic jurists
stipulated that in order for it to be valid, the one who is offering
protection should be above suspicion, and the guaranteed protection
should not result in any bad consequences for the mu slim^?^'
Otherwise, the matter should be referred to the ruler to see what his
opinion is.

6.6.3. The killing of al-Huwayrith
ibn Naqeed ibn Wahb
This occurred d u ~ this
g great conquest. The Prophet (@) had
issued instructions to his commanders that they should only fight
those who fought them, but he also issued instructions to kill certain
people whom he named, even if they were found beneath the
coverings of the Ka'bah. One of these people was al-Huwayrith ibn
Naqeed ibn Wahb, who was one of those who had harmed the
Prophet
in Makkah. When d-'AbbZs had provided a camel for
Fgtimah and Umm Kalthoom, d-Huwayrith spooked the camel
which was canying them, and they fell to the ground. When
permission was given for him to be killed, 'Ali (&) caught him and
killed him.473

6.6.4. 'Ali (&) on a reconciliation mission
The Messenger (g)
sent 'Ali (&) to Banu Judhaymah to
make up for the mistake of Kh%d ibn al-Waleed, who had killed
some of their people. The Messenger (g)
had sent Khiilid in 8 AH,
following the conquest of Makkah, to Eknu Judhaymah to call them
to Islam. Because of differences in dialects, they could not say
aslamna ("'We have become Muslim); they said saba'na (literally:
"We have become renegades"). Hearing that, Khiilid killed some of
them and took some of them as prisoners. When the news reached the
he raised his hands and said twice: "0
Messenger of Allah (g),
Allah, I am innocent before You of what he has done."474 Then the
Messenger @) sent 'Ali (&) to them to examine their situation, and
he sent money with him. 'Ali
perfo~lnedhis mission very well.
He paid compensation for those who had been slain and compensated
them for the loss of wealth, and even for the water howl of a dog.
When he had finished with all of that, he asked them: "Is there
anything left of life or wealth for which you have not been
compensated?" They said: "No." He said: "I will give you what is
left of this money on behalf of the Messenger of Allah (g),
in case
claims should arise that neither he nor yon know right now." When
he went back to the Messenger of Allah (@) and told him what he
had done, he said: "You did right, and you did
By means of
this important mission, 'Ali (&) removed a burden and wony that
was troubling the Messenger (@)y6With this wise attitude, the
Prophet
consoled Banu Judhaymah and removed the grief and
sorrow that were in their hearts.477 Kh%d's slaying of Banu
Judhaymah stemmed from a misunderstanding of the situation and
misjudgement on his part. This conclusion is based on the fact that
-, did not punish him for what he had done478and
the Messenger (g)
did not dismiss him from his post.

6.6.5. 'Ali (&) during the campaign to Hunayn
One of his exploits in jihad, which were characterised by
courage and which point to 'Ali's (&,) expertise in fighting, was
what happened during the campaign of Hunayn in 8 AH. He stood
fm with the Messenger (&) and those of the Muhijireen and An$%
who stood finn with him. In the army of Hawizin, there was a man
on a red camel, in whose hand was a black flag. When he could reach
people, he stabbed them with his spear, and when he could not reach
them, he would raise his spear for those who were behind him so they
would follow him. 'Ali(&), with his military brilliance and lengthy
experience, realised that this man was an influential factor in
motivating Hawkin and making them put up a tough fight. So 'Ali
ibn Abi T2ib (&) and a man of the An& went towards him and
managed to topple him from his camel and kill him. After that, it was
not long before they were defeated and fled, and the Muslims were
victoriou~."~

6.6.6. 'Ali's expedition to destroy the idol
al-Falas in the land of Tayy'
After the Prophet (g)
had p d ~ e the
d Ka'bah of the idols that
were in it, it was necessary to destroy other houses which had been
symbols of jailiyyah for a long time!"
Expeditions sent by the
Messenger of Allah (B)went out one after another to purify Arabia.
'Ali's task was to destroy the idol of al-Falas in the land of Tayy', and
his expedition set out in Rabee' a l - h . There were 150 men of the
An$& in the expedition, riding one hundred camels and fifty horses,
with a black banner and a white flag. They launched their attack on the
area belonging to A1 Hitim - Hitim aC-T?i, whose generosity was
proverbial - at dawn. They attacked al-Falas and destroyed it, and
they gained plenty of prisoners, cattle and sheep. Among the captives
was the sister of 'Adiyy ibn Hgtim, and 'Adiyy fled to ~ y r i a . 9 ~ '

6.7. The Prophet (g)
appointed 'Ali
in charge of Madinah during the
campaign of Tabook in 9 AH
The campaign to Tabook took place in the month of Rajah, 9
AH. This campaign was of immense importance in the life of the
and it achieved aims which had a far-reaching effect on
Prophet (g),
the hearts of the Muslims and Arabs and on the course of Islamic
history.48ZThe Messenger of AUah (g)
appointed 'Ali (&) in
charge of Madinah, and the hypocrites found an opportunity to
express their inward feelings of resentment and hypocrisy. They
began to talk about 'Ali (&) in negative terms. For example, they
said that the Prophet had only left him behind because he could not
put up with him. These bad actions and words of theirs were a clear
sign of their hypocrisy. In the sound hadith, it says that 'Ali (&)
said: By the One Who split the seed and created the soul, the
unlettered Prophet (g)
afhmed to me: "No one loves me except a
believer, and no one hates me except a
At that point,
Ali went and caught up with the army, and he wanted to go out on
campaign with them. He asked: "0 Messenger of Allah, have you left
me behind among the women and children?" The Messenger of
Allah (g)
said to him: "Do you not want to be to me as Haroon was
to Moosa, except that there is no Prophet after me?"484

6.8. 'Ali (4)and his media role during
the pilgrimage led by Abu Bakr, 9 AH
Efforts to educate society and build the state were ongoing at
all levels during the time of the Prophet 1%) in all fields, be they
ideological, economic, social, political, military and devotional. The
obligation of hajj had not been practised during previous years. In 8
AH, after the conquest of Makkah, 'It& ibn Usayd was appointed in

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

193

charge of it, but the hajj of the Muslims had not yet been made
distinct from the hajj of the polytheists!85 When hajj season came in
9 AH, the Prophet (g)
wanted to perform hajj, but he said: ''If the
polytheists circumambulate the House naked486,I would not like to
do hajj." So Abu Bakr (&) set out with a large number of the
Companions, and they took the sacrificial animals with themyE7
When Abu Bakr (&) set out with the pilgrim caravan, Soorah
Bari'ah4" was revealed. The Prophet (g)
called 'Ali (&) and
ordered him to catch up with Ahu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&). So he set
out on al-'Adha', the she-camel of the Messenger of Allah (@I, and
caught up with Ahu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) at Dhul-Hulayfah. When
Abu Bakr (&) saw him, he said to him: "Are you coming to lead or
be led?" He said: "To be led." So they went on together, and Abn
Bakr led the people in hajj, following the same sequence of rituals as
they had done during the jailiyyah. The hajj in that year was in the
month of Dhul-Hijjah, as indicated by sound reports, and it did not
take place in Dhul-Qa'dah as some people say.
Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) gave speeches before at-Tamiyah,
on the day of 'Arafah, on the day of sacrifice, and on the first day of
departure. He taught the people their rituals: standing in 'Arafah,
departing from there, sacrifice, departure, the symbolic stoning of the
devil and so on, with 'Ali (&)
. . following him each time, reciting the
opening verses of Soorah Bari'ah, then proclaiming to the people
each time these four things: "No one but a believing soul will enter
paradise; the House is not to be circumambulated naked; whoever
has a covenant with the Prophet (@), it stands until it expires; and the
polytheists and the Muslims are not to perform hajj together after this
year."489 Abu Bakr (4)
ordered another group of the Companions
to help 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) carry out his mission!90
The revelation of the first verses of Soorah Bari'ah marked the
final break with idolatly and its followers, as their pilgrimage was
banned, and war was declared against them.491

Allah

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

(s)
says:

(Freedom from [all] obligations [is declared] from Allah and His
Messenger to those of the Mushrikoon [polytheists,pagans, idolaters,
disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah], with whom you made a treaty.
So travel freely [ 0 Mushrikoon] for four months [as yon will]
throughout the land, hut know that you cannot escape [from the
punishment of] Allah, and Allah will disgrace the disbelievers. And a
declaration from Allah and His Messenger to mankind on the greatest
day [the 10th of Dhul-&jjah - the 12th month of Islamic calendar]
that Allah is free from [all] obligations to the Mushrikoon and so is
His Messenger. So if you [Mushrikoon] repent, it is better for yon,
but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape [from the
punishment of] Allah. And give tidings [O Muhammad] of a painful
torment to those who disbelieve.)
(Qur'an 9: 1-3)
Those who had covenants were given respite until the end of
their covenants. Allah (&) says: (Except those of the Mushrikoon
with whom you have a treaty, and who have not subsequently failed
you in aught, nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their
treaty to them for the end of their term. Surely, AUah loves AlMuttaqoon [the pious].), (Qur'an 9: 4 )
Respite was also given to those of the polytheists who had no
covenant until the end of the sacred months, at which point they
would be in a state of war with the Muslims. Allah (&) says: (Then
when the Sacred Months [the lst, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the
Islamic calendar] have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon wherever
you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for
them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk
(polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform as-Sala
[Iqimat-as-Sal2h], and give Zakiih, then leave their way free. Verily,
AUah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Mercifu1.B (Qur'an 9: 5)

The Prophet (g)
-, appointed 'Ali (&)
to announce the
breaking of covenants to the polytheists during the hajj season,
because customarily when the Arabs wanted to make or cancel a
covenant, no one could do that except the chief of the tribe or a man
from his family, and this custom was not contraty to the teachings of
Islam, hence the Prophet (g)
sent 'Ali (&) with these instructions
before it was too late. This is the reason why 'Ali (&) was appointed
to convey the opening verses of Soorah Bari'ah, and it is not as the
Rzfitfidisclaim, that this was to indicate that 'Ali was more entitled to
the caliphate than Abu Bakr (&). Dr. Muhammad Abu Shahbah
commented on that and said: I do not h o w how they overlooked the
words of Abu Bakr (&): "Are you coming to lead or be led?"492 Or
how the one who is to be led can be more deserving than the one who
is to lead?493 This pilgrimage paved the way for the Farewell
Pilgrimage. During the hajj of Abu Bakr (&), it was announced that
the era of idols had come to an end and that a new stage had begun,
and that all the people had to do was to respond to the laws of Allah
(B).After this announcement, which spread among the Arab tribes
throughout A~abia,these tribes became certain that the matter was
serious and that the era of idolatry was indeed over, so they began
sending delegations to declare their Islam and their belief in the
Oneness of Allah ( B )( t a ~ h e e d ) . ~ ~ ~

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib in Makkah

the letter reached the bishop, he gathered the people together and read
it to them, then asked them what they thought about it. They decided
to send a delegation composed of fourteen of their nobles, or it was
said sixty riders, of whom three were in charge: al-'Aqib, who was
their leader and the one whose advice and opinion they followed; the
chief who was in charge during travel; and Abu al-Hzth, their
bishop and scholar who was in charge of their education.497When
the delegation of Christians from Najrh came to the Messenger of
Allah (g)
in Madinah, they took off their travelling clothes and put
on their hibarah 498 garments, which they allowed to drag along the
floor, and their gold rings, then they set out to meet the Messenger of
AUah (g).
They greeted him, but he did not return their greeting.
They tried for a long time to talk to him, but he refused to speak to
them while they were wearing these garments and gold rings. So they
went and looked for 'Uthmh ibn 'Affm and ' A b d u r - R b k ibn
'Awf (may Allah be pleased with them both) because they knew
them. (They used to take their camels to N a j h during the jailiyyah
so that their chief would buy wheat, crops and corn for them.) They
found them among some of the An$& in a gathering, and they said:
"0 ' U t h h , 0 'Abdnr-R*k,
your Prophet wrote a letter to us
and we came in response; we greeted him, but he did not return our
greeting. We have been trying to speak to him all day; we tried hard
to speak to him but to no avail. What do you think? Should we go
back?"
They said to 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&), who was present in the
gathering: "What do you think, 0 Abu al-Hasan, about these
people?' He said: "I think that they should take off these garments of
theirs and their rings, and put on their travelling clothes and go to
him." The delegation did that, then they went back to the Messenger
of Allah (g).

"We were

The Prophet (@) said: "Three things are
keeping you from Islam: your worship of the cross, your eating pork
and your claim that Allah has a son."501 The argument and debate
between him and them intensified, with the Prophet reciting Qur'an
to them and refuting their falsehood with evidence. Among the things
that they said to the Messenger of Allah (g)
was: "Why are you
insulting our man (meaning 'Eesa) and saying that he is a slave of
Allah?" He said: "Yes indeed, he is a slave of Allah and His
Messenger and His word that he bestowed upon Maryam the virgin."
They got angly and said: "Have you ever seen a man without a
father? If you are telling the truth, show us someone like him." Then
Allah revealed the response to them in the verse:
BVerily, the likeness of 'Eesa [Jesus] before Allah is the likeness of
Adam. He created him from dust, then me] said to him: 'Be!' -and
he was. [This is] the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who
doubt.)
(Qur'an 3: 59-60)
It was a decisive proof which likened that which was
extraordinary to something that was even more extraordinary.502
When debating with wisdom and beautiful preaching did not work
with them, he invited them to r n u b i i h a ~ a h ~
in~obedience

to the
command of Allah:

Muhammad]: 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women

invoke [sincerely] the curse of Allah upon those who lie')

6.10. 'Ali (&) engaging in da'wah
and as a judge in Yemen, 10 A H
After the conquest of Makkah, the Arab tribes in Arabia
responded to Islam, and the Messenger of Allah sent some of his
Companions to the tribes who had not yet responded, to call them to
Islam. He sent 'Ali (&) to Hamad& in Yemen. Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib
tells us of what happened when he went with 'Ali (&) to
Yemen. He says: "...when we reached the borders of Yemen, the
people heard about that, and they gathered to meet him. 'Mi (&)led
us in prayer, and when he had finished, he made us all sit in one row.
He stood before us and praised and glorifed Allah (&), then he read
to them the letter from the Messenger of Allah (@J.All of Hamad&
became Muslim in one day, so he wrote to the Messenger of Allah
(B)to tell him the news. When the Prophet read his letter, he fell
down in prostration and said: 'Peace he upon Hamadiin, peace be
upon ~ a r n a d h . " ' The
~ ~ ~Messenger of Allah
was very
concerned about the southern front of his state and anxious for the
Yemeni tribes to enter Islam. This concern and attention led to the
brilliant results achieved by the da'wah efforts, as indicated by the
many delegations that came to Madinah from all parts of Yemen.
This indicates that the efforts made by the envoys to Yemen were
continuous and far-reaching.

AUah ( B ) snpported these peaceful da'wah activities, as he sent
Kh%d ibn d-Wdeed (A),then 'Ali ibn Abi T 2 b (&). The
Prophet (B)targeted
people and centres of influence in
society, who could play an important role in building states. He
followed this great principle throughout his life.5"
The Messenger of Allah (g)
commanded 'Ali (&) to judge
between the people in Yemen. 'Ali (&) himself told us about that
when he said: "The Messenger of AUah (&) sent me to Yemen. 1 said
to him: '0Messenger of Allah, are you sending me to people who are
older than me, when I am young and do not know much about
judicial matters?' He placed his hand on my chest and said: '0 Allah,
make his tongue steadfast and guide his heart. 0 'Ali, when two
disputants sit before yon, do not pass judgement between them until
yon listen to the second one the way you listen to the first one. If you
do that, you will know what is the correct judgement."' 'Ali said: "I
never had any confusion concerning a judgement after that."508

After Islam spread in their country, the Yemenis needed
people to teach them about their religion and to judge between them
in accordance with the d i n g s of Allah (B).
The Messenger of AUah
( g ) sent a number of the Companions, including Mu'2dh and Abu
Moosa d-Ash'ari, to various parts of Yemen, and one of the best of
them was 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&). The books of history, hadith and
Islamic jurispmdence have preserved for us a number of the
judgements that 'Ali (&)passed
,.
when he was in Yemen, including
the following:

6.10.1. Ws judgement concerning the four people
who pushed one another beside a trap dug for a lion

Messenger of Allah
sent me to Yemen, and they came to some
people who had built a trap for a

another, and one man fell, so he grabbed onto another one, who then
grabbed onto another one5'', until all four of them ended up in the
trap, and the lion wounded them. Then a man came and killed the lion
with a spear, and they all died of their wounds. The next of kin of the
first man went to the next of kin of the last man, and they took out
weapons to fight, so 'Ali (&) came to them right away5" and said:
"Do you want to fight one another when the Messenger of Allah (g)
is still alive? I will judge between you, and if you agree, then that is
the verdict. Otherwise, keep away from one another until yon go to
the Prophet
and he will be the one who judges between you,
then whoever Lsgresses after that will have no right. Collect from
the tribes of those who dug the hole one-fourth of the amount of
compensation for a life, one-third of the amount, one-half of the
amount and a complete amount. For the first man (who fell in), there
will be one-fonrth because he caused the death of the one who came
after him; for the second one, there is one third; for the third, there is
half; and for the fourth, there is the complete amount." They refused
to accept that, so they went to the Prophet (g)
when he was at
M a q h Ibr&eem and told him the story, and he said: "I will judge
between you." One of the people said: 'Ali (&) has already passed
judgement. They told him about it, and the Messenger of Allah (g)
approved it.512

6.10.2. Three men who had intercourse
with a woman in the same month
It was narrated from Zayd ibn al-Arqam that he said: "A case
was brought to 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) when he was in Yemen,
concerning three men who had had intercourse with a woman during
one cycle of her being free from menses. He asked two of them, 'Do
you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?' And they said,
'No.' He asked another two of them, 'Do you affm that this child

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

201

belongs to (the third man)? And they said, 'No.' Every time he asked
two of them whether they affirmed that the child belonged to the
third, they would say no. So he cast lots between them and attributed
the child to the one whose name was chosen in this manner, and
obliged him to pay two-thirds of the compen~ation."~The Prophet
(&) was told of this, and he smiled so broadly that his back teeth
became visible."514The Messenger of Allah (@) smiled because he
was happy that Allah (%) had guided 'Ali (&) to the right
judgement, hence he approved of that5" It is possible that this
happened before these people became Muslims, because what they
did is forbidden in the religion of Allah (%).'l6

6.11. 'Ali (&) during the Farewell Pilgrimage
'Ali (&) caught up with the Messenger of Allah (gJ
during
the Farewell Pilgrimage. The Messenger of Allah (g)
slaughtered
sixty-three camels with his own hand, and the number of animals he
sacrificed (sixty-three) was equal to the number of years of his life.
Then he stopped and told 'Ali (&) to slaughter the rest of the
hundred, so he did that and completed the number. 'Ali (&)
described to us some of the rituals during his hajj with the Messenger
of Allah (B).
It was narrated from 'Miibn Abi T a b (&) that the
Prophet (&)stood in 'Arafah, with U s h a h ibn Zayd riding behind
him, and said: "This is the place of standing, and all of 'Arafah is a
place of standing." Then he moved on, driving his camel carefully,
and the people started rushing right and left, and he turned to them
and said: "Calmly, 0 people; calmly, 0 people," until he came to
Muzdalifah, where he joined two prayers together, then he stopped in
Muzdalifah. He stopped in Quzah, and a l - F d ibn al-'AbbL rode
behind him, and he said: "This is the place of standing, and all of
Muzdalifah is a place of standing." Then he moved on, driving his
camel carefully, and the people were rushing right and left, and he

202

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib in Makkah

turned to them and said: "Calmly, calmly, 0 people." When he came
to Muhassir, he made his mount speed up, until he came out of it,
then he went back to his previous speed. After he had done the
symbolic stoning of the devil, he came to the place of sacrifice and
said: "This is the place of sacrifice, and all of Mina is a place of
sacrifice."
A yonng woman from Khath'am came to him and said: My
father is an old man, and he has become senile. Now the command of
Allah (g)
for hajj has come, and he cannot perform it; can I do it on
his behalf? The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Yes," and he started
turning the face of Fad1 ihn al-'Ahbb away from her. Then another
man came to him and said: I stoned the devil and did the taw% of hajj
and exited ihr%m,hut I did not shave my head. He said: "It doesn't
matter; shave your head." Another man came to him and said: I
stoned the devil and shaved my head and exited i h r h , hut I did not
offer a sacrifice. He said: "It does not matter; offer your sacrifice."
did the tawif of hajj. After
Then the Messenger of Allah (g)
that, he called for a bucket of Zamzam water, drank from it and made
ablutions. Then he said: "Draw water from Zamzam to give to the
pilgrims.517 0 Banu 'Ahdul-Muwb, were it not for my fear that it
may he taken from
I would have drawn water." Al-'Ahhk
said: "0 Messenger of Allah, why did I see you turning the face of
your nephew away?" He said: "I saw a young man and a yonng
woman, and I feared for them with regard to the

announced to the people whatever the Prophet (gJ
commanded him.
It was narrated from 'Amr ibn Saleem that his mother said: "While
we were in Mina, we saw 'Ali ibn Ahi T%lib (&) saying: The
Messenger of Allah (
8says:
) 'These are the days of eating and
drinking, so no one sh&d fast.' And he followed the people on his
camel, shouting that."520

6.12 The honour of washing and
burying the Prophet (g)
When the Prophet ( g ) died, 'Ali (4)
was one of those who
washed him, along with & - ~ a d libn al-'Abbk and U s b a h ibn
~ a ~ d 'Ali
. ~ (&)
"
said: "1 washed the Messenger of Allah ( g ) , and
I checked to see what is usually seen in one who is deceased, hut I did
not see anything; he looked good in life and in death."522He said:
"May my father be sacrificed for the good (meaning the Prophet);
how good you looked in life and in death."523 'Ali (&)
. . was among
those who went down into the grave of the Messenger of Allah ( g )
and buried him, along with al-Fdl ihn 'AbbSls, Qatham ibn 'Ahbh
and Shuqrin, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (3g).524
The news of the death of the Messenger of Allah (g)
struck
the Companions like a thunderbolt, because of their intense love for
him and because they were used to living under his care, like children
living under their father's care, only more so. The share of that care
that Ah1 al-Bayt and the Hhhimi family - foremost among them
FSl!imah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) and 'Ali ihn
Abi Taih - enjoyed was greater than others for obvious reasons,
based on natural human inclination and the fact that they were closely
related; they were characterised by sensitive feelings, sbong
emotions and deep love. But they bore this calamity with strong faith,
acceptance of the decree of Allah and submission to His command.525

6.13. The story of the letter that the Prophet (g)
thought of writing during his final illness
It is proven in Bukhari and Muslim and elsewhere in the hadith
of Ibn 'Abhiis (&) that he said: "When the Messenger of AUah ( g )
was dying and there were some men in the house, the Prophet (@J
said: 'Come, let me write you a document after which you will never

204

'Ali ibn Abi Triib in Makkah

go astray.' Some of them said: 'The Messenger of Allah (g)
is
overcome with pain, and you have the Qur'an; the Book of Allah is
sufficient for us.' The people in the house disagreed and argued.
Some of them said: 'Bring @en and paper) and let him write a
document, after which you will never go astray'; and some of them
said something different. When their idle talk and argument became
too much, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Get up and leave."'
Abdullah said: Ibn 'Abbk used to say: "What a calamity it was when
the Messenger of Allah (g)
was prevented from writing that
document because of their disagreement and noise."526
According to another report from Ibn 'Abbb (&), he said:
'"I'hursday and what a Thursday! The Messenger of Allah (g)
took a
hun for the worse, and he said: 'Bring me @en and paper) and I will
write for you a document, so you will not go astray after I am gone.'
But they argued (about that), and it is not appropriate to argue in the
presence of a Prophet. They said: 'What is the matter with him? Is he
delirious?527Try to find out from him.' He said: 'Let me be, for the
state in which I am now is better. I instruct yon to do three things:
expel the polytheists from the Arabian Peninsula and reward the
delegations as I used to do.' Then he remained silent about the third,
or it was said he forgot it."528 There is no reason to criticise the
companions of the Messenger of AUah regarding what is proven in
s
this hadith and other sound reports. As for what the R Z ~ mention
of criticism, it is false and known to be flawed. The scholars
answered some of it a long time ago, and among their responses were
the following points:

1. Difference of opinion among the Companions is proven to have
happened, and the reason for it was the different ways in which they
understood the words of the Messenger (@Jand what he meant; they
did not intend to disobey him. A I - ~ u ~ bthe
i , author of al-Mufhim,
said: "The reason for all of that was difference in interpretation,

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

205

which is something acceptable in Islam, as they all had good
intentions. Everyone who strives to reach the proper understanding is
correct, or one of the two who hold different views is correct and the
other is not sinning; rather he is rewarded, as is established according
to the fundamentals of slam."^'^ Then he stated that the Prophet (g)
did not rebuke them or criticise them; rather he said to them all: "Let
me be, for the state in which I am now is better. "530 This is something
similar to what happened to them on the day of al-Alpgb, when the
Messenger (8)
said to them: "Nobody should pray 'A$r except in
Banu ~ u r a ~ & m h .Some
"~~~
people were worried that they might
miss the time for 'Asr, so they prayed before they reached Banu
Qurayaah, whereas others said: 'We will only pray where the
Messenger of Allah (g)
told us to." And he did not rebuke either of
the two

2. As for what the Rgfidis claim, that the difference of opinion
between the Companions and what it led to, namely the fact that that
the Prophet
did not write that document for them, is what
deprived the Urnmah from protection against falling into error, it is
false because it wonld mean that the Messenger (&) gave up
conveying that which could protect the Ummah from going astray.
This faulty claim by the R2fifidisalso wonld mean that he (g)
failed
to convey the message of his Lord just because his Companions
differed in his presence, until he died without passing on that
message. This would mean that he went against the command of his
Lord, Who said: $0 Messenger [Muhammad]! Proclaim [the
message] which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if
you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. Allah will
protect you from mankind.) (Qur'an 5: 67)

(s)

The Prophet (g)
.- cannot have done that (failed to convey the
message) because AUah (&) praised him when He said: (Verily,
there has come unto you a Messenger [Muhammad] from amongst

206

Xli ibn Abi Talib in Makkah

yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or
difficulty. He Muhammad] is anxious over you; for the believers [he
is] full of pity, kind, and merciful.) (Qur'an 9: 128)

(s)

Thus Allah
described him as anxious that his Ummah should be
-wided and that all benefits in this world and in the hereafter should
reach them, as Ibn Katheer said in his commentary.533If this was a
well established fact in the religion of Islam, no one in whose heart
there is an atom's weight of fajth should have any doubt about that.
He or she should believe that this noble Messenger (@J had
conveyed the message as commanded, and that he was most womed
about his Ummah, which is established in mutawitir reports that
describe his jihad and sacrifices, and all the reports about the Prophet
(g)
confirm that. Once this is established, then we know for certain,
beyond any shadow of a doubt, that if the matter was as the Rifidis
said -when they described this document as the one that could have
protected the Ummah from misguidance in religious affairs and
prevented divisions and disputes until the Hour begins - then it
would not have been justifiable, on the basis of religious or rational
evidence, for the Messenger of Allah (g)
to delay writing that
document until that critical time. Even if he had delayed it until then,
he would not have given up the idea just because his Companions
differed concerning the matter.534 It cannot be imagined that the
Prophet (g)
would forsake the command of his Lord, even if we
assume that he gave up that idea at that moment because of the
dispute in his presence, for some reason that he saw fit.
What could have prevented him from writing it later on, since it is
proven that he lived for several more days after that incident?
According to what is stated in the report of Anas in Bukhari and
~ u s l i mthe
, ~Prophet
~ ~ (g)
died on Monday, whereas this incident
with the document took place on Thursday, according to
consensus.536It is proven by the consensus of both the Sunnis and

'AZi ibn Abi TiiZib

207

the R%fi(lis that the Messenger of Allah ( g ) did not write that
document before he died, so we know that it was not part of the
religion that he was commanded to convey, because of the evidence
in the Qur'an which indicates that Allah ( , ) had completed the
religion for him and his Ummah. Before that, during the farewell
pilgrimage, the words, 4This day, I have perfected your religion for
you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for yon Islam
as your religion,) (Qur'an 5: 3) had been revealed.
Ihn Taymiyah said: "Writing the document was not something that
Allah (s)
had enjoined upon him to write or convey at that time,
because if that were the case, he ( g ) would not have ignored what
AUah had commanded him to do. Rather that was something that he
saw fit to do, so as to ward off dispute concerning the caliphate of
Abn Bakr, as he thought that disputes would inevitably arise."537
Elsewhere, he said: "As for the story of the document that the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) wanted to write, that was explained as is
narrated in Bukhari and Muslim from 'A'ishah (I&,), who said: The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said when he was sick: "d&l your father and
your brother for me, so that I may write a document, for I fear that
someone might wish (for succession) and say 'I am more entitled to
it,' when AUah and the believers will not accept anyhody hut Ahu
B*,m538
Then after quoting the reports of the hadith, Ibn Taymiyah
had decided to write the document that he
said: "The Prophet (g)
mentioned to 'kishah (I&,), hut when he saw that confusion had
arisen, he realised that whting the document would not dispel the
confusion, so there was no benefit in writing it. He also realised that
Allah ( B )would unite them on what he intended, as he said: "AUah
and the believers will not accept anyhody but Abu ~ a k r . " ~ ~ ~
As for the words in the hadith, "you will never go astray after I
am gone," ad-Dahlawi said in his interpretation of the hadith: "If it is
said: if what he intended to write was not about religious affairs, why

208

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib in Makkah

did he say you will never go astray after me? We say: Misguidance
has many aspects, and what is meant here is not making mistakes
with regard to running the affairs of state, which is expelling the
polytheists from the Arabian Peninsula, rewarding the delegations as
he used to reward them and preparing and sending the army of
U s h a h . It does not refer to misguidance and going astray from the
religion."540

3. Concerning the meaning of the words of Ibu 'Abbss, 'The real
calamity is that which prevented the Messenger of Allah (&) from
writing that document,"541as Ibn Taymiyah said with regard to what
was meant: It means that the thing that prevented it was a calamity for
those who doubted the caliphate of Abu Bakr and were confused
about the matter. If there was a document, it would have dispelled
their doubts. But as for those who knew that his caliphate was true, it
was not a calamity for them, praise be to ~ l l a h . 5 ~ '
What explains that is the fact that Ibn 'Abbb (&) only said that
after the emergence of the people who followed whims and desires
and innovations, such as the Kharijites and Rsfidis. This was stated
by Ibn ~ a ~ r n i ~ and
h 'Ibn
~ ~~ a j a r . 5 ~ ~

4. As for their claims that the Prophet (B)intended in this document
to state that 'Ali (&) should he the caliph, and the claim of some of
the R Z d i s that there is no other rational interpretation, this claim is
false.
Ibn Taymiyah said: "Whoever thinks that this document was to
appoint 'Ali(&) as the caliph is misguided according to all scholars,
both Sunni and Shia. As for the Snnnis, they are agreed on the
superiority of Abu Bakr (&) and that he should be given
precedence. As for those who said that 'Ali (&) was deserving of
the imamate, they say that his imamate had already been stated before
that, as they claim, in clear and unambiguous terms, so there was no
need for this document."545

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

209

5. As for the RZfidis' slander against 'Umar (&) and their claim that
he accused the Messenger of Allah (@) of not knowing what he was
saying, as he said "he is delirious," and he did not comply with what
the Prophet (g)
wanted, and he said "you have the Book of Allah"
and "the Book of Allah is sufficient for us", the response to that is
that the first claim, which is that 'Umar (&) accused the Messenger
of Allah of being delirious and not aware of what he was saying is
false, because this phrase, "is he delirious?" is not proven to be the
words of 'Umar (4)
in the fxst place. Rather these are the words of
one of the people who were present, but the reports narrated in
Bukhari and Muslim do not specify who said it. What is proven is
that they said, "What is the matter with him? Is he delirious?"546 It
appears thus, in the plural, not the singular, hence some of the
scholars said that these were not the words of 'Umar (&). Ibn Hajar
said: "It seems to me that the third possibility is most likely, which
was mentioned by al-Qumbi, and that the one who said that was one
of those who had recently become Muslim. It is common for one who
is faced with severe pain to be distracted by the pain from canying
out what he wants to do."547 Al-Dahlawi said: "How can it be proven
that the one who said these words was 'Umar, when in most reports it
appears in the plural ('they said')?"548
What is proven with regard to this phrase is that it came in the
form of a question ("is he delirious?"). This is unlike what is
mentioned in some reports, where it says "he was delirious" and the
like, which is less likely to be the case according to the conclusions of
those scholars and hadith commentators who examined the matter,
such as al-Q2& ' 1 ~ 2 d ~a l~- ~~ ,u ~ f l l hai n~-~~~a ,w a w i ~and
~ ' Ibn
~ a j a r . ~They
"
stated that the interrogative form here is indicative of
objection to those who said: "Do not write (the document).,2553 Al_
QuTfllbi quoted the evidence that the Prophet (g)
was infallible and
was protected against making mistakes in conveying the message in

I

210

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib in Makkah

all situations, which was well-established among the Companions.
Based on this, it was impossible that their words "is he delirious?"
would indicate any doubt on their part about the soundness of what
he was saying at the time of sickness. Rather that was said by some of
them by way of objecting to those who hesitated to bring the shoulder
blade and inkpot and delayed doing so. It is as if they were saying to
those who were hesitant: 'How could you hesitate? Do you think that
he is rambling? Stop hesitating and brlng the shoulder blade, for he
speaks the truth and is not delirious.' This is the best
iute~pretation.~'~
This indicates that the Companions were
unanimously agreed that it was impossible for the Messenger of
Allah (&) to be delirious, because those who said that mentioned it in
the context of objecting to those who hesitated, who nevertheless
knew that he was not delirious. Thus the R%i@ claims are proven
false and ha~eless.~''
6 . Let us examine their claim that 'Umar (&) objected to the
Messenger of Allah (gg)by saying: "You have the Book of Allah; the
Book of Allah is sufficient for us," and that he did not obey the
command of the Messenger of Allah ($gJwith regard to what he
wanted of writing the document. The response to the specious
arguments is that it became clear to 'Umar (&), and those of the
Companions who shared his opinion, that the Prophet's command to
write the document was not by way of obligation; instead, he was
guiding them to that which was better. This was pointed out by alQi& "Ayid 556, a l - ~ w b557,
i a n - ~ a w a i i and Ibn ~ a j a r . ~ ' ~
Moreover, after this, it was proven that 'Umar's opinion was correct,
because the Messenger (&) decided not to write the document.
If it had been obligatory, he would not have abandoned the
idea because of their difference of opinion concerning it, because he
did not fail to convey anything due to the objection of anyone. Hence
this is regarded as one of the issues in which 'Umar's opinion

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

21 1

coincided with the t n ~ t h . ~Similarly,
~O
the words of 'Umar (&>),
"The Book of AlJah is sufficient for us" are addressed to those who
disagreed with him, and he did not say that by way of objecting to the
command of the Prophet (g).
This is clear from his words, "You
have the Book of Allah." These words are addressed to those who
disagreed with 'Umar's opinion, using the plural form of 'you'.
Moreover, 'Umar (&) was farsighted and possessed deep
insight and wisdom. He thought that it was more appropriate not to
write the document after he became certain that the command here
was not in the sense of being obl&atory and that not writing the
document would serve some clear Sharia interest. The scholars had
many views as to what Sharia interest 'Umar (&) may have had in
mind, and there are a number of opinions. One view is that it was
compassion on 'Umar's part for the Messenger of Allah (g)
because
of the hardship that writing the document might cause for him when
he was so ill. This is borne out by his words: "The Messenger of
All% was overcome by pain, so he did not want to burden the
Messenger of Allah (g)
with something that was difficult and hard
to dons6', bearing in mind the verses in which Allah (&) says: (we
have neglected nothing in the B O O ~ B(Qur'an 6: 38) and (And We
have sent down to you the Book [the Qur'an] as an exposition of
everything.B (Qur'an 16: 89)
An-Nawawi said: As for the words of 'Umar (&), the
scholars who commented on the hadith are unanimously agreed that
this is one of the signs of 'Umar's deep understanding, virtues and
profound insight.562
Similarly, 'Umar (&) based his view on what he thought was
best with regard to writing the document, and the one who tries his
best to understand an issue of Islam and come up with an answer is
excused (regardless of whether he gets it right or wrong); rather he is
rewarded, because of the words of the Prophet (B):
"If the judge

212

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib in Makkah

passes judgement and strives hard and gets it right, he will have two
rewards; if he strives hard and gets it wrong, he will have one
reward."563 So how about if 'Umar (&) tried hard to work it out in
the presence of the Messenger of Allah (g),
and he did not tell him
he was wrong or criticise him; rather he agreed with what he wanted,
which was not to write the document. Thus it is clear that this slander
of the R=dis against the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them) on the basis of this incident is false and baseless, and this
highlights the invalidity of what they said about them.564

CHAPTER TWO

'Ali ibn Abi Tslib (&) at the time of
the Rightly Guided Caliphs

1. 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib -(&) at the time
of Abu Bakr a$-Sideeq (&)
1.1.'Ali's oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr as
caliph (may Allah be pleased with them both)
%ere
are many reports about the delay in 'Ali's swearing
allegiance to Abu Bakr (&), as well as az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh's
delay in doing so, but most of these reports are not sound. There are
sound reports stating that 'Ali and az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased
with them both) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Sideeq (&) in the
beginning. It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) said:
When the Messenger of AUah (@) died, the spokesmen of the An&
stood up ... and he went on to mention bay 'at as-saqeefah.' Then he
said: Then they departed, and when Abu Bakr sat on the minbar, he
looked at the faces of the people. He did not see 'Ali (&I,
so he
asked about him, and some of the Ansir went and brought him. Abu
Bakr (&) said: "0cousin and son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah
(g)do,you want to cause division among the Muslims?" He said:
"Let there be no reproach, 0 successor of the Messenger of Allah
(g),"
and he swore allegiance to him. Then he did not see az-Zubayr
ibn al-'Awwgm (&), SO he asked about him until they brought him,

214

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

and he said: "0 cousin and disciple of the Messenger of Allah (g),
do you want to cause division among the Muslims?" He said
likewise: "Let there be no reproach, 0 successor of the Messenger of
Allah
and he swore allegiance to him.2

m),"

One indication of the importance of the sound hadith of Abu
Sa'eed al-Khudri is that Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjij, the author of
Saheeh Muslim, which is the soundest of the hadith books after
Saheeh al-Bukhari, went to his Shaykh, al-H%& Muhammad ibn
Ishiq ibn Khuzaymah, the author of Saheeh Ibn Khuzaymah, and
asked him about this hadith. Ibn Khuzaymah wrote the badith down
for him and read it to him. Then Muslim said to his Shaykh, Ibn
Khuzaymah: "This hadith is as valuable as a camel (meaning very
valuable)." Ibn Khuzaymah said: 'This hadith is not only equal to a
camel;' rather it is equal to a sack4 of treasure." Ibn Katbeer (may
Allah have mercy on him) commented on this hadith by saying:
"This is a sound, mahfoo& chain of narration, and it is of great
importance, namely the ailegiance of 'Ali ibn Abi TSb (&) on
This
.
either the first or second day after the death of the Prophet (gj
is true, because 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) did not stay away from Abu
Bakr (4)
at any time, and he did not miss any prayer that was
offered behind him."5 According to the report of Habeeb ibn Abi
Thibit: 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&) was in his house, and a man came to
him and told him: Abu Bakr (4)
is sitting to receive the oath of
allegiance. 'Ali (&) went out to the mosque, wearing a chemise of
his, with no upper or lower garment, mshing for fear of any delay in
swearing his oath of allegiance. He swore allegiance to Abu Bakr
(&), then he sat down and sent for his upper garment (or cloak),
which they brought to him and be put on over his c h e m i ~ e . ~

'Amr ibn Hurayth asked Sa'eed ibn Zayd (&): 'When was
allegiance sworn to Abu Bakr (&)?" Sa'eed said: "The day the
Messenger of Allah (g)
died, the Muslims did not want to remain for

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

215

even part of a day without being united." He said: "Did anyone
oppose Abu Bakr (&)?' Sa'eed said: "No, no one went against him
except an apostate or one who was planning to become an apostate.
Allah
saved the An@, so they rallied behind him and swore
allegiance to him." He said: "Did anyone among the Mujihireen
refrain from swearing allegiance to him?" Sa'eed said: "No, the
Muhgjireen came one after another to swear allegiance to him."7

(s)

Among the things that 'Ali (&) said to Ibn al-Kawwa' and
Qays ibn 'Ahh?id, when he came to Basra and they asked him about
his journey, was: "If I had any covenant with the Prophet (B),I
would not have left the man of Bann Taym ibn Murrah [i.e., Abu
Bakr (&)I and 'Umar ibn al-Kha@h (&) standing on his (the
Prophet's) minbar. I would have fought them, even if I had nothing
with which to fight except this cloak of mine. But the Messenger of
Allah (gg)
was not murdered and did not die suddenly; he remained
sick for several days and nights, during which the muezzin would
come to tell him about the prayer, and he would order Ahn Bakr
to lead the people in prayer, when he could see where I was. One of
his wives wanted to divert that from Abu Bakr (&),
. . but he refused
and got angry, saying: 'You are like the women around Yusnf! Tell
Ahu Bakr (&)
. .. to lead the people in prayer.' When Allah (&) took
the soul of His Prophet, we discussed our situation, and we chose for
our worldly affairs the one whom the Prophet of Allah (&) wanted.
Prayer is the basis of Islam, the most important of affairs and the
pillar of the faith. So we swore allegiance to Abn Bakr (&), who
was qualified for that, and no two people among us differed
concerning him. I did my duty towards Abu Bakr (&) and obeyed
him. I went out on campaign with him as one of his troops and
accepted what he gave me. I went out on campaign if he asked me to,
and I canied out hadd punishments in f'ront of him with my whip."8

(4)

Among the things that 'Ali (&) said on the minbar of Kufah,
praising Abu Ba!u and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them),,

216

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

was: "The Muslims gave their allegiance willingly, and the first one
to do that among the sons of 'Abdul-Muywih was me."9 There are
reports indicating that 'Ali (&) swore allegiance to Ahu Bakr (&)
right away, even though they do not state that clearly. It was narrated
from Ibriiheem ibn 'Abdur-Ra!xnk ibn 'Awf that he said: "AbdurRa?m~i?tnihn 'Awf (&) was with 'Umar ibn al-Khatfib (&), then
Abu Bakr (&>) stood up and addressed the people, explaining to
them: 'By Allah, I was never eager for leadership at all. I never had
any desire for it, and I never asked Allah
for it, in private or in
public. But I was afraid of$tnah.1° I have no pleasure in the position
of leadership, hut I have been appointed to a very important position,
for which I have no ability except by the help of Allah (&). I wish
that the strongest of people who could bear it would he in my position
today.' The Muhijiroon accepted his words and his explanation.

(s)

'Ali and az-Zubayr said: 'The only thing that disappointed us
was that we were not consulted, hut we believe that Ahu Bakr (&) is
the most qualified of the people for it after the Messenger of Allah
(g).
He was his companion in the cave and the second of two, and
we know of his honourable position and seniority. The Messenger of
Allah
commanded him to lead the people in prayer when he was
still alive."'" And it was narrated that Qays al-'Abdi said: "I
witnessed the sermon of 'Ali (&) on the day of Basra. He praised
and glorified Allah (&). He mentioned the Prophet (g),
how he
guided the people and how Allah (&) took him to Himself. Then he
mentioned that the Muslims decided to appoint as his successor Abu
Bakr (&),
. ., so they swore allegiance to him, gave their pledge to him
and accepted his leadership. He said: I swore allegiance to him, gave
my pledge to him and accepted his leadership. They were pleased,
and I was pleased. He did well and strove hard until Allah (%) took
his soul, may Allah (&) have mercy on him."12
"

a)

'ALi did not stay away from Abu Bakr (&) at any time, and he
never stayed away from him in any gathering. He joined with him in

illi ibn Abi Ttlib

21 7

consultation and running the aFfairs of the Muslims. Ihn Katheer and
a number of scholars narrated that 'Ali (&) renewed his oath of
allegiance six months after the fust oath, after the death of Fitimah
($+I, and there are sound reports about this. l 3 When the second oath
of allegiance took place, some narrators thought that 'Ali (&) had
not sworn allegiance before that, so they denied the earlier pledge.
However, what is proven takes precedence over what is denied.I4
There is a book entitled al-Imam 'Ali Jadal al-Haqeeqah walMuslimeen - al-Wa~iyyahwash-Shoora (Imam 'Ali, the Truth and
the Mnslims - Instructions Regarding the Succession and
Consultation), by Mamoud Muhammad alLCAli.Its author claimed
to be researching and seeking the truth, hut he could not rid himself
of the Shia Rifia approach when discussing this issue. He put poison
in the honey, as it were, and we must point it out. He discussed 'Ali's
oath of allegiance and said that 'Ali's right to the caliphate was based
on the instructions of the Prophet (gg).
~.

1.2. 'Ali (&) and his support for Abu Bakr (&)
during the Wars of Apostasy
'Ali (&) was a sincere adviser to Ahn Bakr (&), prefening
that which was in the best interests of Islam and the Muslims to
anything else. There are many signs of his sincerity to Ahu Bakr
(&), to Islam and to the Muslims, and of his keenness to protect the
position of the caliphs and to uphold Muslim unity. One clear sign is
his advice when he heard that Abu Bakr (&) was determined to go
to fight the apostates in Dhul-Qi~sah and to lead the military
campaign against them himself. 'Ali (&) recognised the danger that
this posed to the survival of slam.'^ It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar
that 'Ali (&) said [to Abu Bakr]: "I shall say to you what the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said on the day of Ulpd: 'Keep your sword
sheathed, and do not cause us grief by your loss.' Go back to

(4)

218

'Ali ibn Ahi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Madinah, for by Allah, if we were to lose you, Islam would never
prosper after that." Abn Bakr (&) went back.16
If 'Ali (&)
had been discontented with Abu Balcr's caliphate
,.
and had given his oath of allegiance reluctantly - though he is far
above any such suggestion - this would have been a golden
opportunity for him to take advantage of. He could have let Abu Bakr
(&) do what he wanted, in the hope that he would be harmed, and
then he would have been rid of him and would have had no obstacles
in his way. If his hatred had been even worse than that -Allah (&)
forbid - and he was very keen to get rid of him, he could have
enticed someone to assassinate him, as politicians do to their
competitors and enemies." 'Ali's opinion was that the apostates
should be fought, and when Abu Bakr (&) asked him what he
thought, he said: "I think that if you leave anything that the
Messenger of Allah (@Jused to take from them, then you will not be
following the Sunnah of the Messenger." Abu Bakr (&) said: "If
you think that, then I shall certainly fight them, even if they withhold
from me a rope (that was used for hobbling camels)."

1.3. 'Ali regarded Abu Bakr (&) as being
of a higher position than anyone else
There are many reports from 'Ali (&) indicating that he
preferred and gave precedence to Abu B & - ( 4 ) . For example:

1.

It was narrated that M&ammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: "I said
to my father: 'Which of the people is best after the Messenger
of Allah (g)?
He said: 'Abu B&.' I said: 'Then who?' He
said: "Umar.' I was afraid that he would say 'Uthmgn next, so
I said: 'Then you?' He said: 'I am just one of the M~slims.'"'~

2.

It was narrated that 'Ali (&) said: "Shall I not tell you of the
Abu Bakr (&)."
best of this Ummah after its Prophet (g)?
,.

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

219

Then he said: "Shall I not tell you of the best of this Ummah
after Abu Bakr (&)? 'Umar (&)."19
..

3.

It was narrated that Abu W2il Shaqeeq ibn Salamah said: It
was said to 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&): "Why don't you appoint
someone over us?" (meaning someone to rule after he was
gone) He said: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
did not appoint
anyone to succeed him so that I should appoint anyone to
succeed me, but if Allah
wills good for the people, then
He will unite them behind the best of them after I am gone, as
He united them behind the best of them after their Prophet (g)
was gone."z0

(s)

4.

'Ali (&) said: "I will not be brought anyone who gives me
precedence over Abu Bakr and 'Umar, but that I will carry out
the hadd punishment of the fabricator on him.""

5.

'Ali said to Abu Sufyin (&): "We found that Abu Bakr (&I
was most qualified for it."

There are reports which further highlight the good relationship
between 'Ali and Abu Bakr, such as the following:
(a) It was narrated that 'Uqbah ibn al-Hzth said: "I went out
with Abu Bakr (&) after 'Asr prayer a few days after the
Prophet (g)
died, and 'Ali (&) was walking beside him.
He passed by Hasan ibn 'Ali, who was playing with some
boys, and he canied himon his shoulder, saying: 'May my
father be sacrifced for the one who looks like the Prophet
but he does not look like 'Ali.' And 'Ali laughed."22
(b) It was narrated that 'Ali(&) said: "Whoever moves a
hand span away from the main body of Muslims has gone
beyond the pale of slam."^^ Could 'Mi (&) have moved
away from the other Muslims? He (&) hated division and
was very keen for unity. A l - Q w b i said: "Whoever

220

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

ponders what happened between Abu Bakr and 'Ali when
discussing differences and various points of view, which
highlighted their total agreement, will realise that they
acknowledged one another's virtues and their hearts were
filled with love and respect for one another. Even though
human nature may sometimes influence one's attitude,
religious commitment cancels that out, and Allah is the
source of strength."24
As for what was said about az-Znbayr ibn a l - ' A w w h (&)
delaying swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (&), it was never
narrated by any sound chain of narration; rather there are reports that
denied this and prove that he did swear allegiance to him straight
away. This appears in the sound reports of Abu Sa'eed and others.z5
(c) Ibn Taymiyah said: There are so many reports that they
reached the level of mutawitir, and they state that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (4)
said: "The best of this
Ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then 'Umar." This
was narrated from him through many chains of narration;
it was said that there were eighty such chains. It was also
narrated from him that he said: "I will not be brought
anyone who gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and
'Umar, but that I will cany out the hadd punishment of the
fabricator on him."26 He also said: "No one ever said that
he was more entitled to this (meaning the caliphate) than
Abu Bala; and no specific person said that anyone was
more entitled to it than Abu Bakr, rather one who still had
a trace of Arabian or Persian j m y y a h in him said that the
household of the Messenger (&) was more deserving of
leadership. This is because the Arabs used to give
precedence to the households of the rulers during their
j2hiliyyah; similarly, the Persians gave precedence to the

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

221

household of the king. Thus words to that effect were
narrated from people of that ilk.""
(d) Calling Abu Bakr 'as-Sideeq' and testifying to his
preeminence and courage. It was narrated that Y&ya ibn
Hakeem ihn Sa'd said: "I heard 'Ali (&) swearing an
oath by Allah (s)
that the name of Abu Bakr (+$) came
down from heaven: aS-~ideeq."28It was also narrated that
Silah ihn Zafar al-'Absi said: "Abu Bakr (&) was
mentioned in the presence of 'Ali (&), and he said: 'Are
you mentioning the name of the one who has precedence?
By the One in Whose hand is my soul, we never competed
in doing good but Ahu Bakr (&) surpassed us."'29 And it
was narrated that Muhammad ihn 'Aqeel ibn Ahi wib
said: " 'Ali (4)
addressed us and said: '0 people, who is
the bravest of the people?' We said: 'Yon, 0 Amir alMu'mineen.' 'Ali said: 'Rather it is Ahu Bakr as-Sideeq,
because on the day of Badr, we built the hut for the
Messenger of Allah (g),
then we said: "Who will stand
with him so that none of the polytheists will get close to
him?" No one stood with him except Ahu Bakr (&), who
stood with his sword unsheathed, guarding the Prophet
(g);
every time anyone got close to him, Ahu Bakr (&)
struck him with his sword. I saw the Messenger of k a h
(g)
when Quraysh caught hold of him at the Ka'hah and
started shaking him and saying: "You are the one who
made the gods into one God." By Allah, no one got close
to him except Abu Bakr (&), and at that time Ahu Bakr
(&) had two braids. He started poking this one and
pushing that one, saying: 'Woe to you! Would you kill a
man because he says my Lord is Allah (B),
when be has
brought you proof from your Lord?" One of Ahu Bakr's
braids was cut off, and 'Ali (&)
. . said to his companions:

222

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib at the time ofthe Rightly Guided Caliphs

'I adjure you by Allah (&), which of the two men was
better, the believer of the family of Pharaoh or Abu Bakr?'
The people kept quiet, then 'Ali (&) said: 'By Allah, a
day in the life of Abu Bakr (&) is better than the believer
of the family of Pharaoh; that man conceded his faith, and
Allah (&)praised him, but Abu Bakr (&) offered his life
and his blood for the sake of Allah (&)."'30

1.4. 'Ali following Abu Bakr (&) in prayer
and accepting gdts from him
'Ali (&) accepted the caliphate of Abu Bakr (&) and took
part in his managing the affairs of the Ummah. He accepted gifts
from him, referred cases to him for judgement, prayed behind him,
loved him and bated those who hated him.31 That is confirmed even
by the greatest opponent of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, of the
and of those who followed their
Companions of the Prophet (g)
guidance and adhered to their way:3Zthe extremist Shia d-Ya'qoobi.
In his Tareekh, he mentions the caliphate of Abu Bakr (&) and says:
"Abu Bakr wanted to launch a campaign against the Byzantines, so
he consulted a number of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
(g),
but they had different views. Then he consulted 'Ali ibn Abi
Tilib, who suggested that he should do it, saying: 'If you do it, you
will prevail.' Abu Bakr (&) said: 'You have cheered me up.' So
Abu Bakr stood up to address the people and commanded them to
prepare themselves for a campaign against the Byzantines.
According to another report, Abu Balcr asked 'Ali: 'On what basis
did you give me these glad tidings?' He said: 'From the Prophet (gJ,
when I heard him give these glad tidings.' Abu Bakr said: 'You have
cheered me up by telling me what you heard from the Messenger of
Allah @), 0 Abu d-Hasan; may AUah cheer you

'Ali ibn Abi T&ib

223

Al-Ya'qoobi also said: "Among those from whom Islamic
jurisprudence was learned during the time of Ahu Bakr were 'Ali ibn
Abi Tilib, 'Umar ihn al-KhatJZb, Mu'Zdh ihn Jabal, Ubayy ibn Ka'h,
Zayd ibn ThZhit and Ahdullah ibn ~ a s ' o o d . "Abu
~ ~Bakr (&) gave
precedence to 'Ali (&) out of all his companions. This is a clear
indication that they used to deal with one another and give
precedence to 'Ali(&)
, ., with regard to seeking advice35and referting
matters forjudgement. At one time, a delegation of disbelievers came
to Madinah. They noticed some weakness in the Muslims and saw
that they were small in number because many of them had gone in
different directions for jihad to uproot the apostates and evil
wrongdoers. Abu Bakr (&) sensed that they posed a danger to the
capital of Islam and to the Muslims, so he ordered that Madinah be
placed under guard, and he appointed troops to protect its gates and
watch out for approaching armies. He appointed 'Ali, az-Zubayr,
Tabah and Abdullah ihn Mas'ood (may AUah be pleased with them)
in charge of these guards, and they remained like that until they felt
they were safe from the threat.36
There was constant interaction between Abu Bakr and 'Ali
(may Allah be pleased with them both), as well as friendship and
complete harmony. Thus 'Ali (&), who was the head of Ah1 al-Bayt
and the father of the two grandsons of the Messenger (g),
used to
accept presents and gifts, as is the habit of brothers who treat one
another on an equal footing and love one another. He accepted (as a
gift) as-Suhba', the slave woman who was captured during the Battle
of 'Ayn at-Tamr, and she bore him 'Umar and ~ u ~ a ~Abu
~ a h . ~ ~
Bakr (&) also gave him Khawlah bint Ja'far ibn Qays, who was one
of the captives taken during the Battle of al-Yamhab; she bore him
the best of his children after al-Hasan and al-Husayn, namely
M&ammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. Khawlah was one of the female
captives from the war against the apostates, and her son Muhammad
ibn al-Hanafiyyah was named after her and attributed to her.38

224

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Imam al-Juwayni says concerning the allegiance of the
Companions to Abu Bakr (&): "They all accepted the authority of
Abu Bakr (&), and 'Ali (&) used to hear his command and obey.
He swore allegiance to Abu B a h (&) in front of many people and
joined his army in the campaign to Banu ~ a n e e f a h . " ' ~

There are numerous reports about him and his sons accepting
financial gifts, the one-fifth share and wealth of the fay' (booty
acquired without fighting) from Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased
with them all). 'Ali was in charge of distributing the booty at the time
of Abu Bakr (&). This wealth was under 'Ali's control, then it was
under the control of al-Hasan, then of al-Husayn, then of al-Hasan
ibn al-Hasan, then of Zayd ibn a l - ~ a s a n'Ali
.~~
used to offer the
five daily prayers in the mosque behind Abu Bakr (&), accepting
him as an imam in prayer and demonstrating to the people the extent
to which he was in agreement and harmony with him.41

(4)

'ALi (&) narrated some hadiths of the Messenger
.
of Allah
(g)
from Abu Bakr. It was narrated that Asma' bint al-Hakam alsaid: "I heard 'Ali (&) say: 'If I heard something from the
Messenger of Allah (g)
by which AUah ( B )benefited me, I would
ask him (the narrator) to swear (that he heard it from the Prophet),
and if he swore, I would believe him. Abu Bakr (&) told me - and
Abu Bakr told the truth: "I heard the Messenger of AUah (gJ
say:
'There is no Muslim who commits a sin and then does wudoo' and
does it well, then prays two raka'ahs and asks Allah to forgive him,
but AUah will forgive him."""4z
~

F L ~

When the Messenger of Allah (g)
died, his Companions
differed over where he should be buried. Some of them said to
bury him in Baqee' Cemetery, others said to bury him in the place
for funerals, and still others said to bury him where his
Companions were buried. Abu Bakr (&) said: "Keep quiet, for
voices should not be raised in the presence of the Prophet (@),

alive or dead." 'Ali (&) said: "Abu Bakr has something to say,
which he was entrusted with." Abu Bakr said: "The Messenger
told me that there is no prophet who dies, but he is buried where
he died."43
'Ali (4)
testified to the great reward of 'Abu Bakr (&) with
regard to collecting the Qur'an into one volume. It was narrated that
'Abd Khayr said: "I heard 'Ali
say: 'The greatest of the people
in reward with regard to the mu&f 44 is Abu Bakr as-Sideeq; he was
the first one who collected it between two covers."'45

(4)

1.5. Abu Bakr (&), Fsfimah (&,) and the
estate of the Prophet (g)
'kishah (%) said: "Fitimah and al-Abbh (may Allah be
pleased with themboth) came to Abu Ba!u
asking for their
inheritance from the Messenger of Allah ( g ) , mentioning his land in
Fadak and his share of Khaybar. Abu Bakr (&) said to them: 'I
heard the Messenger of Allah (g)
say: We prophets are not inherited
from; what we leave behind is charity. Rather the provision of the
family of ~ u h a m m a d(@) should come from this ~ e a l t h . " ' ~
According to another report, Abu Bakr (&) said: "I am not going to
leave anything that the Messenger of Allah ( g ) used to do but I will
do it too, because I am afraid that if I leave anything that he used to
do, I will go astray."47

(4)

It was narrated that 'kishah (I$&,) said that when the
Messenger of Allah (g)
died, the wives of the Prophet (g)
wanted
to send 'Uthmk ibn
(&) to Abu Bakr (&) to ask him for
their inheritance from the Prophet (@J. 'A'ishah (I&,) said to them:
"Didn't the Messenger of Allah (&) say: 'We prophets are not
inherited from; what we leave behind is charity'?"48 It was narrated
that Abu Hurayrah (&) said: "The Messenger of AUah (g)
said:

'Af%

226

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

'My heirs should not share out any dinar that I leave behind.
Whatever I have left, after the maintenance of my wives and the
remuneration of my agent, is charity."'49
Ahu Bakr as-Sideeq (4)
followed these instructions with
regard to F2timah (I&), in obedience to the words of the Prophet
(g).
Hence Ahu B& (&) said: "I am not going to leave anything
that the Messenger of Allah (g)
used to do, hut I will do it too."50
And he said: "By Allah, I will not leave anything that I saw the
Messenger of Allah do, but I will do it too."51
F2cirnah (%) stopped disputing with him after he quoted this
hadith and explained the matter to her. This is evidence that she
accepted the truth of what he said. Ibn ~ u t a ~ b a hsaid:
"
"As for the
dispute of F2timah (I&) with Abu Bakr (may AUah he pleased with
them both) concernin; the inheritance of the Prophet (g),
this was
not something strange, because she did not know what the Messenger
of Allah (g)
had said, and she thought that she would inherit from
him as children inherit from their fathers. When Ahu Bakr told her
what the Prophet had said, she gave up her demand."53
The Riifidis went to extremes with regard to the story of the
inheritance of the Prophet
They drifted away from the truth,
turning away from and ignoring the sound reports stating that he (g)
was not to be inherited from. They made it one of the foundations of
the differences between the Companions and Ah1 al-Bayt (may Allah
be pleased with them all) and an extension of the issue of the
caliphate. They accused the Companions (especially Ahu Bakr asSideeq and 'Umar al-Farooq) of mistreating and being unfair to Ahl
al-Bayt. They alleged that these two seized the caliphate by force
from Ah1 al-Bayt and then confiscated their wealth and all of the
financial rights that Allah
had enjoined for them. The R%$s
regard the issue of Fadak and denying F2timah (I$&) her inheritance
as one of the most serious issues in which the ~o&&inionsconspired

(s).

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

227

after Abu Bakr (4)seized the caliphate from them by force,
according to their claim. They argue that he kept the inheritance from
them to prevent the people from becoming inclined towards Ah1 alBayt because of this wealth, lest they unite against him and dismiss
him from the caliphate.54
The one who checks this matter in the R Z d i books will find
that they focus on denying the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (@I:
"We prophets are not inherited from; what we leave behind is
charity."55 They try to show that it is false by producing evidence
such as the following:

1.

They claimed that this hadith was fabricated by Abu B a h a$Sideeq (&). With regard to that, al-Hilli said: " F i i ~ a hdid not
accept the hadith fabricated by Abu Bakr (&3 when he said:
'...what we leave behind is charity."' He also said: "He resorted
to quoting a report that no one else narrated."56 Al-Majlisi said,
after stating that Abu Bakr and 'Umar seized Fadak: "For that
purpose, they fabricated this evil and false report, 'We prophets
are not inherited from; what we leave behind is ~harity."'~'
Khomeini said concerning that: "We say that the hadith which is
amibuted to the Prophet is not valid, and that it was said in order
to eliminate the progeny of the Prophet."58
The response to that is that these statements are pure lies and
obvious fabrications, because this report was not narrated by
Abu Bakr (&) only. Rather the words of the Prophet (&), "We
prophets are not inherited from; what we leave behind is
charity" were narrated from him by Abu Bakr, 'Uthmh, 'Ali,
Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa'd, 'Abdur-Rahmh ibn 'Awf, al-'Abhb
ibn 'Abdul-Muttalib, the wives of the Prophet, Abu Hnrayrah
and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamk (may Allah be pleased with them
all).59 Concerning that, Ibn Taymiyah said: "The report from
these people is proven in the books of Saheeh and the Musmds,

228

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

and it is well known to the scholars of hadith. The one who says
that Abu Bakr (&) was the only one who narrated this report is
proving that he is extremely ignorant or is deliberately lying."60
Ibn Katheer said, after mentioning those who narrated the
hadith: "This claim of the RifiGs is false. If Abn Bakr (&) was
the only one who narrated the hadith, all the people of earth
would still be obliged to accept his narrati~n."~'Dr. Sulaym2n
ibn Raja' as-Suhaymi, the author of the valuable book al'Aqeedahfi Ah1 al-Bayt bayna al-Zfrdtwa't-Tafreet said: "This is
supported by what is narrated in the books of the RZfidis from
Imam Ja'far q-Szdiq, the fifth infallible Imam according to
them, as narrated from him by al-Kulayni, as-SaEir and alMufeed, according to whom he said: The Messenger of Allah
(g)
said: 'Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge thereby,
Allah will make easy for him a path to paradise. The scholars are
krnstees, the pious are fortresses and the twelve Imams are
masters. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is
like the superiority of the moon over all the other heavenly
bodies on a night when it is full. The scholars are the heirs of the
Prophets; they did not leave any dinars or dirhams to be inherited
from them, rather they left behind knowledge, and whoever
acquires any of it has got a good deal.'62 According to another
report: 'The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, because the
Prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, rather they left
behind their savings in their h a d i t h ~ . " ' ~ ~

2. They claimed that this hadith was contrary to the words of Allah,
(Allah commands you as regards your children's [inheritance]:
to the male, a portion equal to that of two females.) (Qur'an 4:
11) They said: "Allah did not make this only for the Ummah in
exclusion of him ($$3)i)."64
In fact, this verse is addressed to those whom it is meant to

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

229

address, and there is nothing in the verse to suggest that the
Prophet
is necessarily one of those who are addressed
here.65 he Prophet (g)
is not to be compared to any other
human being, because he is closer to the believers than their own
selves and because Allah (&) has forbidden to him charity, both
obligatory and voluntary. There are things that apply exclusively
for which AUah has singled him out. He and his
to him (g)?
fellow prophets (peace he upon them) are not to be inherited
from, and this is protection from Allah so that there will be no
reason for anyone to criticise them on the grounds that they only
sought worldly gains for themselves and their heirs. As for the
rest of mankind, they do not have that position of prophethood
that could he undermined by the issue of inheritance. In a similar
from being
way, Allah ( B )also protected our Prophet (g)
literate or a poet, so as to eliminate any doubt about his
prophethood, but others did not need this type of protection.66

a)

Ibn Katheer said, refuting the RSfi@s' use of this verse as
evidence: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
had special mlings that
applied only to him, which the other Prophets did not share. If
we assume that other prophets could be inherited from, which is
not the case, then what was narrated by the Companions,
especially Abu Bakr (&), demonstrates that this d i n g applies
only to him to the exclusion of the others."67 Thus it is clear that
their claim is false and conto the hadith.
3.

They claim that the prohibition on inheritance and quoting of
this hadith as evidence is contrary to the words of AUah,'@And
Sulaymin [Solomon] inherited [the knowledge ofl Dzwood
pavid],) (Qur'an 27: 16) and that it is contrary to what Allah
(&) said concerning His Prophet Zakariya ( M ) :(And verily, I
fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me
from Yourself an heir, who shall inherit me, and inherit [also] the

230

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

posterity of Ya'qoob [Jacob] [inheritance of the religious
knowledge and prophethood, not of wealth]. And make him, my
Lord, one with whom Yon are well-pleased!) (Qur'an 19: 5-6)
They said: "Inheritance implies wealth and the like, and no one
can say that what is meant in the verse is knowledge and not
wealth."68
L
The response is that the word 'inheritance' is a generic word that
includes many meanings. It may be used with regard to inherited
knowledge, prophethood, kingship or other things that can be
transferred. The following verses refer to nothing more than the
generic meaning of inheritance; they do not indicate inheritance
of wealth:
#Then We gave the Book [the Qur'an] as inheritance to such of
Our slaves whom We chose.) (Qur'an 35: 32)
#These are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit the Firdaws
[paradise]. They shall dwell therein forever.), (Qur2an23: 10-11)
#And Sulaymk [Solomon]inherited [the knowledge of] Diwood
[Davidlh (Qur'an 27: 16). Diwood had many other children
besides Sulaymk, and Sulaymk cannot have been singled out
to inherit his wealth, which indicates that what is meant by
inheritance here is inheritance of knowledge, prophethood and
so on, and not inheritance of wealth. The context of this verse is
praise for Sulaymk and the blessings for which Allah (&&)
singled him out. There is no particular virtue in singling him out
for exclusive inheritance of wealth, because inheritance of
wealth is something ordinary and common among people.
(Who shall inherit me and inherit [also] the posterity of Ya'qoob
[Jacob].) (Qur'an 19: 5-6)
What is meant is not inheritance of wealth, because he
(Zakan'ya) did not inherit any of the wealth of the family of

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

231

Ya'qoob; rather those who would inherit from the posterity of
Ya'qoob are their children and other heirs, if they did inherit.69
Similarly, the words of Allah: #And verily, I fear my relatives
after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an
heir,# (Qur'an 19: 5) do not indicate that the inheritance in this
case was inheritance of wealth, because Zakariya was not afraid
that they would take his wealth after he died. That is not what he
was worried about, because Zakariya (,g%)
was not known to
have any wealth, he was a carpenter who ate from what his own
hands earned, as it says in Saheeh ~ u s l i r n . 'He
~ did not have any
more savings than what he needed to keep him going; therefore,
his asking Allah (@) for a son to inherit from him indicates that
what is meant in these two verses is inheritance of prophethood
and taking over his position.71
A l - Q w b i said in his commentaq on this verse: "Based on that,
he did not ask for someone to inherit his wealth, because the
Prophets are not inherited from. This is the more correct of the
two opinions concerning the interpretation of this verse. What
Zakariya (m)meant was inheritance of knowledge and
prophethood, not inheritance of wealth, because it is proven that
said: 'We prophets are not inherited from; what
the Prophet (g)
we leave behind is
In light of this hadith, we can
understand the verse in which Allah
says, *And Sulaymh
[Solomon] inherited [the howledge ofl Diiwood [David].)
(Qur'an 27: 16) This is similar to what Zakariya (,@) said: (Who
shall inherit me, and inherit [also] the posterity of Ya'qoob
[Jacob] [inheritance of the religious knowledge and
prophethood, not of wealth]. And m&e
my Lord, one
with whom You are Well-Pleased!'b (Qur'an 19: 6)

(s)

The second verse explains what is meant in the first verse.
Sulaymih did not inherit the wealth that Diiwood left behind;

232

'Ali ibn Abi TCilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

rather what he inherited from him was wisdom and knowledge.
Similarly, Y&ya inherited from the posterity of Ya'qoob
This is what the scholars said about the interpretation of the
Qur'an, except for the ~ Z f i d i s . ~ ~

(m).

It is worth pointing out that the R2fifidiswent against their own
interpretation that inheritance is something obligatory when they
limited the legacy of the Prophet (g)
to Fitimah (@a) only, and
claimed that no one inherited from the Prophet (@j)except her.
Thus they excluded his wives and his relatives, contrary to the
general meaning of the verses that they quoted as evidence. AsSadooq narrated with his chain of narration from Abu Ja'far alBiiqir that he said: "No, by Allah, neither al-'Abbh, nor 'Ali,
nor any of his heirs except Fiitimah (I$+,) inherited from the
Messenger of Allah (B).The only reas& why 'Ali (&) took
the Prophet's weapon and other things was to pay off his
debts."74 Al-Kulayui, as-Sadooq and at-Toosi narrated, with
their chains of narration going hack to al-Biiqir, that he said: "Ali
inherited his knowledge from the Messenger of Allah (g),
and
F2timah
inherited his estate."75In fact, they even excluded
Fiitimah
from that when they claimed that women do not
inherit property. In his book al-KLij'i, Al-Kulayni included a
chapter entitled: "Women do not inherit anything of property,"
in which he quoted a number of reports, including a report from
Abu Ja'far a.-Saiq in which he said: "Women do not inherit
anything of land or property."76

(a)
(6)

As-Sadooq narrated, with his chain of narration going back to
Maysar, who said: "I asked him (a$-Siidiq) about women and
what they are entitled to of inheritance. He said: 'As for land and
property, they do not inherit them."'77 Thus it becomes clear
that from their point of view, F2timah (I$&) was not entitled to
anything of the inheritance - without even having to quote as

'Ali ibn Abi Tklib

233

evidence the hadith, "We prophets are not inherited from."78 If
women do not inherit property or land, on what grounds could
Ficimah (@&)have asked for Fadak - according to what they
say -which is undoubtedly property?79This indicates that they
are lying and contradicting themselves, let alone the fact of their
ignorance.80

(a)

They also claim that Abu Bala (&) asked Fitimah
to
bring witnesses, and she brought 'Ali and Umm Ayman (may
Allah be pleased with them), but that Abu Bakr (&) refused to
accept their testimony. This is an obvious and blatant lie.
Hamm2d ibn Ishiq said: "As for what some people narrated
about Fitimah (I&+) asking for Fadak and saying that the
Messenger of Allah (@) had allocated it to her, and 'Ali (&)
testifying to that hut Abu Bakr (&) not accepting his testimony
because he was her husband, this is something that has no basis,
and no report could ever be proven concerning that; rather it is
fabricated and bas no proof."81
4.

The Sunnah and scholarly consensus indicate that the Prophet
(B)was not to be inherited from. Ibn Taymiyah said: "The fact
that the Prophet (g)
was not to be inherited from is definitively
proven in the sound Sunnah and by the consensus of the
Companions, either of which is definitive proof which cannot be
contradicted by another report which appears to be general in
meaning. If it is general in meaning, then the other report is an
exception, because if we accept it as proof, it would be no more
than speculation or probability which cannot contradict that
which is definitive, because that which is speculative cannot
contradict that which is definitive. This report was narrated by
more than one of the Companions at different times and in
different gatherings, and none of the Companions ever objected
to it or denied it. Rather they all accepted it and believed it.

234

Xli ibn Abi TZlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Hence none of his wives insisted on demanding inheritance, and
his paternal uncle did not insist on demanding inheritance.
Rather when he asked for that and was told of what the Prophet
had said, he gave up his demand, and this is how matters
remained at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, including
'Ali (&).
,.
Nothing was changed, and none of the Prophet's
estate was divided."82

Ibn Taymiyah said: "Ali (&) was appointed caliph after DhunNoorayn 'Uthmk (&), and Fadak and other property came
under his control, and he did not give any part of them to any of
the children of Fitimah (I$&) or to any of the wives of the
Prophet 1%) or to any of thesons of al-'Abbis. If there was any
injustice and he was able to remove it, that would have been
easier for him than fighting Mu'iwiyah and his armies. Do you
think he would have fought Mu'iwiyah, with all the bad
consequences that resulted from that, and not given these people
a little wealth, which was much easier for him to .do?"83
There was a consensus among the Rightly Guided Caliphs
concerning this issue, and the Abbasid caliph Abn al-'Abbh asSaff* used this consensus as evidence against some of those
who debated with him concerning this issue. Ibn al-Jawzi said in
Talbees Iblees: "We narrated Erom as-Saffiiii that he addressed
the people one day, and a man who was one of the descendants
of 'Ali (&) stood up and said: '0 Amir al-Mu'rnineen, help me
against those who have wronged me.' He said: 'Who has
wronged yon? He said: 'I am one of the descendants of 'Ali
(&), and the one who wronged me was Abn Bakr (&) when
he took Fadak from Fswah.' As-Saf* said: 'Did he persist in
wronging you? The man said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Who succeeded
him?' The man said: ' 'Umar.' He said: 'Did he persist in
wronging you?' The man said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Who succeeded

235

him?' The man said: "Uthmiin.' The man said: 'Did he persist in
wronging you?' He said: 'Yes.' As-S&ah said: 'Who succeeded
him?' And the man began turning around as if he was looking
for an escape
Some of the descendants of 'Ali (&)
. . from Fiitimah (I&) stated
clearly that Ahu Bakr (&) was correct in his judgement on the
issue of Fadak, according to what was narrated by al-Bayhaqi
with his chain of narration from Fudayl ibn Marzooq, who said:
"Zayd ibn 'Ali ihn d-Husayn ibn 'Ali ibn Ahi Taih said: 'If I
were in Ahu Bakr's position, I would have given the same ruling
as Abu Bakr did with regard to ~ a d a k . " " ~Ahu d-'Abbiis d Q w b i (may AUah have mercy on him) also narrated that there
was consensus among Ahl al-Bayt, starting with 'Ali (&) and
his sons after him, then the sons of al-'Abbh, in whose hands
was left the charity of the Messenger of Allah (B).
They did not
think that they had the right to possess it; rather they spent it for
the sake of AUah (&). Al-Quwhi said: "When 'Ali (&)
became caliph, he did not change its status from the way it had
been at the time of Ahu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmk (may Allah be
pleased with them). He never tried to take possession of it or to
take a share of it; rather he managed it in the way it had been
managed before. Then it came under the control of Hasan ibn
'Ali, then Husayn ihn 'Ali,
then 'Ali ihu al-Husayn, then alHusayn ihn al-Hasan, then Zayd ibn al-Hnsayn, then Ahdnllah
ihn d-Husayn, then the Abbasids got control of it, according to
what was stated by Abu Bakr al-Burqini in his Saheeh." They
are senior figures of Ah1 alBayt (may Allah he pleased with
them) and are held in high esteem by the Shia and their scholars.
It is not narrated from any of them that they took possession of it
or inherited it or passed it on as an inheritance. If what the Shia
say is trne, then 'Ali (&) or another member of Ah1 al-Bayt
would have kept it when they got control of it.86

236

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Ibn Katheer said: 'The R%&s spoke about this issue on the
basis of ignorance and spoke of something of which they had no
knowledge. They rejected something without having real
knowledge of it, and they tried to get involved in something that
did not concern
If they had understood the matter as it
really was, they would have recognised the virtue of Abu Bakr
(&) and accepted his explanation, which everyone should
accept. But they are a domed group, cheap and vile, who adhere
to ambiguous matters and ignore issues that are well-established
with the leaders of Islam, namely the Companions, Tsbi'oon and
scholars who are respected in all places and in all eras, may
Allah (&) be pleased with them all and make them pleased."88
5.

Fstimah's goodwill towards Abu Bakr (A).It is proven that
Fstimah (@) was pleased with Abu B ~ (&)
G after that, and
she died pleased with him, according to what was narrated by alBayhaqi with his chain of narration from ash-Shu'bi, who said:
"When Fitimah fell sick, Abu Bakr a.-Sideeq (&) came and
asked for permission to see her. 'Ali (&) said: '0 Fstimah, here
is Abu Bakr, asking permission to see yon.' She said: 'Do you
want me to give him permission?' He said: 'Yes.' So she gave
him permission to enter upon her to try to reconcile with her. He
said: 'By Allah, I never forsook my property, my wealth, my
family and my tribe except to seek the pleasure of Allah and His
Messenger and the pleasure of Ahl d-Bayt.' And he kept saying
kind words to her until she was pleased with him."89 Ibn
Katheer said: "This is a good and strong chain of narration, and it
seems that 'h
ash-Shu'bi heard it from 'Ali (&), or he was
one of those who heard it from 'Ali (4&)."90
.

Thus the R%@i criticism of Abu Bakr (&), which they base
on Fshmah's being angry with him, is refuted. If she was upset with
Abu Bakr (&) in the beginning, she was pleased with him after that,

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

237

and when she died, she was pleased with him. The one who sincerely
loves her cannot afford but to be pleased with whomever she is
pleased with?' This cannot be contradicted by what is proven in the
hadith of 'A'ishah (I$&): "The family of Muhammad (B)could only
live on this wealth, A d by Allah I will not change anything of the
charity of the Messenger of Allah
from the way it was at the time
of the Messenger of Allah (g);
I shall manage it as the Messenger of
Allah (&) managed it." According to 'A'ishah (I&), Abu Bakr (&)
refused to give Fiitimah (I&) something from it;and Fiitimah (@>)
got upset with Abu Bakr (&)because of that, so she forsook him
and never spoke to him until she died.92 This was as much as
'kishah (I$&) knew, but in the hadith of ash-Shu'bi there is
additional &formation that proves that. Abu Bakr (4)visited
Fitimah (&) and that she spoke to him and was pleased with him.
'kishah (I&) denied it and ash-Shu'bi affirmed it, and it is well
known to the scholars that the words of one who aflinns take
precedence over the words of one who denies, because it is possible
that something happened without the knowledge of the one who
denied it, especially with regard to such issues. Abu Bakr's visit to
Fstimah (I$&) when she was sick was not a major issue that everyone
would have known about; rather it was an ordinary matter that was
not known to those who did not witness it, and no one would care to
transmit it, because there was no need to mention it.

(s)

The scholars stated that Fgtimah (&) did not deliberately shun
Abu Bakr (&)
in the first place; a woman like her is far above doing
,.
such a thing because the Prophet (g)
forbade shunning for more than
three days. Rather, she did not speak to him because there was no
need to do so.93 Al-Qwubi, the author of al-Mufhim, said in the
context of commenting on the hadith of 'kishah
referred to
above: "Moreover, she [meaning Fiitimah (%)I did not meet Abu
Bakr (&) because of her grief at the loss of the Messenger of Allah
(g)
and because she stayed in her house, and the narrator described

(a)

238

'Ali ibn Abi Ta^libat the time ofthe Rightly Guided Caliphs

(a)

that as forsaking or shunning. But the Messenger of Allah
said:
'It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more
than three days."'94 She was the most howledgeable of people
about what was permissible and forbidden in that regard, and she was
the least likely of people to go against the command of the Messenger
of Allah (g).
., How could she he like that when she was a part of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
and the leader of the women of paradise?95
An-Nawawi said: "With regard to what is mentioned about
Fstimah (&)shunning Abn Ba!u (&), what it means is that she
kept to herself and did not meet him, and this is not the shunning that
is h a r k , which involves not greeting the person and turning away
when meeting him. The words in this hadith, 'she did not speak to
him', mean that she did not speak to him about this matter, or that she
kept to herself and did not ask him for any need, and she had no need
to meet him or talk to him. There is no narration at all to suggest that
they met and she did not greet or speak to him."96 Ficmah (I$&) was
distracted from everything by her grief at the loss of the noiilest of
creation, which was a calamity in comparison to which all other
calamities look small. She was also preoccupied with her illness,
which kept her bedridden and unable to participate in anything, let
alone meeting the caliph of the Muslims, who was busy every minute
of the day with the affairs of the Ummah, the wars of apostasy and
other matters. She also knew that she would soon join her father, as
the Messenger of Allah (g)
had told her that she would be the first
one of his family to join him.97 The one who has this type of
knowledge does not wony about any worldly affairs. How good are
the words of al-Muhallab which were narrated by al-'Ayni: "No
narrator said that they met and refused to greet one another; rather she
stayed in her house, and the narrator described that as shunning."98
One of the things that indicate that the relationship between
. ., and Fgtimah (&)
was very strong is that the wife of
Abu Ba!u (&)
.,

'Ali ibn Abi T&lib

239

Abu Bakr (&), Asma' bint 'Umays, is the one who tended to
Fstimah (%); the daughter of the Prophet ( g ) , during her final
illness, andshe was with her until she took her last breath. She was
one of those who washed her and prepared her for burial. 'Ali (&)
tended her himself and was helped in that by Asma'. Fgtimah (I&,)
gave Asma' some instructions with regard to how she was to b e
shrouded and buried, and how her funeral was to be, and Asma'
carried out those instruction^.^^ Fstimah (F&) said to Asma': "I do
not like what is done to women: they cover the woman with a cloth
that shows her shape." Asma' said: "0daughter of the Messenger of
Allah (g),
shall I tell you of something that I saw in Abyssinia?" She
called for some fresh palm leaves, then she bent them and covered
them with a cloth. Fitimah (%)said: "How good and beautiful this
is! With this a woman can be told apart from a man."loO It was
narrated from Ibn 'Abdul-Barr that Fitimah
was the &st one in
Islam whose bier way covered in this manner, and Zaynab bint J&sh
was the next one.

(a)

Abu Bakr (&) was in constant contact with 'Ali (&) to ask
about the condition of the daughter of the Prophet (g),
contrm to
was sick, and 'Ali (&) was
what the people claim. Fitimah
praying the five daily prayers in the mosque. After he had prayed,
Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) would ask
him: "How is the daughter of the Messenger of AUah (g)?"
At the
same time, he was in contact with her through his wife Asma', as she
was the one who was actually in charge of taking care of her.
On the day Fsernah (I&) died, Madinah was shaken with the
weeping of men and women-'alike, and the people were distraught
just as they had been on the day the Messenger of Allah (@Jdied.
Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) went~tooffer
condolences to 'Ali (&) and said: "0Abu al-Hasan, do not offer the
funeral prayer for the daughter of the Messenger of AUah before you

240

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

tell us."'O1 She died the night before Tuesday, on the third of
Ramadan 11 AH. Ibn Milik ihn Ja'far ihn Muhammad nmated from
his father that his grandfather 'Ali ibn al-Husayn said: "Fiitimah died
between sunset and nightfall, and Ahu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmin, azZubayr and 'Abdur-Rahmin ibn 'Awf (may Allah be pleased with
them) were present. When she was placed for the funeral prayer to he
offered over her, 'Ali (&) said: 'Go forward, 0 Abu Bakr (to lead
the prayer).' Abu Bakr (4)
said: 'What about you, 0 Ahu al-Hasan?'
'Ali (&) said: 'By Allah, no one hut you will lead the prayer over
her.' So Ahu Bakr (&) led the funeral prayer for her, and she was
buried at night." It says in another report that Abu Bakr (&) offered
the funeral prayer for Fitimah (%),the daughter of the Messenger of
Allah (g),
and said takbeer over her four times.lo2 According to a
report narrated by Muslim, 'Ali ibn Abi TSih (&) offered the funeral
prayer for her, and this is more likely to he correct.lo3
M&ammad IqhS spoke eloquently in his ode to Fitimah azZahra', in which he said:

The lineage of the Messiah gives an honourable name to Maryam,
whose memory will live for ever,
But glory comes from three sources in the case of F e W h ,
and how great they are.
She is the daughter of whom? The wife of whom?
The mother of whom? Who can come close to the
honourable status of her father?
She is aflash of lightfrom the eye of al-Mugafa, the one who guided
peoples who were lost.
He (the Prophet) is the one who awoke the sleeping
with his guidance, as if he brought them
back to life after they were dead.
He restored the course of history, just like a bride
in her adornment and beauty.

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

241

She is an example for mothers and an ideal;
the shining moon follows in her footsteps.
She resorted to beautzfil patience as a means of
nourishment and steadfastness; she believed
that what pleased her husband pleased her...
Were it not for my adherence to the guidance of
al-Mugafa and the limits set by Sharia,
may our souls be sacrificed for her,
I would have circumambulated her grave
and I would have kissed every spot of the
good dust that covers her resting place.104

1.6. Ties of marriage between Abu Bakr
and Ah1 al-Bayt, and Ahl al-Bayt giving
the name Abu Bakr to some of their sons
The ties between Abu Bakr as-Sideeq (&), the successor of
the Messenger of AUah (g),
and the members of the Prophet's
family (Ah1 al-Bayt) were friendly and respectful, as befits him and
them. This love and tmst were mutual and were so strong that it
cannot be imagined that there would be any problems or disputes,
regardless of the myths and tales fabricated by the storytellers. AsSideeqah 'kishah, daughter of as-Sideeq Abu Bakr, was the wife of
the Prophet (g)
and one of the dearest of people to him, no matter
how much the enviers resent this fact and no matter how many
gmdges those who bold different views may have in their hearts. This
is a proven fact, and she is pure and innocent on the basis of the
testimony of the Qur'an, even if the fabricators rejected and denied
that.
Moreover, Asma' hint 'Umays had been the wife of Ja'far ibn
Abi Tilib, the brother of 'Ali (&); after Ja'far died, she manied Abu
Bakr (&) and bore him a son whom he called Muhammad, who was

242

Xli ibn Abi Ttlib at the time o f the Rightly Guided Caliphs

later appointed by 'Ali (&) as the governor of Egypt. When Ahu
Bakr (&) died, 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&) married her, and she bore
him a son whom he called
The granddaughter of Ahu Bakr
(&) was married to Muhammad al-Biqir, a grandson of 'Ali (&)
who is considered the hfth Imam by the Rifidis.
Professor @ s h I B i maheer quoted from the books of the
Rifidis themselves proof of the strong connections and ties through
marriage that existed between the family of the Prophet (g)
and the
family of Abu Bakr (&). It is proven that Qhimibn M&ammad ibn
Abi Bakr, the grandson of Ahu Bakr (&), and 'Ali ibn al-Husayn
ibn 'Ali ibn Abi T S b , the grandson of 'Ali (&), were maternal
cousins. Their mothers were among the female prisoners captured at
the time of 'Umar (&);
, ,
they were the daughters of Yazdagird ibn
Shahriyk and the granddaughters of Chosroes. Professor a a h e e r
discussed the issue in detail in order to prove ties through marriage
and a relationship of mutual love and compassion between Ahl alBayt and the family of Abu Bakr (&).Io6
One of the signs of the love and friendship that existed
between Ah1 al-Bayt and Ahu Bakr (4)
was the fact that many of
them gave Abu Bala's name to their sons. The first was 'Ali ihn Abi
T%h (&), when he called one of his sons Abu Bakr. This is
indicative of love, brotherhood and respect for Abu Bakr on the part
of 'Ali (may AUah be pleased with them both). It is worth mentioning
that this child was born after Abu Bakr (&) had died, so it was
obviously after he had become the caliph and leader. Is there anyone
among the Shia today who claims to love 'Ali (4)
and his sons and
carries this name? Are they supporters of 'Ali (&) or his opponents?
'Ali (&) only gave his son this name because he hoped that the child
would he like Abu Bakr (A).It was an expression of love and
loyalty towards him, even after his death; there was no one among
Banu Hiishim before 'Ali (&) who gave his son this name.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

243

Moreover, 'Ali(&) was not the only one who sought blessings and
showed love and sincerity towards Ahu Bakr (&). His sons
followed in his footsteps; both al3asan and al-wusayn had sons
named Abu Bakr. This was mentioned by al-Ya'qoohi and alMas'oodi, who are both Rifidi historian^.'^^ Ah1 al-Bayt continued
to name their sons Abu Bakr, for example, the nephew of 'Ali ibn
Ahi Tdih (&), Abdullah ibn Ja'far at-Tayyir ibn Abi T%b, called
one of his sins Abu Bakr. This is one of the signs of love and
friendship among people and is contray to the claims of the R Z d i s
today that there was enmity, hatred and persistent arguments and
differences among them.'''

1.7. 'Ali (&) and the death of
Abu Bakr as-Sideeq
'Ali (4)
was one of those whom Abu Ba!u (&) consulted as
to who should become caliph after he was gone. Ali's view was that
'Umar (&) should become caliph after Ahu Bakr (&).'09
When it was time to depart this world, and death came to Abu
Bakr (&), the last words he spoke were the words of Allah (&):
dCause me to die as a Muslim [the one submitting to Your Will], and
join me with the righteous) (Qur'an12: 101). Madinah was shaken by
the death of Ahu Bakr as-Sideeq (&) on that sorrowful evening; not
since the death of the Prophet
had this city seen so many men
and women crying. 'Ali (&) came rushing in, weeping and saying,
"InnaLillZhi wa i n m ilayhi rci;iii'oon(Verily to Allah we belong, and
to Him is our return)." He stood at the door of the room in which Ahu
Bakr (&) lay and said:

(s)

"May Allah have mercy on you, 0 Abu Bakr. You were a close
friend of the Messenger of AUah (g),
one with whom he felt at ease,
in whom he confided and whom he consulted. You were the first of
people to become Muslim and the most sincere in faith, the most

244

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

pious, the most fearing of Allah, the most effective in supporting the
religion of AUah, the most protective towards the Messenger of Allah
(B),the most caring about Islam, the closest in companionship, the
greatest in virtue, the best among those who strive to do righteous
deeds, the highest in status, the one who has closest access to his
Lord, the most closely resembling the Messenger of Allah (@ in
adherence to Islam and attitude, the noblest in position, the one held
in the highest esteem by the Prophet (g)
and the dearest to him. May
Allah
give yon the best reward on behalf of the Messenger of
AUah (&)
~,
and on behalf of Islam. You believed the Messenger of
Allah (g)
when the people disbelieved him. You were as dear to him
as his hearing and sight. AUah ( B )called you af-Sideeq in His
revelation, as He said: $ ~ n he
d [Muhammad], who has brought the
truth [this Qur'an and Islamic Monotheism] and [thosewho] believed
therein [faddaqabihi] [i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism],
those are al-Muttaqoon [the pious]) (Qur'an 39: 33). You consoled
him and supported him when others refrained, you stood with him at
times of hardship when others held hack; you gave him the best
companionship at the time of difficulty. You were the second of two,
his companion in the cave, the one to whom Allah (&) sent down
His sakeenah (calmness, tranquillity, peace)110, his companion
during the migration to Madinah, his successor in leading the religion
and Ummah of Allah, the best successor in dealing with the
apostates. You have done what no successor of any Prophet ever did;
you took initiatives when other companions hesitated; you strove
when they kept quiet; you showed strength when they showed
weakness; yon adhered to the way of the Messenger of Allah (g)
when they faltered. You were, as the Messenger of AUah (@) said,
weak in physical being, strong in supporting the religion of Allah,
humble in yourseLf and great in the sight of Allah (&),held in high
esteem in people's eyes and highly thought of. None of them ever
had any criticism against you, and no one could ever find anything

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

245

bad to say against you, and you never looked down on any person.
The weak, in your view, were strong and powetful until you restored
their rights; close relatives and strangers were all equal before you;
the one who is more obedient or more pious is the closest of people to
you. You were the man of truth, sincerity and kindness; when you
said something, you meant what you said. You were a man of
patience and resolve; your opinion spoke of knowledge and clarity;
the religion was supported by you; faith was strengthened by means
of you, and Islam prevailed. You went far ahead of everyone, and
you are going to make your successors work hard (to emulate you):
you attained a clear victory. Verily to Allah we belong, and to Him is
our return; we accept the will of Allah and submit to His decree. By
AUah, besides the Messenger of Allah (g),
the Muslims will never
he affected by the loss of a man as they will be by losing you. You
brought support, protection and refuge to Islam. May Allah (@)
cause you to join your Prophet Mdpmmad (g)
and not deprive us of
reward for your loss or misguide us after you are gone."
The people fell silent until he had finished speaking, then they
wept, and their voices grew loud as they said: "You have spoken the
truth.""'
According to another report, when 'Ali (4)
entered upon
Abu Bakr (&) after he had been laid out, he said: "There is no one
with whose record of deeds I would love to meet Allah (g)
more
than this man who has been laid out.""'

2. A

( ) at the time of
'Umar al-Farooq

'Mi (&) was a prominent member of the consultative
committee of 'Umar's state; indeed, he was the main consultant.
'Umar (&) acknowledged 'Ali's virtue, understanding of Islam and

246

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

wisdom, and he had a good opinion of hi.It is proven that he said
concerning him: "The best of us in judiciary matters is 'Ali (&)."l13
Ibn al-Jawzi said: "Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with
them) nsed to consult him, and 'Umar nsed to say: 'I seek refuge with
Allah from a problem that Abu al-Hasan ('Ali) cannot handle."'114
Masrooq said: "The people nsed to learn from six: 'Umar, 'Ali,
Abdullah, Abu Moosa, Zayd ibn Th2bit and Ubayy ibn Ka'b." And
he said: "I got to know the companions of Muhammad (&), and I
realised that the most prominent of them in knowledge were six:
'Umar, 'Ali, Abdullah, Abu ad-Dardi?, Ubayy ibn Ka'b and Zayd ibn
Th2bit. Then I got to know the six, and I realised that the most
prominent in knowledge among them were two: 'Ali and
~bdnllah.""~He also said: "The most prominent in knowledge are
three: a scholar in Madinah, a scholar in Syria and a scholar in Iraq.
The scholar in Madinah was 'Ali ibn Ahi T%b, the scholar in Kufa (in
Iraq) was Abdullah ibn Mas'ood, and the scholar in Syria was Abu adDardi?." When they met, the scholar of Syria and the scholar of Iraq
would ask the scholar of Madinah, and he would not ask them.ll6
'Ali (&) was one of those who were close to 'Umar and
supported him. He did not withhold any suggestion or advice from
him, and he strove with him to come up with solutions to problems
concerning which there was no text, and to organise the affairs of the
emerging state. There is a great deal of evidence to that effect, of
which we will mention the following:

2.1. With regard to judicial matters
2.1.1. A woman who experienced a fit of madness
It was narrated from Abu mabyin alJanbi that a woman who
had committed adultery was brought to 'Umar ihn al-KhatGb (&),

Xli a n Abi Trilib

247

and he ordered that she be stoned. They took her to stone her, but
they were met by 'Ali, who said: "What is this?" They said: "She
committed adultery, and 'Umar ordered that she be stoned." 'Ali
took her away from them and sent them back, so they went back to
'Umar, who said: "Why have yon come hack?" They said: "Ali sent
us back." He said: "Ali has only done this because of something that
he knows." So he sent for 'Ali (&), who came, looking upset.
'Umar (&) said: "Why did you send them back?" 'Ali (&) said:
"Did you not hear the Prophet (g)
say: 'The pen is lifted from three:
from the sleeper until he wakes up, from the child until he grows up
and from the insane until he recovers'?" He said: "Yes." 'Ali (&)
said: "This is the afflicted woman of Banu so-and-so; perhaps he (the
adulterer) came to her while she was going through one of her fits of
madness." 'Umar (&) said: "I did not know," and he did not stone
her.'I7 'Umar (&)
.. did not know that she was insane.

2.1.2. Doubling the had$ punishment
for the one who drank alcohol
'Umar adopted the view of 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with
them both) with regard to doubling the hadd punishment for the one
who drank alcohol. The drinking of alcohol had become widespread,
especially in the recently conquered countries that were newly
Muslim, so 'Ali suggested to 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them
both) that eighty lashes should be given as the lightest punishment.
He explained: "We see that when a person gets chunk, he speaks
nonsense, and if he speaks nonsense, he fabricates, and the
punishment for the fabricator is eighty lashes.""* It is proven that
'Ali (&) said: "I never cany out a hadd punishment on anyone and I
get upset if he dies, except in the case of the one who drank alcohol.
If he dies, I pay the compensation to his family, because the
Messenger of Allah (g)
did not prescribe that."119 Al-Bayhaqi
explained his words "the Messenger of Allah (&) did not prescribe

248

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

that" as referring to anything more than forty lashes, or as meaning
that he did not prescribe giving lashes with the whip; rather he
prescribed using shoes and the hems of garments, striking forty
times. And Allah (&) knows best.'''
The Islamic jurists derived
from the actions of the Rightly Guided Caliphs the number of lashes
for the hadd punishment. According to M i l k , ath-Thawri, Abu
Haneefah and those who followed them, it is eighty, because of the
consensus of the Companions. Those who said that the hadd
punishment is forty lashes were Abu Bakr and ash-Sh2fafa'i,
and it was
one of the views of Apmad. The extra number added by 'Umar (&)
is to be interpreted as a disciplinary punishment that is permissible to
cany out if the ruler sees fit. This is the correct view according to ash~h2fa'i.l'~This opinion was also favoured by lbn Taymiyah, who
said: "But if drinking is not widespread and not excessive, then forty
lashes is e n o ~ ~ h . " " ~

2.1.3. "You have no authority over
what is in her w o m b
A pregnant woman was brought to 'Umar (&). When he
questioned her, she admitted committing adultery, so 'Umar ordered
that she be stoned. She was met by 'Ali (&), who said: "What is
going on with this woman?" They said: ''Amit- al-Mu'mineen
('Umar) has ordered that she be stoned." 'Ali took her back and said:
"Did you order that she be stoned?" 'Umar (&) said: "Yes, she
admitted to me that she had committed adultery." 'Ali (&) said:
"You have authority over her, but what authority do you have over
what is in her womb?" And 'Ali (&)
. . said: "Perhaps you rebuked
her or scared her." 'Umar (&) said: "That is what happened." 'Ali
(&) said: "Did you not hear the Prophet (g)
say: 'No hadd
punishment is to be carried out on someone who admits wrongdoing
if he is subjected to harshness. If you chain or detain or threaten
someone, then his admission is not valid."' So 'Umar (&) let her

go, then he said: "Women are no longer able to bear sons like 'Ali ihn
Abi Tilib; were it not for 'Ali, 'Umar would be doomed."1z3
Ibn Taymiyah commented on this story: "If it is sound, it must
be that 'Umar (&)
did not know that she was pregnant, so 'Ali (&)
,.
told him. There is no doubt that the basic principle is that it was not
known, and if the ruler does not know that the one who deserves to be
executed or stoned is pregnant, then some of the people tell him about
her situation, that comes under the heading of informing about
people's situation." Then he said, concerning 'Umar (&I:
"He used
to restore people's rights, cany out hadd punishments and judge
among all people. During his caliphate, Islam spread and prevailed in
an unprecedented manner, and he was always judging between
people and giving fatwas; if he did not have a great deal of
knowledge, be could not have done that. If he was uncertain about
one case in a hundred thousand, then he came to know it, or had
forgotten it then was reminded of it, what is wrong with that?"lZ4 He
said this in refutation of the Rifi&s.

2.1.4. "Misjudgements are to be reviewed
in accordance with the Sunnah"
A woman who had gotten married during her 'iddah was
brought to 'Umar (&), SO he separated her from the man she
married, took her mahr and put it in the public treasury and said: "I do
not allow a mahr in a marriage that is invalidated." He also said:
"You two should never many again." News of that reached 'Ali
(4).
and he said: "If they were unaware of the ruling, she may keep
the mahr because he was intimate with her, but they should be
separated, and when her 'iddah ends, he will be like any other
suitor." 'Umar (&)
. ., addressed the people and said: "Misjudgements
are to be reviewed in accordance with the Sunnah, and 'Umar (&)
judged according to the view of 'Ali (&)."125

250

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

2.1.5. "This man had his way with me and
brought shame on me among my peoplef'
Ja'far ibn Muhammad said: "A woman was brought to 'Umar
ibn al-Khattib (&) who had fallen in love with a young man of the
An$%. When he did not respond to her, she tried a trick against him.
She took an egg, threw away the yolk and poured the white between
her thighs and on her clothes, then she ran screaming to 'Umar (&)
and said: 'This man had his way with me and brought shame on me
among my people, and here are the traces of what he did.' 'Umar
(&) asked the women, and they told him: 'There are traces of semen
on her body and clothing.' 'Umar (&) thought of punishing the
young man, but the man started asking for help and saying: '0 Amir
al-Mu'mineen, verify the issue, for by Allah I never did anything
wrong and never even thought of it. She tried to tempt me, but I
refused.' 'Umar (&) said: '0 Abn al-Hasan ('Ali), what do you
think about her case?' 'Ali (&)
, .. looked at what was on the garment.
Then he called for boiling hot water, which he poured onto the
garment, and the egg white solidified. Then he took it and smelled it
and tasted it, and he recognised the taste of egg. He rebuked the
woman and she admitted it."IZ6
From this event, we learn:
(a) That the means of proof in the Islamic judicial system
include confession, testimony, oath and denial, and they
also include circumstantial evidence and intuition.
(b) That 'Umar was keen to consult the senior Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them) with regard to new
issues, especially 'Ali, whom he held in the highest
esteem."'

2.2. 'Ali (&) and the financial and
administrative systems in 'Umar's state
2.2.1. Financial matters
2.2.1.a. The caliph's expenses
At first, after 'Umar ibn al-Khanib (&) was appointed leader
of the Muslims after Abu Bakr (&), he did not consume anything
from the public treasluy. Then he started going through hardship
because he was distracted from his business by taking care of the
people's affairs, so the small amount he earned from his trade was no
longer sufficient. He sent for the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
to consult with them, and he asked: "I am distracted by this
matter; what do yon think is sufficient for me to take?" 'Uthmb ibn
'AfEn (&) said: "Just your food," and this was also the view of
Sa'eed ibn Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl. 'Umar said to 'ALi: "What do
you say about that?" He said: "The morning meal and the evening
meal," so 'Umar followed that. 'Umar described what he took from
the public treasury (to sustain himself) in the following terms: "My
position with regard to the wealth of Allah is like that of one who is in
charge of an orphan. If I have no need of it, I leave it alone, but if I
become poor and in need, then1take from it on a reasonable basis."128
2.2.1.b. 'Ali's opinion concerning the land of
as-Sawsd (Iraqi lowlands) in Iraq
When the land of asSawiid (the lowlands) in Iraq was
conquered by force, a number of the Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) suggested to 'Umar (&) that it should be divided
among the conquerors. Because the land was so vast and fertile, and
because of 'Umar's farsightedness, bearing in mind the coming
generations, he was not comfoable with the idea of dividing it. He
consulted 'Ali (&),
,.
and 'Ali's opinion was the same as his, that it

252

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

should not he divided. He followed his opinion and said: "Were it not
for the sake of the coming generations of Muslims, I would not have
conquered any city but I would have divided it among the conquerors
as the Prophet (g)
divided ~ h a ~ b a r . " ' ~ ~

2.2.l.c. "You should certainly share it out"
Some wealth was brought to 'Umar (&), and he divided it
among the Muslims. There was some left over, so he consulted the
Companions about it, and they suggested that he keep it for any
emergencies that might arise. 'Ali (&) was among the people, but
he kept quiet. 'Umar (&) wanted to hear 'Ali's opinion, so 'Ali
(&) reminded him of the hadith about the wealth of Bahrain, when it
was brought to the Prophet (@) and he divided it all. 'Umar said to
'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them): You should certainly share it
out. So 'Ali (&)shared it out.130 It seems that this took place before
the setting up of the government ministries.131

2.2.2. 'Ali (4)
and administrative matters
When 'Umar (&) needed to establish a fixed calendar in
order to organise the affairs of state, he gathered the people together
and asked them from which date the calendar should begin. 'Ali (&)
said: "From the day the Messenger of Allah (@J migrated and left the
land ofpolytheism," so 'Umar
did that.132'Umar (&) thought
of 'Ali (&,) as one of the best ofthose who could lead the people. It
was narrated from him that he was talking with a man among the
An& and he said: 'Who do you think will succeed me?" The An$%
listed the names of some of the Muhiijireen, but he did not mention
'Ali.'Umar said: "What do you think of 'Ali? For by Allah, if you
appointed him, he would lead you on the path of truth even if yon
were reluctant."133After 'Umar (&) was stabbed, he said to his son
Abdullah ibn 'Urnar (&): "If th& appoint the bald one ('Ali), he
will lead them on the straight path."134

2.2.3. 'Umar often appointed 'Ali
in charge of Madinah in his absence
(a) 'Umar (&) put 'Ali (&) in charge when he went out to the
water of Sma' and camped there. That was just before
Qsdisiyyah, when the Persians had mobilised to fight the
Muslims. 'Umar (&) gathered the people and consulted them,
and they all said that he should go out to fight.'35
(b) He left him in charge when he went out and camped at alJsbiyyah. That was when 'Amr ibn al-'AS (&) camped at
Ajnadeen, and Artaboon of Byzantium wrote to him, saying:
"By God, you will never he able to conquer any part of Palestine
after Ajnadeen; go hack and do not deceive yourself. The one
who will conquer it is a man whose name has three letters."
'Amr realised that this was 'Umar (&) [whose name in Arabic
has three letters], so he wrote to him to tell him that the conquest
was being kept for him. 'Umar (&) called the people to go out
and fight, and he selected 'Ali ibn Ahi Taih (&)to he in charge
of Madinah while he was gone.136

(c) 'Umar (&) appointed 'Ali (&) to be in charge of Madinah
when he took the wives of the Prophet (@J for hajj. This was in
23 AH, and it was the last hajj he led. The Mothers of the
Believers had their next of kin with them, in front of whom they
did not have to veil themse~ves.'~'

2.3. 'Umar (&) consulted 'Ali (&)
with regard to jihad and matters of state
One of the most prominent things that may be noted by anyone
who studies 'Umar's caliphate is the special relationship and sincere
cooperation that existed between 'Umar and 'Ali (may Allah he
pleased with them both). 'Ali (&) was one of the main consultants

254

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

for 'Umar ibn al-Khat$ib (&); 'Umar used to seek advice from him
concerning both major and minor matters. 'Ali (&) gave him
sincere advice concerning all his affairs,13' and 'Ali never made a
suggestion to 'Umar, but the latter implemented it out of conviction.
He consulted with him when the Muslims conquered Jerusalem,
when al-MadPin was conquered, when 'Umar wanted to head
towards Nahawand to fight the Persians, when he wanted to go out to
fight the Byzantines, when he wanled to establish the Islamic
calendar and at many other times.'39 'Ali (&) was a sincere adviser
throughout 'Umar's life; he loved him and feared for him, and 'Umar
loved 'Ali. There was mutual trust and friendship between them.
Despite all that, the enemies of Islam insist on falsifying history and
narrating false reports that suit their ideas and inclinations, so that
they may depict the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs as if everyone
was lying in wait for another in order to destroy him, as if they were
all plotting behind the scenes.140
For example, when the Persians gathered in large numbers in
Nahawand with the aim of attacking the Muslims, 'Umar (4)
gathered the people and consulted them as to whether he should
march out to fight them himself. Most of the people suggested that he
should do that, but then 'Ali (&) stood up and said: "0 Amir alMn'mineen, if you send the troops of Syria away from their country,
the Byzantines will attack their families; if you send the troops of
Yemen away from their families, the Abyssinians will attack their
families; if you leave this land (Madinah), the Arabs from all over
will rebel against you, then what you leave behind you will become
more urgent than what lies ahead on the borders. Leave these people
in their lands and write to the people of Basra. Let them form three
groups: one group to protect their women and children; another
group to keep an eye on those who have a covenant with them, so that
they will not break the treaty and rebel; and let another group go to
Kufah as reinforcements for their brothers there. If the Persians see

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

255

you going out tomorrow, they will say, 'This is the leader of the
Arabs', and that will make them more vicious in their fight against
you. As for what you mentioned about the Persians mobilising, Allah
(&)hates their mobilisation more than you do, and He is more able
to change what He dislikes. As for their numbers, we never fought in
the past on the basis of superior numbers; rather we fought with the
help of Allah." 'Umar (&) said: 'This is what I thought, and I
wanted someone to support me in that."14'
'Ali's advice was that of one who loved 'Umar (&)
and was
, ,
sincere towards him. He was very keen that he should not go out and
leave Madinah and that he should direct the affairs of war by means
of the other Arabs, while staying where he was. He warned him that if
he left, there would emerge behind him vulnerabilities that would be
more dangerous than the enemy he was going to confront. If the
Messenger of Allah
had left instructions that 'Ali (L&) should
succeed him after he was gone, would 'Ali (&)
have ignored those
,.
instructions and then supported - in such a co-operative,
constructive and sincere manner - those who had usurped his right,
nay his duty, to become caliph? Indeed, would all the Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them) have ignored the instructions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)?
Can it he imagined that they would all
unanimously agree to do that, with 'Ali (&) hrst and foremost
among them? Hence we may easily conclude that the Muslims, up
until that point at the end of 'Umar's era, and even until the end of
'Ali's era, were of one group, and that there was no problem or
confusion in the mind of any Muslim with regard to the caliphate or
with regard to who was most deserving of it.14'

a)

The frequency with which 'Umar consulted 'Ali (may Allah
be pleased with them both) and other Companions does not mean that
he had less understanding and knowledge than them. The sound
hadiths highlight the great extent of his knowledge and his perfect
commitment to religion. He asked for advice because of his faith and

256

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

love of consultation, and his desire to encourage the rulers after him
to consult advisers and not act like dictators, forcing their opinions on
others. In many cases, 'Ali (4)
retracted his opinion and followed
that of 'Umar
It was narrated from 'kishah (@) that she
said about 'Umar (&): "Ali (&) used to follow the opinion of
'Umar ibn d - K h a g b with regard to what 'Umar thought was right,
even though 'Umar frequently consulted 'Ali, to such an extent that
'Mi ( ) said: "Umar consulted me about such and such; my
opinion was such and such, and his opinion was such and such, but
ultimately I decided to follow 'Umar's view."""

2.4. 'Ali (&) and his children,
and their relationship with 'Umar
(may Allah be pleased with them all)
'Umar (&) had such great respect for the family of the
Messenger of AUah
that be preferred them to his own sons and
family. We will mention a few examples:

a)

2.4.1. "You are more deserving of permission
to enter than Abdullah ibn 'Umar"
Among the things narrated by al-Husayn ibn 'Ali (&) was:
"Umar said to me one day: '0 my son, why don't you visit us and
spend time with us? So I came one day and found him on his own
with Mu'iwiyah, Ibn 'Umar was at the door and had not been given
permission to enter, so I went back. He met me after that and said: '0
my son, why did I not see you coming to visit us?' I said: 'I came, but
you were on your own with Mu'iwiyah, and I saw that Ibn 'Umar
was not given permission to enter, so I went back.' He said: 'You are
more deserving of permission to enter than Abdullah ibn 'Umat. All
the blessings that we are enjoying, as you see, are because of Allah
(g),
then you [the Prophet
and Ah1 d - ~ a ~ t ] . ' " ' ~ ~

a)

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

257

2.4.2. "1 am very upset that I did not clothe you"
Ibn Sa'd narrated from Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Bgqir that his
father 'Ali ihn al-Husayn said: "Some suits were brought to 'Umar
(&) from Yemen, and he gave them to the people to wear, so they
began walking about wearing the suits. He was sitting between the
grave (of the Prophet) and the minbar, and the people were coming
and greeting him and praying for him. Al-Hasan and al-Husayn came
out of the house of their mother, Fiitimah (I&,),
walking through the
.rows of people, not wearing any of those suits. 'Umar (&) started to
frown, then be said: 'By Allah, I am very upset that I did not clothe
you.' They said: '0 Amir al-Mn'mineen, you clothed your people
and you did well.' He said: 'I am upset because of these two young
men who are going among the people, not wearing any of these new
clothes.' The suits were too big for them, and they were too small for
the suits. Then he wrote to the governor of Yemen, asking him to
send two suits for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and he quickly sent the
suits, which 'Umar (&) gave to them to wear."L46

2.4.3. Giving precedence to Banu Hbhim
in allocating stipends
It was narrated from Abu Ja'far that when 'Umar (&) wanted
to give a regular stipend to the people, after Allah (&) granted hirn
victory, be assembled some of the Companions of the Prophet (@I.
~,
'Ahdur-Ralpnh ibn 'Awf (&) said: "Start with yourself." He said:
"No, by Allah, rather I will start with those who are closest to the
Messenger of Allah (g)
and those who are closest to Banu Hiishim,
the tribe of the Messenger of Allah (g)."
He allocated a stipend to
al-'Abbk, then to 'Ali, until he bad Listed five clans and reached
Banu 'Adiyy ibn Ka'b. Then he wrote: "Those of Banu Hiishim who
were present at Badr, then those of Banu Umayyah ibn 'Abd Shams
who were present at Badr, then the next closest and the next closest."

258

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

He allocated stipends to them and also to al-Hasan and al-Husayn
(may Allah be pleased with them) because of their status with the
Messenger of Allah (%).I4'

2.4.4. "I was given this garment to wear
by my brother and close friend
'Ali (&) went out wearing a cloak from Aden, and he said: "I
was given this garment to wear by my brother and close friend, Amir
al-Muvmineen'Umar." 14' A report from Abu as-Safar said: " 'Ali ibn
Abi T a b (&) was seen wearing a cloak that he used to wear often.
It was said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, you wear this cloak a great deal.'
He said: 'Yes, I was given this garment to wear by my brother and
close friend 'Umar ibn al-Khag2b (&); he was sincere to Allah, and
Allah rewarded him.' Then he wept."149

2.4.5. The allocation of Yanbu'
'Umar ibn al-Khatt2b (&) allocated Yanbu' to 'Ali, who then
bought other lands in addition to what 'Umar had given him. Then he
dug, looking for water, and while they were digging, water started
gushing like the necks of camels. The workers came to 'Ali (&)
, ..
with the good news, and be gave it in charity to the poor and needy
for the sake of Allah (&). He did that for the day when some faces
will become white and some faces will become black150, so that
Allah (&) would keep his face away from the fire and keep the fire
away from his face. He wrote in the document of endowment: "These
are the instructions of 'Ali ibn Abi T3ib (&) with regard to the
disposal of his wealth: I give Yanbu', Wadi al-Qura, al-Adhniyah
and R2'ah in charity for the sake of Allah (&), seeking the pleasure
of Allah, to spend from it in every useful way for the sake of Allah, at
times of war and peace, on relatives close and distant. It is not to be
sold or given away or inherited, whether I am alive or dead. I seek

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

259

thereby the countenance of Allah and the home of the hereafter. I
seek nothing except that Allah 1%) should accept it and inherit it, and
He is the best of inheritors. That is my decision concerning it, a deal
between me and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted."'51

2.4.6. "You should speak, 0 Abu al-Hasan"
A number of people from Quraysh, including 'Ali(A),met
with 'Umar (&),
,.
and they started to discuss the honourable things
that they bad done. 'Ali (&) remained silent, so 'Umar (&) said:
"You should speak, 0 Abu al-Hasan. Why are you silent?' 'Ali did
not want to speak, so 'Umar
said again: "You should speak, 0
Abu al-Hasan." Then 'Ali (&) said:

(4)

In every battle, our swords separate the enemy's heads
from their bodies.
Allah honoured us by causing us to support His Prophet,
and by means of us, Allah made the religion of Islam prevail.
Jibreel visits us in our houses to bring
the laws of Islam and its rulings.'5z

2.4.7. A discussion between Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Umar (&) and 'Ali (&) about dreams
'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (&) said to 'ALi ibn Abi T2ib (&):
"The most amazing thing about dreams is that a man may sleep and
see something that never crossed his mind, and then the dream
materializes. And a man may see something in a dream, and it does
not mean anything." 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said: "Shall I not tell
you about that, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen? Allah (&) says153: $It is
Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those
that die not [He takes] during their sleep. He keeps those [souls] for
which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term app0inted.a
(Qur'an 39: 42)"

2.5. Marriage of 'Umar to Umm Kulthoom
bint 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (may Allah be
pleased with them)
gave his daughter - whose mother
'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&)
, ,
was Fgtimah, the daughter of the Prophet (g)
- in marriage to
'Umar (&) when 'Umar asked him to do so, because he had great
confidence in him and held him in high esteem. This was an
achowledgement of his good character and a demonstration of the
strong and good relationship that existed between them and the
strong and blessed ties which bum the hearts of the envious enemies
of the Ummah and rub their noses in the dust.154 'Umar felt a special
love for Ah1 al-Bayt that he did not have for anyone else, because of
their closeness to the Messenger of Allah (g)
and because of the
urging of the Messenger of Allah (gJto honour the members of his
family and take care of their rights. Based on this motive, 'Umar
(&) proposed marriage to Umm Kulthoom, the daughter of 'Ali and
Fgtimah (&). 'Umar (&) spoke to 'Ali (&) in a very gentle way,
saying: "By Allah, there is no man on earth that would be so kind to
her as I will be." 'Ali (&) said: "I will do that." 'Umar (&) turned
to the Muhgjireen gladly and said: "Congratulate me." Then he said
that the reason for his marrying her was what he heard from the
Prophet (g):
''All ties and connections will be severed on the Day of
Resurrection except ties and connections to me." He said: "I wanted
to have ties between me and the Messenger of Allah ( B ) . " ' ~ ~
This marriage was confirmed by all historians and
genealogists, and by all the Shia narrators of hadith, jurists,
stubborn persons and their so-called infallible Imams. Shaykh ns2n
Il& maheer quoted a number of reports about that in his book AshShi'ah w a s - ~ u n n a h . 'This
~ ~ marriage was also mentioned by the
Snnni historians, and all their sources are agreed upon it. Among the
scholars who mentioned it were at-~abari"~,Ibn ~atheer'~',adh-

was also mentioned in books of biography, such as Ibn ~ a j a r ' Ibn
~~,
~ a ' d ' " and Asad al-Ghibah. Professor Abu Mu'idh al-Isma'eeli, in
his book Zawiij 'Umar ibn al-Khactrib min Umm Kulthoom bint 'Ali
ibn Abi Tiilib ( r d i y a Alliihu 'anhu)Haqeeqah wa laysa Iftiri' (The
Marriage of 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b to Umm Kulthoom the daughter of
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib is a Fact and not a Fabrication), examined the
reports in the sources of both the Shia and Ah1 asSunnah, and he
refuted the specious arguments that were raised concerning this
blessed marriage. I have written about Umm Kulthoom, including
some of her biography and her deeds at the time of 'Umar (&), in
my book Fajl al-KhitLibfi Seerat Ameer al-Mu'mineen 'Umar ibn alKhanGb: Shakh~iyahchuwu 'Asruhu.
Umm Kulthoorn bint 'Ali bore 'Umar a daughter named
Ruqayyah and a son named Zayd. The companions of Zayd ibn 'Umar
narrated that he was present when a fight broke out one night among
some people fromBanu 'Adiyy ibn Ka'b. Zayd went out to them to try
to reconcile between them; he received a blow that made his head
bleed, and he died instantly. His mother was so aggrieved by his killing
that she immediately fell unconscious and died. Umm Kulthoom and
her son Zayd ibn 'Umar were buried at the same time. Al-Hasan ibn
'Ali ihn Abi T%b made Abdullah ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khagih go
forward to lead the funeral prayer, and he prayed behind him.'65

2.6. "0 daughter of the Messenger of Allah,
no one in this world is dearer to us than
your father, and no one after your father
is dearer to us than you."
It was narrated that Aslam al-'Adawi said: "When allegiance
was sworn to Abu Bakr
after the death of the Prophet (g),
'Ali
and az-Znbayr ibn a l - ' A w w h went to Fztimah
to consult with

(a)

(a)

262

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

her. News of that reached 'Umar (&), and he entered upon Ficimah
(I&) and said: '0 daughter of the Messenger of Allah, no one in this
w&ld is dearer to us than your father, and no one after your Father is
dearer to us than you,' and 11e spoke to her. 'Ali and az-Zubayr came
and she said: 'You may leave. May Allah guide
to Fgtimah
yon.' They didnot come back to her until they had sworn allegiance
(to Ahu ~ a k r ) . " 'This
~ ~ is what is proven and sound; in addition to
the soundness of its chain of narration, it is in hannony with the spirit
of that generation and the fact that Allah (&) praised them.

(a),

The R&@s added to this report and fabricated lies and
falsehoods. They said that 'Umar (&,) said: "If these people meet
with you, I am going to burn this house down with them inside,
because they want to divide the Muslims by delaying their oath of
allegiance." Then he went out, and it was not long before they came
back to her, and she said to them: "Do you know that 'Umar (&)
came to me and swore by Allah (&) that if you returned to this
house, he would burn it down with you inside? By Allah, he will
fulfil his oath, so leave and do not come back to me." So they did
that, and they did not come back to her until after they had sworn
allegiance.16' This story is not proven from 'Umar, and the claims
that 'Umar thought of burning down the house of Fitimah (&)is one
of the lies of the R%@s, the enemies of the companions of the
Messenger of Allah. It was narrated, along with other lies, by at,
Tabari at-Tubrusi in his hook Dal6'il al-~rntrnah,'~~
from Jgbk alJa'fi, who is a lying RZ@ according to the imams of hadith, as it
says in a l - ~ e e z c i nby
' ~ ~adh-Dhahabi and Tahdheeb at-~ahdheeb.'~'
Some of the R%i$is claimed that 'Umar struck Fgtimah (&)
and caused her to miscarry her son Muhsin, who was in her wokb,
but this is another R%i@ lie that has no basis in truth. They failed to
realise that they were implicitly condemning 'Ali (&) by accusing
him of cowardice and keeping quiet about 'Umar (&), when he was
one of the bravest of the Companions of the Prophet (33).171 Indeed,

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

263

even some of the Rificji books deny the soundness of this weird and
false s t o ~ ~ ,knowing
"~
that M+sin was actually horn during the
lifetime of the Prophet (g),
as is proven in sound reports.

2.7. The dispute between al-'Abbss and 'Ali,
and 'Umar's judgement between them
Maik ibn Aws said: "While I was sitting with my family
around the noon hour, the envoy of 'Umar ibn al-Khat&b came to me
and said: 'Amir al-Mn'mineen wants you to come.' So I went with
him and entered upon 'Umar (&), whom I found sitting on a bed of
palm tree leaves, with no blanket between him and the mattress,
reclining on a leather pillow. I greeted him,then I sat down, and he
said: '0 Maik, there has come to us from your people a group from
different families, and I have issued orders that they be given a little
money. Take it and divide it among them.' I said: '0 Amir alMn'mineen, would that yon had ordered someone other than me to
do this.' He said: 'Take it, 0 M a . ' While I was sitting with him, his
doorkeeper Yarfa' came to him and said: 'Will you let 'Uthm&,
'Ahdur-Ramin ibn 'Awf, az-Zubayr and Sa'd ibn Ahi W a q q i ~
come in, as they are asking permission to see yon? He said: 'Yes.'
Permission was given to them, so they entered and greeted him and
sat down. Yarfa' sat down for a while, then he said: 'Will you let 'Ali
and 'Abbh come in?' He said: 'Yes.' So permission was given to
them, and they came in and greeted him and sat down.
"Abbis said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, judge between me and
this man.' They were arguing over what Allah (&) had granted to
His Messenger (@) of the property of Banu an-Nadeer. The group 'Uthmk and his companions - said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, judge
between them and give them relief from one another.' 'Umar (&)
said: 'Wait a moment. I adjure you by Allah, by Whose leave heaven
and earth exist, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said:

264

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

"We prophets are not inherited from; what we leave behind is
charity,' meaning himself?' The group said: 'He did say that.' 'Umar
turned to 'Ali and 'Abbis and said: 'I adjure you by Allah, do you
know that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said that?' They said: 'He did
say that.' 'Umar said: 'Shall I tell you about this matter? Allah gave
this fay' exclusively to His Messenger, and He did not give it to
anyone else.' Then he recited: (And what AUah gave as booty ifay']
Lo His Messenger [Muhammad] from them - for this you made no
expedition with either cavalry or camehy. But Allah gives power to
His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do
all things,# (Qur'an 59: 6)
"He said: 'This was exclusively for the Messenger of Allah

(g),
and by Allah, he did not keep it to himself in exclusion of you,
and he did not prefer himself over you. Rather he gave it to you and
divided it among you until there was nothing left of it except this
property. The Messenger of Allah (g)
spent on his family's needs
from this property every year, then he took what was left and
regarded it as the property of Allah (charity). This is how the
Messenger of Allah (g)
acted throughout his life. I adjure you by
Allah, do you know this?'
"Umar said: 'Then Allah took His Messenger (8)
in death,
and Abu Bakr said: "I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah
(g),"
and Allah knows that he was sincere, righteous and wise,
adhering to the right way in the way he dealt with it. Then Allah took
Abu Bakr (in death) and I am the successor of Abu Balcr, so it was
under my control for two years of my rulership, and I dealt with it as
the Messenger of Allah (g)
and as Abu Bakr did, and Allah knows
that I was sincere, righteous and wise, adhering to the right way in the
way I dealt with it. Then you came to me and spoke to me, and I
spoke to you both when you were in agreement. You came, 0
'Abbk, asking me for your share from your nephew, and this one

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

265

[meaning 'Ali (&)I came to me asking for his wife's share from her
father, and I said to you both that the Messenger of Allah (@) said:
"We prophets are not inherited from; what we leave behind is
charity."
'Then when I decided to put it under your control, I said: "If
you wish, I will give it to you, on the condition that yon will
administer it as the Messenger of Allah (g)
hhad administered it and
as Abu Bakr administered it and as I administered it since I took
charge of it." And you said: "Give it to us." And it was on that basis
that I gave it to you. I adjure you by Allah, did I give it to you on that
basis? The people said: 'Yes.' Then he tumed to 'Ali and 'Abbgs
and said: 'I adjure you by AUah, did I give it to you on that basis?
They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Do you want me to change the deal with
you? For by Allah, by Whose leave heaven and earth exist, I cannot
allow you to administer it in any other way. If you are unable to fulfil
the condition, then give it back to me, and I will take care of it for
"

YOU."' ^^
2.8. Umar's nomination of 'Ali for
the caliphate alongside members of the
consultative committee, and what 'Ali
said about 'Umar after he was martyred
2.8.1. Nomination of 'Ali (&)
, ..
alongside
the members of the consultative committee
When 'Umar (&) thought that he was going to depart this
world, after being stabbed, the Muslims began to enter upon him,
saying: "Give us instructions, 0 Amir al-Mu'rnineen, and appoint a
successor." He said: "I do not think there is anyone more deserving of
that than this group with whom the Messenger of Allah (&) was
pleased when he died." He named six men: 'Ali, 'Uthmh, az-Zubayr,

266

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Talhah, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi? and 'Abdur-Ralpn2n ibn 'Awf (may
Allah be pleased with them).174 Then he summoned the most
prominent among them, namely 'Abdur-Rahmk, 'Uthmh and 'Ali,
and exhorted them.'75 As the ruler, 'Umar (A&) had to appoint a
successor who was the most suited to managing the affairs of the
Muslims. He gave it a great deaI of thought and decided that these six,
with whom the Messenger of Allah (g)
was pleased when he died,
were more capable than others. He was correct, for no one said that
anyone else was more deserving or qualified than them. He left the
issue of appointing the caliph to these people, lest he appoint one of
them and someone else be more qualified. It was clear to him that
these six were more qualified, but he was not sure which one of them
was the most qualified. He said: "The decision is up to these six to
appoint one from their group." This was the view of a just and sincere
mler who was not affected by whims and desires. This is a real life
example of the application of the words of Allah: (Aud who [conduct]
their affairs by mutual consultation,) (Qur'az 42: 38) and (And consult
them in the affairs) (Qur'an 3: 159). The way he did this, by means of
consultation, served the best interests of the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~ ~
'Umar (&) thought that these six were very similar in their
qualifications, even though some of them possessed virtnes that
others did not; one who had a disadvantage in one way had another
advantage that the others did not have. 'Umar thought that if he
appointed one of them, this could result in some shortcomings that
could be athibuted to him, so he refrained from appointing a
successor out of fear of Allah
He realised that there was no one
more qualified for this position other than these people, so he
combined two interests: he nominated them because no one was
more qualified than them, but he refrained from singling out one of
them for fear of shortcoming. AUah (&) obliges His slaves to do
what best serves the interests as much as they can, thus what 'Umar
(&) did was in the best possible intere~1s.l~~
It cannot be said that

(s).

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

267

when he left the matter in the hands of these six members of the
consultative committee, he differed from his predecessors, as the
R%fidi Shia claim, because differing is of two types: it may mean
being contrary or it may refer to a variation. What 'Umar (&) did
was of the second type.17' All the Companions approved of his
decision, and we have not heard of anyone who disagreed with it. I
have discussed in detail the new method invented by 'Umar (4)
for
selecting the caliph who was to succeed him in my book Fa81 alKhigib j? Seerat Ameer al-Mu'mineen 'Umar ibn al-Khatccib:
Shakbiyatuhu wa 'Aqruhu, which may be consulted by those who
wish to know more about it.

2.8.2. What 'Ali (&,) said about 'Umar (&)
after he was martyred
Ibn 'Abbzs said, according to what is narrated by Bukhari:
"Umar ibn al-Khat&b was placed on his bier, and the people gathered
around him praying for him and praising him before he. was lifted up,
and I was among them. Nothing surprised me except a man who
seized my shoulder from behind. I tnmed to him and saw that it was
'Ali (&).
,.
He prayed for mercy for 'Umar (&) and said: 'You have
not left behind anyone with the like of whose deeds I would like to
meet Allah more than you. By Allah, I think that AUah will unite yon
with your two Companions, because I often heard the Messenger of
Allah (B)say, "Abu Bakr, 'Umar and I came; Abu Bakr, 'Umar and
I went in; Abu Bakr, 'Umar and I went out." '

2.8.3. 'Ali's describing 'Umar as wise
and mature, and his keenness not to
go against him after he died
It was narrated that 'Abd Khayr said: ''I was close to 'Ali (&)
when the people of Najrh came. I thought: If he is going to alter

268

'Ali ibn Abi T a b at the time ofthe Rightly Guided Caliphs

anything that 'Umar (&) used to do, he will show it today. They
greeted him and stood before him, then one of them put his hand in
his sleeve and brought out a document, which he placed in 'Ali's
hand. They said: '0Amir al-Mu'mineen, it was written by your hand
and dictated by the Messenger of Allah (g)
to you.' I saw 'Ali (&)
with tears flowing down his cheeks. He looked up at them aud said:
'0 people of Najrk, this is the last letter I wrote in the presence of the
~.They said: 'Give us what is mentioned in
Messenger of Allah (g).'
it.' He said: 'Let me explain it to you. What 'Umar (&) took, he did
not take for himself; rather he took it on behalf of the Muslim
community, and what he took is better than what he gave you. By
Allah, I will not alter anything that 'Umar (&) did, for 'Umar (&)
was wise and mature.,,,180 Based on this incident, the jurists
established the principle that no judge should overturn the verdict of
the judges who came before him, according to 'Ali (&).la' It was
narrated from him that he said: "Judge as you used to judge so that
you will act as one, for I fear division."182 This is the view of the
majority of j~rists."~'Ali said: I would not undo a knot that 'Umar
(&) tied.lX4

2.8.4. "Umar ibn al-Khat&?ib (4)
would not
like to stay there, so I dislike it too"
When 'Ali (&) had finished with the Battle of the Camel, he
entered Basra and then travelled for a short distance with Mother of
the Believers 'A'ishab (I&,), because she wanted to go back to
Makkah. Then he marched from Basra to Kufah, which he entered on
Monday, 12 Rajah 36 AH. It was said to him: "Stay in the white
palace." He said: "No, 'Umar ibn al-KbatGb (&) would not like to
stay there, so I dislike it too." Instead, he stayed in ar-Rahbah and
prayed two raka'ahs in the main mosque.185

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

269

2.8.5. The love of Ah1 al-Bayt for 'Umar (&)
One of the indications of the love that Ah1 al-Bayt had for
'Umar (&) was that they gave his name to their sons out of love and
admiration for his character, in appreciation for his good deeds and
noble attitude, because of the great services that he had rendered to
Islam and as an affirmation of the strong ties of blood, marriage and
friendship that existed between him and AN al-Bayt. The first one to
name his son after him was Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T a i h
(&); his son from Umm Haheeb bint Rahee'ah al-Bakriyyah was
named mar.'^^ In the book Stihib al-Fudool, in a list of the
, .,
it mentions his son 'Umar from
children of 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&),
at-Taghlibiyyah, whose full name was as-Sahba' bint Rabee'ah; she
was one of the female prisoners who were captured by Khilid ibn alWaleed in 'Ayn at-Tamar. This 'Umar lived to the age of eighty-five
and acquired half the estate of 'Ali (&), because all of his brothers
- Abdullah, Ja'far and 'Uthmin - were killed before him, along
with al-Husayn (&). He was not killed with them at at-Taff, so he
inherited from them.Ia7
Al-Hasan followed in 'Ali's footsteps with regard to love for
'Umar ibn al-Khagb (may Allah be pleased with them all), and he
also named one of his sons m mar.'^^ Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali also named
one of his sons 'Umar, and al-Husayn's son 'Ali, who is known as
Zayn alb'ibideen, also gave one of his sons the name 'umar.lS9
Moosa ibn Ja'far, who is known as al-K2&im, gave one of his sons
the name mar.'^^ These are the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt who
followed the trne path of the Prophet (g)
and the way of Ahl asSunnah walJami'ah with their beautiful attitude. They demonstrated
the love they had in their hearts for 'Umar (&), and they remained
loyal to him long after his death.
The names 'Umar, Abu Balcr and 'Uthmk are found among
the offspring of Ahl alBayt who followed the truth, and this is still

270

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

the way of Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah until the present day. We find
the names of the Companions and those of the Mothers of the
Believers among the Hzshimi families who adhered to the Qur'an
and Sunnah, they called their children Talhah, 'Abdur-R&m$n,
'A'ishah and Umm Salamah. We invite the Shia today to follow the
example of 'Ali, d-Hasan, al-Husayn and all the Imams of Ah1 alBayt, and name some of their sons and daughters after the RightlyGuided Caliphs and the Mothers of the ~elievers.'~'This is
something that we hope for.

2.8.6. Allah ($) made 'Umar ibn al-Khat.fSb (&)
a cause of the survival of the offspring
of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib
When 'Umar ibn al-Khatrzb (&) received the booty from
Persia, he gave the daughter of Yazdagird, the King of Persia, to alHusayn ibn 'ALi (&). She bore him Zayn &'.&hideen 'Ali ihn alHusayn, who was the only one his sons to survive. AU the
descendants of al-Husayn are descended from Zayn al-'Ahideen.'92
Let those beware who slander 'Umar ihn al-Khagh (&)
. . while
claiming descent from al-Husayn, because were it not for 'Umar
(&), after Allah (g),
they would not have existed.Ig3 Moreover,
'Umar (4)
gave her sister in marriage to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr,
so he was a brother-in-law of al-Husayn, and she bore him al-QLim
ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bdu. This means that al-Qzsim ibn
Mul~ammadihn Abi Bakr and 'Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn alLZAbideen
were maternal cousins.'94

2.8.7. What Abdullah ibn al-Hasan
said about marl^^
It was narrated that Hafs ibn Qays said: "I asked Abdullah ihn
d-Hasan about wiping over the leather socks, and he said: 'Wipe

'Ali ibn Abi T a b

271

over them, because 'Umar ihu al-Kha~sh(&) wiped over them.' I
said: 'I am asking you - do you wipe over them?' He said: 'May
you be doomed! I tell you about 'Umar (&) and you ask me about
my opinion! 'Umar (&) was an earthful better than me.' I said: '0
Abu Mu]?ammad, some people are claiming that this is taqiyyah on
your part.' He said to me - when we were between the grave and the
minbar [in Madinah] - 'By Allah, this is my opinion in private and
in public. Do not listen to anyone who says anything about me that is
different from what I am telling you.' Then he said: 'Who is this who
claims that 'Ali (&) was suppressed, and that the Messenger of
Allah (g)told him to do something and he did not do it? What a
great undermining and criticism of 'Ali (&) it is to suggest that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
told him to do something and he did not
cany it out.""96

3. 'Ali (&) at the time of
'Uthmgn ibn 'Affgn
3.1. 'Ali's oath of allegiance to 'Uthmsn (&)
The people had barely finished burying 'Umar ihn al-KhatGb

(4)
when the consultative committee and the members of the high
council of state hastened to meet in the house of 'A'ishah (I&), the
Mother of the Believers (or it was said that they met in the house of
Fgtimah bint Qays al-Fihriyyah, the sister of ad-D*ik
ihn Qays) in
order to decide the most impoaant issue facing the Musl~msafter the
death of 'Umar (&).
. ., The people spoke and gave their opinions, and
they were guided by the help of Allah (&) to reach an agreement that
was accepted by prominent and ordinruy Muslims alike.L97

272

'Ali ibn Abi Ta'lih at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

The consultative process and the selection of the caliph were
supervised by ' A b d u r - R b i n ibn 'Awf (&), who demonstrated
the consultative process in a systematic fashion for the first time in
selecting the one who would bear the burdens of caliphate and
manage the affairs of the Muslims. He resorted to a method of great
deliberation, patience, resolve and proper management that
guaranteed him success in fulfilling his great mission.'98 He led the
consultative council in a skilful and unbiased manner that deserves
the greatest respect.199 Adh-Dhahabi said: "Among the best deeds of
'Ahdur-Rwere his withdrawal from the race at the time of
consultation and his choosing for the Ummah the one recommended
by the people of prominence and evidence. He performed his mission
in the best manner and united the Ummah behind 'Uthmin (&). If
he had been biased, he would have taken the caliphate for himself or
he would have appointed his cousin and the closest of the people to
him, Sa'd ibn Abi ~ a q q i $ . " ~ ~ ~
There was unanimous agreement that allegiance would be
sworn to 'Uthmh (&) following the dawn prayer on the chosen
day, which was the last day of Dhul-Hijah 23 AH/ 6 November 644
CE. Suhayb ar-Roomi was leading the prayer when 'Abdw-R&m&
ibn 'Awf came, wearing the turban that the Messenger of Allah (g)
had put on his head. The men of the consultative committee had
gathered by the minbar, and he sent for those of the Muhijireen,
An$% and army commanders who were present, among whom were
Mu'iwiyah the govemor of Syria, 'Umayr ibn Sa'd the governor of
Homs and 'Amr ihn al-'A$ the govemor of Egypt. They had gone for
hajj with 'Umar (&) and had come with him to adi in ah."'
According to the report of Bukhari: "When the people had prayed the
dawn prayer, and those men (the consultative committee) had
gathered by the minbar, he sent for those of the Mnhijireen and
An$& who were present and the commanders of the m y , who had

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

273

come to perfom hajj with 'Umar (&). When they had gathered,
'Abdur-R@h recited the the testimony of faith [that there is none
worthy of worship other than Allah, that He has no partners, and that
is His Slave and Messenger], then he said: '0 'Ali, I
Muhammad (g)
have spoken to the people and asked for their opinions, and I do not
believe that they think anyone is as good as 'Uthmh (&), but do
not give anyone a reason to criticise you (by expressing disagreement
with the majority).' 'Abdur-Rahmh said (to 'Uthmh): 'I swear
allegiance to you in accordance with the way of Allah and His
Messenger and the two caliphs who came after him.' So the people
swore allegiance to him; they included the Muhsjireen, the An$%,the
commanders of the army and the other ~ u s l i m s . "According
~~~
to
the report of the author of at-Tamheed wal-Bay&, 'Ali ibn Abi T a b
was the first one to swear allegiance after 'Abdur-R&rnzn ibn
'AW~.~'~

3.2. Rgfidi myths that have been inserted
into the story of the consultative committee
There are many R%i& myths that have been inserted into
Islamic history concerning the story of the consultative committee
and the selection of 'Uthmh (&) for the caliphate. These reports
were then picked up by the ~ r i e k l i s t swho
,
circulated them further.
Many modem historians and thinkers have been influenced by them,
without examining the reports or checking their chains of
transmission and texts, and thus they have become widespread
among the Muslims.
The RBidi Shia historians gave their attention to the story of
the consultation and the appointment of 'Uthmh ibn 'Affan (&) as
caliph, and they inserted lies and false ideas. Some of them wrote
entire books on this topic; Abu Makhnaf wrote a book entitled Kitlb
ash-Shoora, and Ibn 'Uqdah and Ibn B2bawayh also wrote similar

274

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time uf the Rightly Guided Caliphs

books.'" Ibn Sa'd narrated nine reports via al-W2qidi about the
consultative committee, the oath of allegiance to 'Uthmiin (&) and
the story of how he was appointed caliph.205 He narrated another
report via 'Ubaydullah ibn Moosa that included the murder of 'Umar
(&), his limiting the committee to six men, his advice to both 'Ali
and 'Uthmiin if either of them were to be appointed caliph, and his
advice to Suhayb regarding this matter?06
Al-Baliidhuri narrated reports about the committee and the
oath of allegiance to 'Uthmiin (&) from Abu MakhnafZo7, from
H i s h h al-Kalbi (some of which was quoted from Abu Makhnaf and
some of which was narrated only by him)208,from a l - ~ i ~ i d and
i'~~
from 'Ubaydullah ibn Moosa?" At-Tabari based his version of this
story on a number of reports, such as that of Abu Makhnaf?" lbn
Abil-Hadeed narrated some of the events via Ahmad ibn 'Abdul'Azeez al-~awhari,~"
and he mentioned that he was quoting from the
book ash-Shoora by a l - ~ 2 ~ i d i .The
" ~ Sbia reports include a number
of interpolations for which there is no sound evidence, including:

3.2.1. Accusation against the Companions of
favouritism in issues concerning the Muslims
The R Z d i Shia reports accuse the Companions of favomitism
in issues conceming the Muslims and suggest that 'Ali (&) was not
happy about 'Abdur-Ralpn% choosing the caliph. It was narrated by
Abu Makhnaf and Hishim al-Kalbi, from his father and &mad alJawhari, that 'Umar (&) gave the deciding vote, in the event of an
equal split, to 'Abdur-Ribn 'Awf, so 'Ali (&) realized that
the caliphate had slipped from his grasp because 'Abdur-Remiin
would choose 'Uthmk (&), to whom he was related by
marriage?14 However, Ibn Taymiyah denied that there was any close
relationship by blood between 'Uthmiin and ' A b d u r - R w . He
said: " A b d u r - R W k was not a brother or cousin of 'Uthmk, and he

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

275

was not from the same clan at all. Rather, one was from Banu Zuhrah,
and the other was from Banu Umayyah, and Banu Zuhrah were
closer to Banu Hhhim than Banu Umayyah. Banu Zuhrah were
maternal uncles of the Prophet (g),
including 'Ahdur-R*mk ihn
'Awf and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis, of whom the Prophet (g)
said: 'This
is my maternal uncle; who dares to compare his maternal uncle to
mine?~'215The Prophet (g)
did not establish brotherhood between
one Muhijir and another, or between one A n ~ i r iand another, rather
he established brotherhood between the Muhijireen and the An&.
He established brotherhood between ' A b d u r - R w k ibn 'Awf and
Sa'd ibn ar-Rabee' a l - ~ n ~ i k i ?This
' ~ hadith is well known and
established in the books of authentic hadiths and elsewhere, and all
the scholars know that.217 The Shia based their reports of 'AhdurR b i n ' s favouring 'Uthmin on the fact that they were related by
marriage, hut they forgot that the ties of blood are stronger than ties
through marriage. They also forgot the nature of the relationship
among the believers in the first generation of Islam, and that it was
based on neither ties of blood nor ties through marriage. The way in
which ' A b d u r - R b i n and 'Uthmiin were related through marriage
was that ' A b d u r - R b i n was married to Umm Kalthoom bint
'Uqbah ibn Ahi Mu'eet, the sister of a l - ~ a l e e d . ~ "

3.2.2. The party of Banu Umayyah
and the party of Banu HSshim
The report of Abu Makhnaf suggests that there was a dispute
between Bann Hishim and Banu Umayyah during the swearing of
allegiance, but this is not trne. It is not mentionedin any report, sound
or weak.'19 Some historians were influenced by the reports of the
RiXdi Shia and based their incorrect analysis on these reports, so
they portrayed the discussion among the Companions of the
Messenger (g)
about the appointment of the new caliph as a tribal

276

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

dispute, saying that the people divided into two groups, the party of
Banu Umayyah and the party of Banu Hbhim. This is an imaginary
idea and incorrect conclusion for which there is no evidence at all,
because that is not the kind of atmosphere in which the Companions
of the Messenger of Allah (g)were living where one of the
Muhijiroon would stand with an An@i against his own father or
brother or cousin or tribe. It ignores the fact that these Companions
are the ones who sacrificed all worldly gains in order to protect their
religion. It is not based on sound knowledge of these elite who had
been given the glad tidings of paradise. There are many events in
their lives which prove that these people were far above looking at
things from such a narrow perspective when dealing with their
affairs. It was not a matter of family or tribal representation; they
were appointed to the consultative council because of their status in
Islam.

3.2.3. Words that were falsely attributed to 'Ali (&)
lhn Katheer said: "What is said by many historians, such as
lbu Jareer and others, who narrated from unknown men about 'Ali
saying to 'Abdur-RaFmiin: 'You deceived me; you only
appointed him because he is related to you through marriage and so
that he would seek your advice every day,' and that he did not swear
allegiance to 'Uthmh (&>) until 'Abdur-Ramin ibn 'Awf said,
d ~ e r i l ythose
,
who give Bay 'ah [pledge] to you [O Muhammad] they
are giving Bay 'ah [pledge] to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their
hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own
harm; and whosoever fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah, He
will bestow on him a great reward) (Qur'an 48: 10) is false."

(4)

There are other reports that are contrary to what is proven in
the books of authentic hadiths; they are to be rejected and thrown
back at those who narrate them. And Allah (g)
knows best. What is

'Ali ibn Ahi Tirlib

277

to be expected from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them) is utterly different from the ideas of many of the RZfis and
narrators of strange stories, who cannot distinguish between sound
and weak reports.220

3.3. Ruling on preferring 'Ali over 'Uthmiin
(may Allah be pleased with them both)
The view of Ah1 as-Sunnah is that the one who prefers 'Ali
over Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) is a
misguided innovator, and the one who prefers 'Ali over 'Uthmk is
mistaken, but they did not regard him as misguided or an
innovator.221One of the scholars spoke harshly about the one who
prefers 'Ali over 'Uthmk, though, saying: "The one who prefers 'Ali
over 'Uthmin is claiming that the Companions of the Messenger (s)
betrayed the bust when they chose 'Uthm2n over ' ~ l i . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah said: "Ah1 as-Sunnah are agreed that 'Uthmin
(&)is of a higher status, although this issue -the issue of 'Uthmsn
and 'Ali - is not a basic issue such that the one who differs
concerning it is regarded as misguided, according to the majority of
Ah1 as-Sunnah. The issue concerning which the one who differs is
regarded as misguided is the issue of caliphate. That is because they
believe that the caliph after the Messenger of Allah
was Abu
Bakr, then 'Umar, then 'Uthmk, then 'Ali, and whoever criticizes
the caliphate of any of these leaders is more misguided than his
people's donkey. "223

He mentioned the comments of the scholars about the issue of
preferring 'Ali over 'Uthmk, concerning which there are two
reports:
'*

The first is that this is not acceptable. The one who prefers
'Ali over 'Uthmk (may Allah be pleased with them) has

278

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

transgressed beyond the Sunnah and introduced an
innovation, because he disagreed with the consensus of the
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Hence it
was said that the one who prefers 'Ali over 'Uthmh has
thought badly of the Muhzjireen and the Ansk. This was
narrated from more than one scholar, including Ayyoob
as-Sakhtiyhi, m a d ibn Hanbal and ad-Dkaqumi.
*:

The second view is that the one who prefers 'Ali (&) is
not to be regarded as an innovator, because 'Uthmh and
'Ali are so close in ~ t a t n s . ~ ' ~

3.4. 'Ali (&) carried out hadd punishments
and was consulted with regard to matters
of state during the rule of 'Uthmgn (&)
3.4.1. 'Ali's carrying out hadd punishments
during the rule of ' U t h m h (&)
It was narrated that Husayn ibn al-Mundhir said: "I was with
'Uthmh ibn 'Affh (&) when d-Wdeed was brought to him, and
two men bore witness against him. One of them was Humrin, who
said that he had drunk wine, and the other testified that he vomited.
'Uthmh
said: 'He would not have vomited unless he drank it.'
He said: '0 'Ali, get up and whip him.' 'Ali (&) said: '0 Hasan, get
up and whip him.' Al-Hasan said: 'Let those who are enjoying the
position of leadership carry out the punishment.' It was as if he ('Ali)
got upset with him and he said: '0 Abdullah ihn Ja'far! Get up and
whip him.' So he whipped him, and 'Ali (&) counted until he had
reached forty, then be said: 'Stop.' Then he said: 'The Prophet ($@
gave forty lashes, and Abu Bakr gave forty, and 'Umar (&) gave
eighty. All are Snnnah, but this is dearer to me."'225

(4)

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

279

It may be understood from this hadith that 'Ali (&) was close
to 'Uthmiin (&) and helped him to obey Allah (&). ' A i
used
to say, when defending 'Uthmih (&) and refuting the criticisms
against him because of the actions attributed to al-waledzz6: "The
way you criticize 'Uthmiin (&) is Wte one who stabs himself to kill
his help. What is the mistake of 'Uthm2n (&) with regard to a man
on whom he carried out the punishment because of his actions and
dismissed him from his post? What error did 'Uthmiin (&) make
when he acted on our advi~e?"~"

(4)

3.4.2. 'Uthmh's consulting 'Ali and

the senior Companions with regard to
the conquest of North Africa
In R i y d an-Nufoos,it is narrated that word reached Amir alMu'mineen 'Uthmk ibn 'Affiin from his governor in Egypt,
Abdullah ibn Sa'd, that the Muslims sometimes raided the borders of
North Africa and inflicted damage on their enemies, and that their
enemies were close to where the Muslims were located. As a result of
that, 'Uthmk ibn 'Affiin (&) expressed to al-Miswar ibn
Makhramah his wish to send the armies to conquer North Africa. AlMiswar ibn Makhramah narrated: ''['UhGn (&) said:] 'What is
your opinion, 0 Ibn Makhramah? I said: 'conq;er them.' He said:
'Assemble the senior Companions of the Messenger of Allah today,
so that I can seek their advice; whatever they agree on, I will do, or
whatever most of them agree on, I will do.' I saw 'Ali, Talhah, azZubayr and d-'Abb2s [and he mentioned some of them]. 'UthmSm
conversed with each one on his own in the mosque, then he
summoned Abu d-A'war (Sa'eed ibn Zayd) and said to him: 'Why
did you - 0 Abu al-A'war - object to sending the troops to North
Africa?' He said: 'I heard 'Umar (&,) say, "I will never send any
Muslims to conquer it as long as I am alive," and I do not think that
you should go against 'Umar's decision.' 'Uthmiin said to him: 'By

280

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at ihe time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Allah, we do not fear them, and they will be more than happy to be
left alone in their land with no one bothering them.' None of those
from whom 'Uthm2n sought advice differed with him. Then he
addressed the people and urged them to join the campaign to North
Africa. Some of the Companions went out on this campaign,
including Abdullah ibn az-Zuhayr and Ahu Dharr a l - ~ h i f i i r i . " ~ ~ ~

3.4.3. 'Ali's view on 'Uthmsn's uniting
the people on one Qur'anic recitation
' U t h d (&,) assembled the Muhijireen and the An& and
consulted them with regard to this matter. Among this group were the
most prominent Companions, foremost among whom was 'Ali ibn
Abi T2ih (&). 'Uthmb (&)presented this topic to the elite of the
Ummah and its leaders who were guided and were beacons of
guidance. He discussed the issue with them, and they discussed it
with him, until he found out their view, and they came to know his
view. What they agreed upon became known to people throughout
the land, and it is not known that anyone opposed their decision or
objected to this idea. The issue of the Qur'an is not something that
could he hidden from any ordinary member of the Ummah, let alone
the scholars and prominent figures.2z9
'UthmZn (&)
. .. did not introduce any innovations when
collecting the Qur'an because Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) had done it
before him. 'Uthm2n did not decide this matter by himself; he did it
in consultation with the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them), who approved of this action and said it was a good idea. They
also said that he did well with regard to what he did with the
m ~ ~ h a fMns'ab
s . ~ ~ ibn
~ Sa'd met the Companions of the Prophet
(@) when 'Uthmb burned the (other) mushafs, and he saw that they
were impressed by this action of his.231 'Ali (&) used to rebuke
those who criticized 'Uthm2n (&) for that, and he used to say: "0

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

281

people, do not go to extremes (in criticising) 'Uthm2n, and do not say
anything but good about him, for by Allah, he did not do what he did
(to the Mushafs) except on the basis of the agreement of us all meaning the Companions. If I were in his position, I would have done
the same as he did."232 According to another report from 'Ali (&),
he said: "When the people differed concerning the Qnr'an, and news
of that reached 'Uthmik, he assembled us, the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah, and consulted us with regard to uniting the
people on one recitation, and we agreed with him conceming that."
After that he said: "If I were in his position, I would have done the
same as he did."233

3.5. 'Ali's attitude conceming the
turmoil faced by 'UthmSn
(may Allah be pleased with them both)
There were various, interconnected reasons that contributed to
the murder of 'Uthm2n (&), such as prosperity and its effect on
society, the nature of social changes, the fact that 'Uthmzn came after
'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), the departure of the
senior Companions from Madinah, ignorant tribalism, the conspiracy
of those who bore grndges, the careful preparation of plots against
'Uthmk, the use of means and methods to provoke the people and
the role of the Saba'is in bringing about turmoil. I have discussed
these causes in detail in my book Tayseer al-Kareem al-Mannrinfi
Seerat 'Uthmrin ibn 'Affin -Shakhjitayatuhu wa 'Ajruhu (available
in English translation as The Biography of 'Uthmin ibn 'Affin:
Dhun-Noorayn).
In stirring up the unrest that led to the murder of 'Uthrnk
(&), the enemies of Islam used various means of provocation and
incitement, such as spreading rnmonrs which became numerous and
widespread, inciting people, debating and arguing with the caliphs in

282

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

front of the people, criticising the governors, and using forged letters
which were falsely attributed to the Companions, including 'A'ishah,
'Ali, Ta&ah and az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them all).
They also spread the rnmour that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) was more
entitled to the caliphate, and that he had been appointed as the heir to
succeed the Messenger of Allah (@J. They organised groups in
Basra, Kufah and Egypt, four groups in each region, which is
indicative of prior planning. They gave the impression to the people
of Madinah that they had only come at the invitation of the
Companions, and they fabricated the events that led to the murder.234
In addition to these methods, they also used a number of slogans such
as the takbeer (Allihu akbar, Allah is the most great). They claimed
that their campaign was against injustice, that they were only
enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and that this was
a demand to change and dismiss some governors. Then their
demands escalated until they called for the dismissal of 'Uthmin
(&). They went so far in their audacity that they hastened to kill the
caliph, especially when news reached them that the people of the
regions were coming to support him. Their crazed enthusiasm led to
their tightening the stranglehold on the caliph and their efforts to kill
him by any means.235
The Saba'i organization, led by the Jew Abdullah ibn Saba',
was behind these events and what came after them. We will discuss
this more below, and we will discuss the murder of 'Uthmgn, which
shook the Muslim world and affected many events until the present
day.

3.5.1. 'Ali's attitude at the beginning of the turmoil
'ALi (&) continued with his usual attitude towards the
caliphs, which was to hear and obey and to offer sincere advice. He
himself expressed the extent of his obedience to the caliph 'Uthmin

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

283

(&), and how he followed his commands even when it was difficult

to do so, when he said: "If 'Uthm2n sent me to Sir&, I would hear and
obey."236
When the rebels camped in Dhul-Marwah, approximately one
and a half months before the murder of 'Uthmk (&), 'Uthmk
(&) sent 'Ali (&) and another man, whom the reports do not name,
to meet with them. 'Ali (&) said to them: "Why not resolve all the
issues on the basis of the Book of Allah, and all your objections will
he dealt with?", and they agreed to that.z37 According to another
report, they argued with him two or three times, then they said to
themselves: "He is the cousin of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the
envoy of the caliph, who is offering to resolve the issue on the basis
of the Book of Allah," and they accepted that.238They agreed on five
things: the one who was banished would be allowed to return, the one
who was deprived of his share would be given it, the fay' would be
divided, there would he fairness in the way things were distributed,
and people of honesty and capability would he appointed as
governors. They wrote in the document that lbn ' k r was to be
restored as governor of Basra and that Abu Moosa would remain as
governor of ~ u f a h . 'Thus
~ ~ 'Uthmk (&) reached a deal with each
delegation on its own, and each delegation returned to its
homeland.240
After this treaty was drawn up and the people of the regions
returned home content, it became apparent to those who sought to
create dissent that their plan had failed and that their vile aims had not
been achieved. Hence they drew up a new plan to revive the turmoil
and make it stronger, and they hoped this would lead to destroying
the deals between 'Uthmk (&)
,.
and the people of various regions.
This plan was manifested in the following ways:
As the Egyptian delegation was travelling homeward, they saw
someone riding a camel; he repeatedly approached them and then

284

Xli ibn Abi Ttlib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

moved away, as if he was fleeing from them and wanting them to
capture him. They caught him and asked: "What is the matter with
yon?" He said: "I am the envoy of the caliph to his agent in Egypt."
They examined him and found a letter addressed to the governor; it
bore 'Uthmin's seal but was a forgery. When they opened it, they
found that it contained orders to crucify them or kill them, or cut off
their hands and feet. They went back to adi in ah,^^' but 'Uthmh
(&) denied ever writing this letter. He sajd to them: 'There are two
ways you can reach a verdict; either bring two Muslim men to testify,
or accept my oath by Allah (g),
besides Whom there is no other god,
that I did not write it or dictate it or have any knowledge of it. A letter
may be attributed to a man and a seal may be put on it." But they did
not believe him.242
This letter, which the hateful rebels claimed was from
'Uthm2n (&), bore his seal and was carried by his slave on one of
the zak* camels to his governor in Egypt, Ibn Abis-Sa&, ordering
him to kill these rebels. It was a forged letter that was falsely
This is clear for a number of reasons,
attributed to 'Uthm2n
including the

(a).

The Iraqis were in the east, and the Egyptians were in the west,
yet they all came back at the same time, as if they had an
appointment. How did the Iraqis know about this matter when they
had set out for their own country and were separated from the
Egyptians - who intercepted this fabricated letter - by a huge
distance? That could not have happened unless those who fabricated
the letter and hired someone to cany it and play his role in al-Buwayb
with the Egyptians had also hired another rider to go and tell the
Iraqis that the Egyptians had discovered a letter sent by 'Uthrnh
(&) with instructions to kill the Egyptian rebels. This is what 'Ali
ibn Abi T2lib (&)
. ., was thinking when he said: "0 people of Kufah
and Basra, how did you know what had happened to the people of

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib

285

Egypt, when you had travelled a long distance, then you came
In fact, 'Ali (&) was certain about that and said: "By
Allah, this was a plan that was drawn up in adi in ah.""^
This cursed letter was not the first letter fabricated by these
criminals. They also fabricated letters that were attributed to the
Mothers of the Believers, as well as 'Ali, Talhah and az-Zubayr.
'kishah (@&)was accused of having written to the people, telling
them to rebel against 'Uthmin (&), but she denied it and said: "No,
by the One in Whom the believers believe, and in Whom the
disbelievers disbelieve, I never wrote anything to them until I sat here
where I am."246
Al-A'mash commented: "They thought that it had been falsely
attributed to
The delegates accused 'Ali (&) of having
written to them, telling them to come to Madinah, but he denied that
and swore: "By Allah, I did not write any letter to

had been cormpied
and abandoned and stating that jihad in Madinah was better than
staying in remote outposts, were also attributed to the

commented on this report by
saying: "This is a lie against the Companions, and the letters were
fabrications against them. Fabricated letters that were attributed to
'Ali, Talhah and az-Zubayr, which they denied, were sent to the
rebels - the killers of 'Uthmiin (&). This letter was also falsely
attributed to 'Uthm2n (&);
be did not tell anyone to write it for him,
, .,
and be was not aware of it."Z50 The words of Ibn Katheer are
confumed by the report of at-Tabari, as quoted by Khaleefah, which
says that the senior Companions themselves - 'Ali, 'i'ishah and azZubayr - denied these letters, according to the most sound
reports.251

286

'Ali ibn Abi Tlilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

The criminals who fabricated these letters and attributed them
falsely to the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are the
same ones who fanned the flames of turmoil from beginning to end
and stirred up all the far-reaching corruption. They are the ones who
invented and propagated all these lies against 'UthmSm (&) and
tried to spread them among the people, until the hooligans began to
accept them. Then they forged that letter which they attributed to
'Uthmin (&), so that 'Uthmin (&) would end up as a victim and
thus become, a blessed martyr.
But the m-r
'UthrnSm (4)
was not the only victim of this
Saba'i conspiracy. Islam itself was a victim before that, and the many
generations who leamed that distorted history were also victims of
this evil Jew and his helpers, who were motivated by greed, whim
and desires, and grudges. Is it not time for the Muslims to learn the
truth about their history and its great men? Rather, is it not time for
contemporary Muslim writers to fear Allah (&) and not have the
audacity to criticize the innocent before examining the reports and
investigating thoroughly, so that they do not fall into the same trap as
others?z52

3.5.2. 'Ali's attitude during the siege
The siege against 'Uthmin (&) intensified until he was even
prevented from attending prayers in the mosque, but he bore this
calamity with patience, as the Messenger of Allah (g)
had
commanded him to do. Guided by his strong belief in the divine wiU
and decree, be tried to find a solution to this calamity. Sometimes he
addressed the people and told them of the sanctity of Muslim blood,
and that it was not permissible to shed it except as dictated by Sharia.
At other times, he highlighted his virtues and great services to Islam,
calling as witnesses those who remained of the ten who bad been
given the glad tidings of paradise (may Allah be pleased with

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

287

them).253It was as if he was saying: If a person's actions and virtues
are like this, is it possible that he could have worldly ambitions and
give them precedence over the hereafter? Does it make sense that he
would betray the trust and tamper with the wealth of ihe Ummah and
the lives of its people, knowing what consequences that will have for
him before Allah (B),
when he is one who was taught and educated
by the Prophet (@I,
when the Prophet (@) is the one who testified to
his virtues and praised him, as did the senior Companions? Is this the
proper way to treat such a man?
But the rebel siege of Madinah intensified until the insurgents
were leading the people in prayer most of the time.z54 The
Companions realised that the situation was not as they thought, and
they feared that something might happen that would lead to bad
consequences. They had heard that the people wanted to kill 'Uthmgn
(&I,
so they offered to defend him and expel the thugs from
Madinah, but he refused to allow blood to be shed on his account.255
The senior Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) sent their
sons to defend 'Uthmh (&) without asking him; among them were
al-Hasan ibn 'Ali and Abdullah ibn az-Znbayr (&). Some of the
reports state that al-Hasan was carried wounded from the
and others were also wounded, namely AbduUah ibn az-Zubayr,
Muhammad ihn Hitib and Marwin ibn al-Hakam. Al-Husayn ibn
'Ali and Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) were also with
them.257
'Ali (&)
the most of all the people,
. ., defended 'Uthmh (4)
as Marwih ihn al-Hakam te~tified.~"He was one of the closest of
people to 'Uthmh (&), and he remained close to him throughout
that painful and harsh turmoil. Ibn 'As%ir narrated from Jibir ibn
Abdullah (&) that 'Ali (&) sent word to 'Uthmh (&), saying: "I
have five hundred armed fighters with me; give me permission so
that I can protect you against those people. You have not done

288

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib at the time ofthe Rightly Guided Caliphs

anything to make it permissible to shed your blood." 'Uthmin (&)
replied: "May you be rewarded with good; I would not like blood to
he shed on my account."z59 Numerous reports have been narrated
indicating that 'Ali stood beside 'Uthm2n (may AUah be pleased with
both) during the siege. For example, when the rebels withheld water
from 'Uthmh (&) until his family almost died of thirst, 'Ali (&)
sent him three skins filled with water. A number of the freed slaves of
Banu Hbhim and Bauu Umayyah were wounded trying to deliver
the water skins, but they did not give up until the water reached
him?'
Events followed one after another until the criminals pounced
on 'Uthm2n and killed him (may AUah be pleased with him and make
him pleased). News of that reached the Companions when most of
them were in the mosque, and they lost their minds with grief. 'Ali
(&) said to his sons and nephews, "How could 'Uthmzn (&)
. ., be
killed when you were at the door?" He slapped al-Hasan, who had
been wounded,261struck the chest of al-Husayn, and reviled the son
of az-Zubayr and the son of Tabah. Then he went out angrily to his
house, saying: "May you perish and be doomed forever. 0 AUah, I
declare myself innocent before You of his blood. I was not part of his
murder and did not support his murder in any
This was the
attitude of 'Ali (&), sincere in offering advice and consultation,
hearing and obeying, standing firmly by the side of 'Uthmin (&)
during the turmoil and defending him the most among the people. He
never said anything negative about him; he tried to bring about
reconciliation and bridge the gap between the caliph and the rebels,
but the matter was beyond his control. It was the will of Allah (&)
that Amir al-Mu'mineeu 'Uthm2n ibn 'Affh (&) should attain
martyrdom.263

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

289

3.5.3. Ties of marriage between the family
of 'Ali (&) and the family of 'Uthmgn (&)
There were no feelings of resentment, hatred, or enmity
between Banu Hishim and Banu Umayyab such as those fabricated
and invented by the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, who made up
myths and tales about that. It is clear to every fair-minded individual
that the relationship between Banu Umayyah and Banu Hishim was
that of cousins, brothers and close friends. They were the closest of
people to one another, between whom there was mutual love,
appreciation and respect, and they shared grief, pain and sorrow.
Banu Umayyah and Banu H2shim were descendants of a common
ancestor; they were the grandsons of a single grandfather and
branches of a single tree both before and after Islam. They all sprang
from the same origin and were nourished by the fruits of the religion
of Allah (&)that was brought by the Messenger of AUah (g),
the
trustworthy one, the teacher, the seal of the prophets and messengers.
There was a legendary friendship between Abu S u f y k and al' ~ b b h ' ~as~ well
,
as ties through marriage, both before and after
Islam. The Messenger of Allah (@) gave three of his four daughters
in marriage to men of Bann Umayyah: one married Abu al-'AS ibn
ar-Rabee', and two of his daughters married 'Uthmzn ibn ' A f f h ibn
~ b i l - A ibn
S Umayyah, whose maternal grandmother was the paternal
aunt of the Messenger of Allah (g),
alBayda' bint 'Abdul-Mutwb.
She was called Umm Hakeem, and she had given birth to twins at the
same time as the Prophet's father, Abdullah ibn 'Abdul-Muwib,
was born. One of these twins was Arwa bint Kurayz ibn Habeeb ibn
'Abd Shams, the mother of 'Uthmib (&). The son of 'Uthm2n ibn
'(&), A b k , also married a woman from Banu Hishim; he
married Umm Kulthoom, who was the daughter of Abdullah ibn
Ja'far (at-Tayy2r) ibn Abi Tilib, the brother of 'Ali (may Allah be
pleased with them all).265 Sakeenah, the granddaughter of 'Ali (&)

290

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

and daughter of al-Husayn, was married to the grandson of 'Uthmh
(&), Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn 'Uthmin (may Allah be pleased with them
all). The second granddaughter of 'Ali, another daughter of alHusayn, F s m a h , was manied to another grandson of 'Uthmin,
Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Uthmh ibn 'Af&. Umm
Habeebah, the daughter of Abu S,the chief of Banu Umayyah,
was manied to the chief of Banu Hgshim and the leader of the sons of
Adam, the Messenger of Allah (g),
as is well known. Hind bint Abi
Sufyin was manied to al-H%ith ibn Nawfal ibn a l - H i t h ibn 'AbdulMugalib ibn Hhhim, and she bore him his son ~ u h a n n n a d . ' ~ ~

I have listed just some of the maniages between the two tribes,
and this is sufficient for one who seeks the truth and proper
understanding.27z

3.6. Sayings of 'Ali about the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs
There is consensus on the legitimacy of the caliphates of Abu
Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmin and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all).

Xli ibn Abi Tiilib

291

The Companions were all agreed on that, and whoever criticises any
one of them has gone against the words of Allah (&):
%Andwhoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger [Muhammad]
after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other
than the believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he haschosen,
and burn him in hell - what an evil destination!) (Qur'an 4: 115)
Such a person also denies the words of the Prophet (g):
"I
urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs; hold on to it M y . " They are Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmb
and 'Ali (may Allah he pleased with them) and those who followed
them in trnthF3 How good are the words of Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyiini in
this context, when he said: "Whoever loves Ahu Bakr has established
true faith; whoever loves 'Umar, his path has become clear; whoever.
loves 'Uthmiin has been guided by the light of Allah (g);
whoever
loves 'Ali has grasped the firm handhold; and whoever speaks well of
the Companions of Muhammad (g)is free of
The poet said:
I am pleased with 'Ali as an example and guide,
as I am pleased with Abu Bakr,
the companion of (the Prophet) in the cave.
I am pleased with Abu Haj$ ('Umar) and his party,
and I am not pleased with the slaying of 'Uthmin in the house.
All of the Companions for me are examples and guides.
Is there anything wrong with my saying this?
I f You know that I only love them for Your sake,
then p e e me , h m the

There is definitive evidence and clear proof of the distinct
relationship between 'Ali and the Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah
be pleased with them). This has been explained in the previous pages,
and here we will add some further evidence to the definitive proof

292

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

that has been quoted above of the status of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs in the opinion of Amir al-Mu'miueen 'Ali (&).

3.6.1. The leader of the mature people
and youth of paradise
It was narrated that 'Ah (&) said: "I was with the Prophet
(&), and Abu Bakr and 'Umar came. He said: '0 'Ali, these two are
the leaders of the mature people and youth of paradise, after the
prophets and messengers. z r r 2 7 6

3.6.2. I only think of them
in the way I hope to be
It was narrated that Suwayd ibn Ghaflah said: "I passed by a
group of the Shia who were reviling Abu Bakr and 'Umar, then I
entered upon 'Ali (&) and said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, I passed by
a group of your companions just now who were reviling Abu Balir
and 'Umar in a way that is not befitting to their stahls in the Ummah.
Were it not for the fact that you think of them (Abu Bakr and 'Umar)
privately as these men said publicly, they would not have dared to
speak like that.' 'Ali (&) said: 'I only think of them in the way I
hope to be. May Allah curse those who think of them in any except
the best of terms.'
"Then he got up with tears running down his cheeks, and he
held my hand until he entered the mosque. He ascended the minbar
and sat on it, holding onto his beard and looking at it - and it was
white -until the people gathered. Tnen he stood up and delivered an
eloquent and moving speech, and he said: 'What is the matter with
people who mention the two leaders of Quraysh and the two leading
figures of the Muslims? I disavow what they say, and I shall punish
them for it. By the One Who causes the seed to split and sprout and
the One Who created the soul, no one loves them (Abu Bakr and

'Umar) but a pious believer, and no one hates them but an immoral
evildoer. They accompanied the Messenger of Allah (s)with
sincerity and loyalty, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is
evil, and they never did anything contrary to what the Messenger of
Allah ( g ) wanted to do. The Messenger of Allah ( g ) never regarded
anyone else's advice as equal to theirs, and he never loved anyone
else as he loved them.
"'When the Messenger of Allah (g)
died, he was pleased with
them; and when they died, the believers were pleased with them. The
Messenger of Allah ordered Abu Bakr (&) to lead the believers in
prayer, and he led them in prayer for nine days277 while the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) was still alive. When Allah took His Prophet
( g ) in death and chose for him that which is with Him, the believers
appointed him (Abu Bakr) in charge of their affairs, and they paid
zakiih to him, because the two go together. Then they gave him their
allegiance willingly and not under compulsion. I was the first one to
do that from among Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, and he was reluctant to
accept it, wishing that someone else could have taken care of that, but
he was the best of those who remained. He was more merciful than
anyone else, more kind, more pious and senior in terms of age and
Islam. He led us as the Messenger of Allah (B)had led us until he
died Wce that, then 'Umar was appointed in charge after him.
"'Some of them were pleased, and some of them were not, but
he ('Umar) did not depart this world until those who had disapproved
of him approved of him. He conducted affairs according to the way of
the Prophet
and his companion (Abu Bakr), following in their
footsteps as the camel calf foUows its mother. He was, by Allah, kind
and compassionate, a merciful helper and supporter of the oppressed,
not fearing the blame of anyone for the sake of Allah (&). Allah
caused his tongue to speak the truth always and made sincerity
second nature to him, until we thought an angel was speaking on his

a)

294

lips. Allah (@) supported Islam by means of his becoming Muslim,
and his migration was a support and help to the faith. Allah
instilled fear of him in the hearts of the hypocrites and instilled love
for him in the hearts of the believers.

(s)

"'Who do yon know who is like them? May Allah have mercy
on them, and may AUah help us to follow their path. No one can
attain what they attained except by following in their footsteps and
loving them. So whoever loves me, let him love them; whoever does
not love them hates me, and I have nothing to do with him. Had I
already explained my position regarding them to you, I would have
given the harshest punishment for this, but I should not punish
anyone before explaining and warning. After today, if anyone is
brought to me who says this, I shall carry out on him the punishment
of the fabricator. Verily the best of this Ummah after its Prophet are
Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and if I wished, I could name the third one. 1

I named him after ' U M ibn 'Affgn"
It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri: "I saw a young,
prepubescent boy with braided hair down to his shoulders, and AUah
knows that I had my doubts about him; I did not know whether
he was a boy or a girl. Then 1passed by one who was even better than
him, who was sitting beside 'Ali (&). I said: 'May AUah bless you,
who is this young man beside you? He said: 'This is 'Uthmin ibn
'Ali. I named him after 'Uthmsn ihn ',
and I named another of
my sons after 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib, another after 'Abbis, the
paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (gJ,
and another after the
best of creation Mu&nnmad. As for al-Hasan, al-Husayn and
~ $ s i n " ~ , they were named by the Messenger of Allah (g),
who

gave its weight in charity, and ordered that they be given their names
and circumcised.281They were born at the time of the Messenger of
Allah (B),and he is the one who named them and offered the
sacrifice on their behalf."'

3.6.4. Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmik
(may Allah be pleased with them)
were held in particular esteem by the Prophet
It is known through mutawstir reports, and it is not hidden
from the common f o k or the elite, that Abu Bakr, 'Umar and
'Uthmk (may Allah be pleased with them) were held in high esteem
by the Prophet
and they were among the most special of people
to him. He was closest to them, and they were closest to him, and he
had ties to all of them through marriage. He loved them and praised
them. There can only be two cases: either they were righteous, both
outwardly and inwardly, during his lifetime and after his death, or
they were the opposite of that during his lifetime or after his death. If
they were not righteous, despite this closeness to the Prophet (@J,
then one of two things must be trne: either he did not know how they
were, or he h e w about it but was turning a blind eye to it. Whatever
the case, this is one of the most serious criticisms against the
Messenger
as the poet said: "If you did not know, that is a
calamity; and if you did know, it is even worse."

(a),

(e),

If they deviated after becoming righteous, then this would
indicate that Allah ( B )had let down His Messenger with regard to
the elite of his Ummah and his senior Companions, and with regard
to the promise that his religion would prevail over all others. How
could the senior members of his inner circle become apostates? This
and similar notions are among the most serious criticisms that the
R51dis make against the Messenger of Allah (g).
As Imam M%k
and others said: These Rifidis only wanted to undermine the

296

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the rime of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

Messenger (g),
so that one might say that he was a man who had had
companions, for if he was a righteous man, then his companions
would have been righteous. Hence the scholars say: "Rifi& ideas
were introduced by heretics."z82

3.6.5. Implications of the Rsidis' regarding
the Companions as disbelievers
The view of the Rififidis, that the Companions were
disbelievers, implies that Amir d-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) was also a
disbeliever, because he failed to cany out the command of Allah
(&). This would imply that the Sharia texts did not reach us through
a proper, mutawitir chain of narration; rather that chain is invalid
because the transmitters were apostates. This in turn leads to criticism
of the noble Qur'an, because it reached us through Abu Bakr,'Umar,
'Uthmh and their brethren. This was the aim of the. one who came up
with this idea. Hence Abu Zar'ah said: If you see a man reviling any
of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (@), then you should
know that he is a heretic, because the Messenger (g)
is true and the
Qnr'an is true. Those who transmitted the Qur'an and Sunnah to us
were the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (@). What these
people want to do is to shed doubt on our witnesses, so as to
undermine the Qnr'an and Sunnah, but they are the ones who deseme
to be criticised, and they are heretics.283Hence the books of the Shia
admit that the one who came up with this idea was lbn Saha'. They
say that he was the first one to openly criticise and disavow Ahu
Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmk and the Companions, and he claimed that 'Ali
(&) told him to do thatZa4

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

297

3.6.6. Real life evidence of the true nature
of the relationship between 'Ali
and the Rightly Guided Caliphs
Actual, practical evidence is established from the biography of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
concerning his relationship with his
brethren Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmk, it is well known and widely
transmitted. In the previous pages, we have quoted a great deal of that
evidence, which proves the sincere love and strong bonds of
brotherhood that existed among these chosen pioneers, the elite of the
generation of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).

(4)

First and foremost is the fact that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) gave his daughter Umm Kulthoom in marriage to Amir alMu'mineen 'Umar (&).285 If 'Umar (&), who was held in high
esteem by the u r n a h - a s al-Farooq (the Criterion), is regarded by the
Shia as a worse disbeliever than lblees himself, shouldn't the Shia
come back to their senses and think about the corrupt nature of their
school of juristic thought and what that implies? Because if Ahu Bakr
and 'Umar (may AUah be pleased with them) were disbelievers, as
they falsely claim, then the fact that 'Ali (&) gave his daughter
Umm Kulthoom al-Kubra in marriage to 'Umar (&) means that 'Ali
became a disbeliever or evildoer who subjected his daughter to
a great sin, because marriage of a a Muslim woman to a disbeliever is
pure fornication.286The wise and fair-minded person with no ulterior
motive, who is sincere in his love for the Prophet (g)
and the
members of his household and their followers, cannot but submit to
the reality of the love and friendship that existed among all four
caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them all). Hence, when it was
said to Mu'izz ad-Dawlah Ahmad ibn Bawayh - a Rzifidi who
reviled the Companions of the Messenger of Allah - that 'Ali (&)
gave his daughter Umm Kulthoom in marriage to 'Umar ibn alKhat&b (&), he was shocked and said: "I did not know that." He

(4)

298

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

repented, gave most of his wealth in charity, freed his slaves, set right
a great deal of his earlier wrongdoing, and worked until he fell
unconscious287 because he realised the enormity of his previous
crimes, in which he had attacked the honour of these pure ones as a
result of being deceived by the false arguments of the ~ Z f i d i s . ~ "
The leaders of the Rsfidi Shia tried to undermine the
significance of this proof by fabricating reports that were falsely
attributed to the Imams, claiming that she "was a woman who
belonged to us and was taken by force."z89Thus they made matters
worse, to such an extent that they depicted Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) as one who could not defend his honour and who approved of
immorality in his family. Is this something that could be imagined
with regard to Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), the hero of Islam?
Even the lowest of the Arabs would offer himself as a sacrifice to
defend his honour and would expose himself to death in order to
defend his womenfolk, so how about Banu Hiishim, who were the
leaders of the Arabs and the noblest of them in lineage and the
highest in terms of chivalry and gallantry? How could they attribute
such abhorrent shortcomings to 'Ali (&) and his daughter, the
granddaughter of the Messenger of Allah (g),
when 'Ali (&) was
so courageous and brave, the lion of Banu GhZb, Asadullah (the
lion of Allah) in the east and west?290
It seems that some of them did not like the implications of this
marriage, so they tried to find a way out of this problem by means of
stranger and weirder logic. They claimed that U r n Kulthoom was
not the daughter of 'Ali(&); rather she was a jinn who took her
shape!291Thus they came up with a notion that is an insult to the
intelligence of men and women of sound reason. Anyone can claim
that the one whom he hates is a male or female jinn; thus people live
with myths and lose sight of the trnth.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

299

Another piece of evidence is the strong blood relationship and
ties of kinship that existed among the Rightly Guided Caliphs, as
well as the expressions of love among them. As we have seen, 'Ali,
al-Hasan and al-Husayn named some of their children after Abu Bakr
and 'Umar. Could anyone name his children after the worst of his
enemies among the disbelievers and those whom he hates the most?
Could he bear to hear the names of his enemies reverberating around
his house throughout the day, time and time again?292
The Companions, the Tgbi'oon who followed them and the
imams of the Muslims did not lean anything from Amir dMu'mineen 'Ali(&,) except love for Abu B&, 'Umar and 'Uthmk
(may Allah be pleased with them) during their lifetimes, dnring their
caliphates and after their deaths. Duing their caliphates, 'Ali(&)
,.
listened to them and obeyed them; be loved them, and they loved
him; he respected them, and they respected him. He was sincere in his
love for and obedience to them. He strove in jihad against those
whom they strove against, loved those that they loved and hated
those that they hated. They used to consult him with regard to new
issues that arose, and he would offer sincere advice on the basis of
compassion and love; many of their decisions were based on his
advice.293These feelings were mutual, and it was said that love of
Abu Bakr, 'Utbmk, 'Umar and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with
them all) could not be combined except in the hearts of the most
pions of this ~ r n r n a hSufyin
. ~ ~ ~ath-Thawri said: "Love for 'Uthmin
and 'Ali cannot be combined except in the hearts of the noblest of
men."295 Anas ibn Milik said: "They said: 'Love for 'Uthmzn and
'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) cannot be combined in the
heart of a believer,' but they lied, for Allah combined love for them
both in our hearts, praise be to Allah."296

3.7. Description of the Companions of
the Prophet (g)
in the Noble Qur'an
Allah

(s)
says:

4Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him
are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You
see them bowing and falling down prostrate [in prayer], seeking
bounty from Allah and [His] good pleasure. The mark of them [i.e. of
their Faith] is on their faces [foreheads] from the traces of prostration
[during prayers]. This is their description in the Tawrgt [Torah]. But
their description in the Injeel [Gospel] is like a [sown] seed which
sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it
stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage
the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them
who believe [i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the
religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resurrection] and do
righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward [i.e.
paradise1.b
(Qur'an 48: 29)
It is appropriate to end this section with this verse, which
serves as evidence for what I have mentioned of love, compassion
and cooperation among the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the noble
Companions (may AUah be pleased with them all). This verse
by praising him,
mentions the status of the Messenger of Allah (g)
then Allah ($$) praises all the Companions (may Allah be pleased
with them all). Allah (g)
mentions their attitude of harshness and
sternness towards the disbelievers, and He also mentions the mutual
compassion and kindness that existed among them. He describes
them as doing many righteous deeds, accompanied by sincerity and
great hope of mercy. Foremost among these righteous deeds is their
offering frequent prayers, seeking the bounty and good pleasure of
Allah (&). In this verse, Allah (g)
also describes the effect of that,

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

301

which is clearly seen on their faces: "The mark of them (i.e. of their
Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration
(during prayers)." It was said that this mark is whiteness on thcir
faces that will be seen on the Day of Resurrection. This is the view of
al-Hasan and Sa'eed ibn Jubayr, and it is one narration from Ibn
'Abhb (&). The other narration from him, which was also narrated
from MU&& is that the mark which can be seen in this world is
dignity. It was also narrated from Mnjaid that it refers to humility
and humbleness.297
There is no contradiction among these opinions because in this
world, dignity may result from humility and modesty, while in the
hereafter, it will be light on their
Ibn Katheer said: "The
intentions of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were
pure, and their deeds were good, so everyone who looked at them
would admire their dignity and their attitude and behaviour." Mzlik
(&) said: "I heard that when the Christians saw the Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them) who conquered Syria, they said:
'By God, these people are better than the Disciples, according to
what we have heard."' And they spoke the truth in that, because this
Ummah is spoken highly of in the earlier Books, and the greatest and
most virtuous of them are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
(g).
Allah (&)referred to mention of them in the previous Books
and reports which were in circulation (before Islam). He said: (This is
their description in the Tawrst Forah]. But their description in the
Injeel [Gospel] is like a [sown] seed which sends forth its shoot, then
makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem,
delighting the s0wers.B (Qur'an 48: 29)
This is exactly how the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
(@) were; they supported him "that He may enrage the disbelievers
with them." According to one report, Imam M2lik (may Allah have
mercy on him) concluded from this verse that the Rzifidis who hate

302

'Ali ibn Abi TLiZib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are disbelievers.
He said: "Because they (the Rz~fidis)are enraged by them (the
Companions), and the one who is enraged by the Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them) is a disbeliever because of this verse." A
number of the scholars agreed with him on that.
The verse continues: BAllah has promised those among them
who believe [i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the
religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resnrrection] and do
righteous good deeds,) (Qur'an 48: 29). This means that He has
promised great reward and good provision, and the promise of Allah
(%) is true; He does not break it. Everyone who follows in the
footsteps of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) is
given the same promise, hut they have an advantage because of their
precedence and the perfection that they obtained. No one else of this
Ummah can catch up with them, may Allah be pleased with them and
make them pleased, and may He make Jannat al-Firdaws their abode,
and that is indeed the case.299
The fact that Allah says about the noble Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them), "that He may enrage the disbelievers
with them" points to the most serious ruling, the sternest threat and
the strongest warning with regard to those who are enraged by the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
or who harbour in their
hearts any grudge against them.3w With regard to the words of Allah,
the Exalted, the Almighty, at the end of the verse, (Allah has
promised those among them who believe [i.e. all those who follow
Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad (g)
till the
Day of Resurrection] and do righteous good deeds,) this is a promise
of paradise from Allah (&) to all the Companions, and also to
everyone who believes and does righteous deeds among the Ummah
of Islam, because this promise is for all the believers until the Day of
~ e s u r r e c t i o nThe
. ~ ~ word

' m i d (translated here as 'among') in this

verse means those who are like them, and does not mean some of
them.
Ibn Taymiyah said: "No doubt this is praise for them for the
attributes mentioned, namely harshness towards the disbelievers,
mercy amongst themselves, bowing and prostrating, seeking the
bounty and pleasure of Allah
the mark of prostration on their
faces and the fact that they started from a position of weakness and
attained perfect strength, like the plants mentioned in the verse. The
promise made to them of forgiveness and great reward is not only for
these characteristics; rather it is for their faith and righteous deeds.
mentions that for which they deserve this promise, even
Allah (g)
though all of them are like that, because if He did not mention that, it
might be thought that they are deserving of forgiveness merely by
virtue of what is mentioned, without explaining the reason why they
deserve this reward."302

(s),

What I have mentioned in this section is in complete
accordance with what the noble Qur'an says about mercy and
compassion among the Companions and harshness against the
disbelievers, especially among the Rightly Guided Caliphs. They are
the noble leaders, the elite of the people and the leaders of the
Ummah after the death of its Prophet. Beware of the weak reports and
fabricated stories that were made up by the enemies of this Ummah in
order to distort the histoly of the early generations of Islam. Should
we believe false reports and worthless stories that depict enmity
among the Rightly Guided Caliphs, or should we believe the Book of
our Lord, what was said concerning them by our Prophet, and what is
in accordance with reports narrated by trustworthy scholars of Ahl
as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah?
Allah (@) says:
(And He has united their [i.e. believers'] hearts. If you had spent all

304

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs

that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah
has united them. Certainly He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.)
(Qur'an 8: 63)
This is the Qur'an's description of the real hannony among the
Companions. This is a great blessing that Allah
bestowed upon
that pure generation, and human beings have nothing to do with it.
The noble Qnr'an states that harmony among the Companions is a
blessing that Allah (&)bestowed upon the Messenger of Allah (g).
This Qur'anic depiction of the reality of the Companions is in
hannony with the sound reports which show love and friendship
among them, thus exposing the deceit of those who fabricated false
reports. The verse also includes everyone who follows the guidance
of the noble Qnr'an and the Sunnah of the leader of the Messengers.
Ibn 'AbbL said: "Ties between relatives may he severed, and a
person's kindness may be rejected and unappreciated, hut there is
nothing like closeness between

(s)

The poet said:

I accompanied people and learned about their nature
and attitude, and I examined the ties connecting them,
and I have realised that blood ties cannot bring together
people who want to sever these ties,
and love and kindness are the strongest of ties.304

and the An& came and swore allegiance to him, and the people did
~ikewise."~
From these sound reports we learn a number of lessons,
including the following:

1.1.1.The support of 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)
for 'UthmSn (&) and his defence of him
This is narrated in mutawiitir reports from 'Ali (&). Indeed,
he defended 'Uthmin (&) most out of all the people. That is
narrated with many chains of narration, and M m i n ibn al-H&am
bore witness to that when he said: "There was no one among the
people who defended our companion more than your companion,"
meaning that 'Ali defended 'Uthmiin?

1.1.2. 'Ali's lack of interest in caliphate
He did not seek or desire the caliphate, and he stayed at home
until the Companions came to him, asking to swear allegiance to him.

1.1.3. The consensus of the Companions, both
Muhgjiroon and An&-, and the people in general
of Madinah, on swearing allegiance to him
Those who swore allegiance to 'Ali (&) included the
decision makers and the prominent people. They are the ones who
went to 'Ali (&) and asked him to accept the oath of allegiance,
insisting until he agreed. It was not the thugs and killers of 'Uthmin
(&), as some we& and fabricated reports suggest.

308

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

1.1.4. 'Ali was the most deserving of the
caliphate among the people at that time
This is indicated by the fact that the Companions went to him
and insisted that he should accept the oath of allegiance, and they
stated clearly that they did not know anyone who was more deserving
of the caliphate at that time than him.

1.1.5. The importance of the caliphate
Hence we see that the Companions hastened to appoint 'Ali

(41who
, used to say: "Were it not for my fear for the religion of
Allah, I would not have agreed."6

1.1.6. The dubious idea that they inserted
concerning the oath of allegiance to 'Ali (&)
This idea suggests that the rebels who besieged 'Uthm2n
(&), some of whom took part in his murder, were in Madinah and
were the first ones to swear allegiance to 'Ali (&), and that Talhah
and az-Zubayr swore allegiance reluctantly, as was narrated by the
historians. This idea has no basis, and the reports concerning it have
no sound chains of narration. The correct view is that the people
could find no one after Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthm%n(may Allah be
pleased with them) who was like the fourth in status, knowledge,
piety, religious commitment, seniority and track record of jihad. The
Muhijiroon and the An& insisted on him, and he thought it was an
obligation upon him, so he agreed to it. If they had not hastened to
swear allegiance to 'Ali (&), that could have led to turmoil and
division throughout the Muslim regions.
It was in the best interests of the Muslims for 'Ali (&,) to
accept the oath of allegiance regardless of the circumstances, and
none of the Companions who were in Madinah held back from

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

309

swearing allegiance to him. Some people confused this with a later
incident when some of the Companions stayed behind instead of
marching to Basra with him. With regard to the oath, no one held
back from that, but with regard to marching to Basra, some stayed
behind because it was a matter of ijtihid? 'Ali (&) did not force
them to come out with him, as we shall see in detail below when we
discuss the Battle of the Camel.

1.1.7. Awareness of the exaggerations of storytellers
We must be aware of the exaggerations of some storytellers
who claim that for five days following the murder of 'Uthmsn (&),
Madinah remained under the control of al-GhZqi ibn Harb while
they looked for someone to accept the position of caliphate and could
not find anyone.' Other reports claimed that the rebels of Egypt made
an offer to 'Ali (&) to become caliph, but he refused; that the rebels
of Kufah offered the caliphate to az-Zubayr, but he did not accept;
and that those who came from Basra offered allegiance to Tamah.
This is not proven in any sound reports, and its chain of narration is
not sound? Moreover, it is well known that the Companions were in
full control of Madinah and would have been able to destroy these
criminals were it not for the request of 'Uthmk (&) to refrain from
using force against them. This is explained in my book Tayseer alKareem al-MannZnj?Seerat 'Uthmrin ibn 'Affin. The correct view is
that allegiance to 'Ali (&) was given voluntarily and freely by the
Muslims, and the troublemakers played no part in that. All of the
Companions in ~ a d i n a h l ' elected Amir al-Mumineen 'Ali

(a).

1.1.8. Sound reports about the
oath of allegiance to 'Ali
There are eleven sound reports about the oath of allegiance to
'Ali (&)." We will discuss some of them in detail below.

310

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

1.2. 'Ali's entitlement to the caliphate
The most deserving of people to be caliph, after Abu Bakr,
'Umar and 'Uthrnin (may Allah be pleased with them), was 'Ali ibn
Abi T&b (&). This is the belief of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-JamS'ah, and
this is what the Muslim is required to believe as part of his faith in
regard to the sequence of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. There is an
indication of 'Ali's being entitled to the caliphate in more than one
Islamic text, including the following:

1. The verse in which Allah says: $Allah has promised those
among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He
will certainly grant them succession to [the present rulers] in the
land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant
them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen
for them [i.e. Islam]. And He will surely, give them in exchange
a safe security after their fear...b (Qur'an 24: 55). The point here
regarding the legitimacy of 'Ali's caliphate is that he was one of
those who were granted succession to (the present rulers) in the
land and to whom was granted the authority to practice their
religion.

2. The words of the Prophet (g):
"I urge you to adhere to my
Sunnah and the way of the Rightly Guided Caliphs who come
after me; hold fast to it and cling to it strongly."12The relevant
point in this hadith with regard to the validity of 'Ali's caliphate
is that he was one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs who enjoined
what is good and forbade what is evil, adhered to the limits set
by AUah ( B ) ,established regular prayer, paid z&& and
followed the way of the Messenger of Allah (&) in justice and
establishing truth.
3.

The words of the Prophet (g)
as narrated in the hadith of
Safeenah: "Caliphate in the footsteps of the Prophet will last for

1

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tklib

31 1

(s)

thirty years, then Allah
will grant power to whomever He
wills."13 This hadith is indicative of the validity of 'Ali's
caliphate, as his caliphate brought to a close the thirty year
period of caliphate in the footsteps of the Prophet (ggthat are
mentioned in this hadith, and this was the basis of the scholars'
opinions.14 A h a d ibn Hanbal said: "The hadith of Safeenah
about the caliphate. is sound, and I based my opinion about the
caliphate on it."15 Abdullah ibn &mad said: "I said to my
father: 'Some people are saying that he ('Ali) was not a caliph.'
He said: 'This is a bad and compt view.' He said: 'The
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
used to address him
as Amir al-Mu'mineen; should we disbelieve them? He led
people on hajj, cut off the hand of the thief and stoned the
adulterer; could the one who did that be anything other than a
caliph?'"'6
Ibn Taymiyah said concerning the hadith of Safeenah: "It is a
well-known hadith that was narrated by Hammiid ibn Salamah,
'Abdul-W&th ibn Sa'eed and al-'Awwh ibn Hawshab from
Sa'eed ibn Jamhh from Safeenah, the freed slave of the
Messenger of Allah (g).
It was narrated by the authors of asSunan such as Abu Diiwood and others, and Imam m a d and
others based their views on it when affnming the caliphate of the
four Rightly Guided Caliphs. A b a d regarded it as sound and
quoted it as evidence against those who were not certain about
the caliphate of 'Ali (&) because the people were divided
concerning him. m a d said: 'Whoever does not regard 'Ali
(&) as the fourth caliph is more misguided than his family's
donkey,' and he forbade accepting such a person's proposal of
~naniage."'~
The commentator of at-Ghhriwiyyah said: "And we affirm 'Ali
as caliph after 'Uthmh (may Allah be pleased with them both).

312

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

When 'Uthmin (&>) was murdered, and the people swore
allegiance to 'Ali (&), he became a true leader to whom
obedience became obligatory. He was the caliph of his time,
following in the footsteps of prophetic leadership, as indicated
by the hadith of Safeenah....'"'
4.

It was narrated that 'Ikrimah said: "Ibn 'Abbh said to me and his
son 'Ali: 'Go to Abu Sa'eed, and listen to him.' So we went and
found him working in a garden. He took his garment and
wrapped it around himself, then he began talking to us until he
mentioned the building of the mosque. He said: 'We were
canying bricks one at a time, and 'Ammk was canying bricks
two at a time. The Prophet (g)
.- started removing dust from him
and saying: "Poor 'Ammzr! He will be killed by a group that is
in the wrong. He will call them to paradise, and they will call
him to hell." 'Ammir said: "I seek refuge with Allah
from
tribulation."'"

''

(s)

According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Sa'eed, he
said to 'Ammir, when be started digging the ditch and he stxted
wiping his head: "~oo?'son of Sumayyah, you will be killed by
a group that is in the wrong."z1 Ihn Taymiyah said, after quoting
the Prophet's words that 'Ammir would be killed by a group that
is in the wrong: "This is indicative of the validity of 'Ali's
leadership and the obligation of obeying him, and that the one
who called people to obey him was calling people to paradise,
and the one who called people to fight him was calling them to
hellfire, regardless of whether his view was based on
misinterpretation or he was a transgressor who had no such
justification. This is the more correct of the two opinions held by
our companions, and it is the view that those who fought 'Ali
were in the wrong. This is the view of the leading jurists,
who derived many rulings from that with regard to fighting

(4)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

313

rebels who have their own justification based on some
misinterpretation.
"When Y a y a ibn Ma'een objected Lo ash-ShZa'i quoting as
evidence events from the life of 'Ali with regard to formulating
rulings on fighting rebels who find justification in some
misinterpretation, he said: 'Is he regarding both Talhah and azZubayr as wrongdoers?' Imam Ahmad responded by saying:
'Woe to you! What else could he do with regard to this issue?' meaning that if he did not derive rulings on the basis of 'Ali's
handling of events that occurred during his caliphate, he would
not have any guidelines from the Rightly Guided Caliphs with
regard to fighting rebels. Neither Ahmad nor any of the Sunni
imams ever hesitated with regard to that."22
If someone were to say that the killing of 'Ammir took place at
%ffeen when he was fighting alongside 'Ali (&), and those
who killed him were with MuZ2wiyah,on whose side there was a
group of the Companions, so how could that hadith refer to them
as people who were calling to hellfire? The answer is that they
thought that they were calling to paradise and they based their
argument on what they thought was correct evidence, so there is
no blame on them for following what they thought was correct.
What is meant by calling to paradise is calling to that which
leads to it, which is obeying the ruler. Thus 'Ammgr was calling
them to obey 'Ali (&), who was the leader to whom obedience
was obligatory at that time, whereas they were calling to
something other than that, because of what appeared to them to
be the right thing to do.23
An-Nawawi said, after quoting the Prophet's words, "Poor son
of Sumayyah, you will he killed by a group that is in the
wrong":z4 "The scholars said: Tnis hadith is clear evidence that
'Mi (&) was in the right, and the other group was in the wrong,

31 4

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

but they thought they were doing the right thing, so there is no
blame on them for that. This is clearly a miracle of the
Messenger of Allah @) for several reasons, including the fact
that it foretold that '&&
would be slain and that Muslims
would kill him and they would be in the wrong, and that the
Companions would fight one another and they would be two
groups, one of which would be transgressing and the other
group. All of that came to pass as clear as day. May Allah send
blessings and peace upon His Messenger, who did not speak on
the basis of whims and desires, rather it was a revelation that was
revealed.""

5.

It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed al-Kkudri said: "The Messenger
of Allah (g)
said: 'A group will secede from my Urnmah at a
time of division among the Muslims, and they will be killed by
the group that is closer to the truth."' It is also narrated that he
said: "There will be among my Ummah two groups, from among
whom (a third) group will secede, and they will be killed by
those who are closer to the truth." According to another version,
he said: "A group will secede at a time of division among'the
people, and they will be killed by the group that is closer to the
truth."Z6 His words "at a time of division" mean when the
people are divided, when there is division among the Muslims.
This is the division that occurred between 'Ali and Mu'swiyah
(may Allah be pleased with them both).27What is meant by the
group that seceded is the people of Nahrawk, they were in
'Ali's camp at the battle of Siffeen, then when 'Ali and
Mu'iiwiyah agreed to arbitration by the two arbitrators, they
seceded. They said: " 'Ali and Mu'iiwiyah are racing towards
disbelief like two horses on which bets are placed, Mu'swiyah
committed an act of disbelief by fighting 'Ali, then 'Ali
committed an act of disbelief by accepting the arbitration of the
two arbitrators." They also regarded Talhah and az-Zubayr as

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

315

disbelievers. They were killed by the group that was with 'Ali
(&). The Prophet ( g ) testified that the group who would fight
them would be closer to the truth, and this is testimony from the
Propbet (g)
that 'Ali and his companions (may Allah be pleased
with them) were in the right. This is one of the miracles of the
Prophet ( g ) because he foretold what was to happen, and events
unfolded as he said. It also offers clear evidence for the validity
of 'AIi's caliphate and the error of those who opposed him."

1.3. The oath of allegiance sworn by Tabah and
az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them)
It was narrated that Abu Basheer al-'Abidi said: "I was in
Madinah when 'Uthmk (&) was killed. The Muhijireen and
Ansir, including T a a h and'&-~ubayr,gathered together and went
to 'Ali (&).
. ., They said: '0 Abu al-Hasan, come and let us swear
allegiance to you.' He said: 'I have no need of that position. I am with
you, and whomever you choose, I will accept him, so choose
someone.' They said: 'By Allah, we will not choose anyone but
you ... ,329 This shows that there was universal allegiance to 'Ali
(&). There are many reports concerning this, some of which were
quoted by Ibn Jareer in his ~areekh.~'
This clearly indicates that the Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) swore allegiance to 'Ali (&), and that they,
including T a a h and azZubayr, were agreed on doing so. As for
what is mentioned in some reports, that Tabah and az-Zubayr swore
allegiance reluctantly, this is not proven in any sound transmission,
and the sound reports state something different.31
At-Tabari narrated that 'Awf ibn Ahi Jameelah said: "As for
me, I bear witness that I heard Muhammad ibn Sireen say: "Ali came
and said to Tabah: "Give me your hand, 0 Tabah, so that I might

i

Ij

31 6

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

give you my allegiance." Talhah said: "You are more desenring, you
are Amir al-Mu'mineen; give me your hand." So 'Ali gave him his
hand, and Talhah swore allegiance to him."'32
It was narrated from 'Abd Khayr al-Khaywihi that he went to
Ahu Moosa and said: "0 Abu Moosa, were these two men meaning Tabah and ai-Zubayr - among those who swore
allegiance to 'Ali (&)?" He said: " ~ e s . " ~ ~

Imam al-M&aqqiq ihn al-'Arahi also stated that the claim that
they swore allegiance reluctantly is false; he said that this was not
something befitting them or 'Ali. He said: "If it is said that they
@&ah and az-Zuhayr) swore allegiance reluctantly, we say: Allah
forbid that they could ever have been reluctant. If they were reluctant,
that could not have affected them because a ruler may become fully
legitimate with the allegiance of one or two people. But this view is
not acceptable, and whoever swore allegiance after that, it was
something that he had to do and was compelled to do so by Shacia.
But if they m a a h and az-Zuhayr) did not swear allegiance, that
would not have affected them, and it would not have affected the
validity of the leader to whom allegiance had already been sworn. As
for the suggestion that he had a paralysed hand, so his oath of
allegiance was not valid,34the one who said that thought that Ta&ah
was the first one to swear allegiance, hut that was not the case. If it
was said that Talhah said: 'I swore allegiance with the sword over my
head,' we would say that this is a fabricated report, for Linguistic
reasons."35 So it is a lie.
As for the idea that someone objected on the grounds that his
hand was paralysed, even if that were so, it is irrelevant, because a
hand that was paralysed as a result of defending the Messenger of
Allah (g)
is a blessed hand.36The reports which say that T a a h and
az-Zubayr were forced to swear allegiance are false.37 As we have
mentioned, there are sound reports indicating that they gave their

M i ibn Abi Tcilib

31 7

allegiance to 'Ali (may Allah he pleased with them all), and there is a
sound report narrated by Ibn ~ a j a rvia
, ~al-Ahnaf
~
ihn Qays, which
says that 'kishah, Talhah and az-Zuhayr (may Allah he pleased with
them) all told &naf that he should give his allegiance to 'Ali (&)
when he asked them to whom allegiance should be given after
'uth(&).39
'Ali's seniority in Islam, virtue, strict adherence to the rulings
of the Qur'an and Sunnah, and promise in his speech to implement
the commands and prohibitions of Sharia left no room for anyone to
object to his right to be the leader of the Muslims. It might be sajd
that 'Ali (&) was the strongest candidate to lead the Ummah after
the murder of 'Umar (&), and 'Umar did in fact appoint him among
the six whom he recommended. However, four members of the
consultative committee - namely ' A h d u r - R b h , Sa'd, Talhah
and azZuhayr - withdrew their names, leaving the choice between
'Ali (&)
, ,
and 'Uthrnin; thus there were only two candidates. This
amounts to consensus on the part of the members of the consultative
committee that if the caliphate had not gone to 'Uthmin, it would
have gone to 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them). After the death
of 'Uthmin (&), when the people of Madinah recommended him
and gave him precedence as the best candidate, he thus became
entitled to the position of caliphate on the basis that none of the
who were present at that
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
time was more qualified than him (&). He was one of the earliest
Muslims and one of the earliest migrants, the cousin and son-in-law
of the Messenger of Allah (g).
Jnaddition to that, he was undeniably
able and qualified. He possessed courage, intelligence and rare
wisdom in judging; he knew how to tackle new situations and crises;
he was firm in adhering to the huth and farsighted in his handling of
affairs. All of these factors made him indisputably the only candidate
to lead the Muslims during that crucial period of their history.40

318

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Despite all that, his caliphate only became valid after there was
consensus among the Muhijireen and Ansir and they swore
allegiance to him.

There is consensus among Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah that
'Ali (&) was entitled to the position of caliphate after 'Uthmin
(&), as the Muhijireen and An& swore allegiance to him, because
of his superiority over the remaining Companions. He was the first of
them to become Muslim, the most knowledgeable, the closest to the
in lineage, the most courageous, the dearest to Allah
Prophet (g)
( B )and His Messenger (g),
the best in calibre, the most superior,
the highest in status and the one who most resembled the Messenger
of Allah (g)
in attitude and character. He was better suited for the
caliphate than anyone else. The Companions of the Prophet (@J who
were left in Madinab swore allegiance to him as caliph unanimously.
At that point, he became a legitimate ruler whom all the people were
obliged to obey, and it was forbidden to rebel against him or oppose
him. Many scholars have narrated that there was consensus on his
caliphate, including the following:

1. Muhammad ibn Sa'd narrated that there was consensus on
swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&) among those Companions in
Madinah who were known for their piety and seniority in Islam.
He said: "Allegiance was sworn to 'Aliibn Abi T Z b (4)
in
Madinah on the day after the killing of 'Uthmin
Allegiance was sworn to him by Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa'd ibn
Abi Waqqik, Sa'eed ibn Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl, 'Ammir ibn
YGir, U s h a h ibn Zayd, Sahl ibn Haneef, Abu Ayyoob a]An~iki,Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Zayd ibn Thibit, Khuzyrnah

Ibn Qudimah (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that Imam
Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated with his chain
of narration from 'Abdur-Razziq from Muhammad ibn Rhhid
that 'Awf said: "I was with d-Hasan and it was as if a man
criticised Abu Moosa for following 'Ali (&). Al-Hasan got
angry, then he said: 'Glory be to Allah! Amir d-Mu'mineen
'Uthmsn was killed, and the people rallied behind the best of
them and swore allegiance to him. Why should Abu Moosa be
blamed for following him?"'42

3.

Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari said: "We a f h e d the validity of
'Ali's leadership after 'Uthmin (&) on the basis of the
allegiance swom by those of the Companions who were people
of prominent position and decision-makers, because none of the
members of the consultative committee was nominated other
than him at that time, and there was consensus on his virtues and
justice. The fact that he refrained from nominating himself for
the caliphate at the time of the caliphs was the right thing to do,
because he knew that his time had not yet come. Then when he
was appointed to the position, he gave it his all and did not fall
short, thus he followed the straight path, as did the caliphs and
leaders of justice before him, following the Book of their Lord
and the Sunnah of their Prophet. These four are the ones on
whom there is consensus with regard to their justice and virtue,
may Allah be pleased with them."43

4.

Abu Na'eem al-Asbahini said: "When there were differences of
opinion among the Companions as to who were the first to
migrate and who were the first to enter Islam and who were the
early supporters who defended the faith, the Ummah is agreed
on their seniority because of their virtue and prominence in

320

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

religious and worldly affairs, and they never disputed
concerning them (the four caliphs) with regard to who was most
entitled to the position of caliphate among the group whom the
Messenger of Allah
testified were people of paradise among
the ten with whom he was pleased when he died. Those who
were left of those ten accepted 'Ali's pre-eminence, and no one
denied that he was one of the most prominent and highest in
status among the Ummah, because of his seniority and his
virtues and knowledge, and because he had been present at
major events. Allah and His Messenger loved him, and he loved
Allah and His Messenger. The believers loved him, and the
hypocrites hated him. His position is not undermined by the fact
that some other Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
were more senior than him; rather that increased his standing
because he recognised the virtue of those to whom he gave
precedence over himself, because that even existed among the
Prophets and Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah he upon
them). Allah says: $Those Messengers! We preferred some of
them to others; ...but Allah does what He likes.) (Qur'an 2: 253)
The fact that some are superior to others did not undermine the
position of those who are of lesser status. All of the Messengers
are chosen by Allah and are the best of His creation. 'Ali (&)
became the leader of the Muslims and ran their state on the basis
of justice and lack of interest in worldly gains, following in his
conduct the way of the Messenger (g)
and of his Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them) until Allah took him as a
martyr, guided and guiding others, leading them on the path of
truth.""

Az-Zuhri said: "He was loyal and sincere to 'Uthrngn (&) until
he was killed, and he was the best of those Companions who
remained. No one was more deserving of the caliphate than him,
but he did not accept it, even though he was the most entitled of
the people to it, until allegiance was sworn to him and the
remaining members of the consultative committee (shoora)
swore allegiance to him along with the rest of the people."46

7. Abdullah alduwayni said: "With regard to 'Umar, 'Uthmin and

'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them), the way to prove that
their caliphates were valid, and that they met the conditions of
being qualified for this post, is the same as that of proving the
validity of the caliphate of Abu Bakr (&). The evidence of
anyone who discusses the position of leadership is to be based
on mutawitir reports and consensus. No attention should be paid
to the one who says that there was no consensus on the caliphate
of 'Ali (&), because his caliphate was not denied; rather there
was division and turmoil because of other issues."47
8.

Abu Abdullah ihn Bat@ said: 'The oath of allegiance to 'Ali
(&) was based on consensus and was a mercy. He did not want
this position, and he did not force them to swear allegiance to
him by the sword; nor did he gain power by means of his clan.
The position of caliphate itself was honoured when 'Ali
became caliph; he adorned it with his high status, gave it a sense
of dignity by means of his justice, and elevated it by his noble
attitude. He refused that position, but they forced him; he was
reluctant, but they put pressure on him."48

(4)

9. Al-Ghazili said: "They all agreed on the superiority of Abu
Bah, then Abu Bakr nominated 'Umar, then they all agreed on
'Uthmib, then on 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all).
These people are not to be thought of with suspicion - as
treacherous with regard to the religion of AUah or as betraying

322

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

the faith for personal gain. Their consensus on that is the best
evidence that highlights the level of their superiority. Hence the
belief of Ah1 as-Sunnah is that their superiority is to be ranked in
this order. Then they looked for reports and found in them the
basis for the views of the Companions and the people of
consensus with regard to this ranking of superiority."49
10. Abu Bakr ibn al-'Arabi said: "When AUah decreed what He
decreed (the murder of 'Uthrnk), it was well known that the
people could not be left without an authority and that the people
after him needed a caliph, so they had to look and see who was
best for that position. There was no one after the first three
caliphs who was like the fourth in status, knowledge, piety and
religious commitment. So allegiance was sworn to him, and
were it not for their haste in swearing allegiance to 'ALi (&,I,
these thugs could have caused further damage that could never
have been repaired. But the Muhgjiroon and the An$& insisted
on him, and he thought it was an obligation upon him, so he
yielded to their pressure and accepted."50

11. Ibn Taymiyah said: "The Companions of the Messenger of Allah
(g)
agreed to swear allegiance to 'Uthm2n after 'Umar, and it is
proven from the Prophet (g)that he said: 'I urge you to adhere
to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after
me; adhere to it and cling firmly to it. And beware of newly
introduced matters, because every innovation is a going
astray."' Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi Taih (&) was the
last of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and a31 of Ah1 as-Sunnah,
scholars, worshippers, commanders and troops were
unanimously agreed that they should say: Ahu Bakr, then
'Umar, then 'Uthmk, then ' ~ l i . " ~ ~

12. Ibn Hajar said: "The swearing of allegiance to 'Ali (&) as
caliph came immediately after the slaying of 'Uthmgn (&),
at

'Aliibn Abi Tcilib

323

the beginning of the month of Dhnl-Hijjab in 35 AH. All of the
Muhgjireen and An& and everyone who was present, swore
allegiance to him. He wrote letters to other provinces telling
them that they should also swear allegiance to him; they all
agreed except Mu'Erwiyah and the people of Syria and there
happened between them what happened."53
What we learn from the above quotations, which describe consensus,
is that the caliphate of 'Ali was the subject of consensus with regard
to its validity at the time it took place. That was after the slaying of
'Uthmh (&),
and there was no one left on earth who was more
,.
entitled to it than 'Ali (&). So the position of caliph finally came to
him at the right time.54
Some pwple have objected to the view that there was
consensus concerning the caliphate of 'Ali (&) for several reasons:
1. The abstention of the Companions Sa'd ibn Ahi Waqqh,
Muhammad ihn Maslamah, Ibn 'Umar, U s h a h ibn Zayd
and others like them.55

2. People only swore allegiance to him on condition that he
execute the killers of 'Uthmh (&).56
3. The people of Syria, MuZ2wiyahand those who were with
him, did not swear allegiance to him, rather they fought
him.57

These objections do not have any effect on the consensus
referred to above, and they do not contradict or undermine it, because
they are to be refuted on several counts:

1. The claim that a number of the Companions abstained from
swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&) is incorrect because no one
refrained from swearing allegiance to him. Some people,
including those mentioned above, did not join him; that was an

324

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

issue that is subject to individual opinion, so each individual
worked it out for himself and acted accordingly.58With regard to
Ibn Khaldoon's comment that the people were scattered
throughout the regions at the time of 'UthmSn's murder and
were not present when the oath of allegiance was sworn to 'Ali
(&), and that of those who were present, some swore allegiance
and some (Sa'd, Sa'eed, Ibn 'Umar and others)59refrained until
the people gathered and agreed on a leader, what is mentioned is
an exaggeration on the part of Ibn Khaldoon (may AUah have
mercy on him). With regard to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqss, his
swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&) was narrated by Ibn Sa'd, Ibn
Wbbih, adh-Dhahabi and others.60The same is tme for the rest;
they swore allegiance, as we have mentioned, and there was
consensus on that among the Companions who were present in
Madinah. Ibn Khaldoon himself has narrated that there was
consensus among the second generation after the Companions in
Madinah that the caliphate of 'Ali (&) became valid and was
binding on all Muslims. I have quoted what Ibn Khaldoon said
because many writers and researchers relied on it later on.

2.

Appointing a caliph and leader is obligatory and essential, but
basing that on the condition that the entire Ummah be present
and agree to it is something impossible. It is not permissible to
stipulate this condition, because that will lead to this duty not
being fulfilled, and many evils may arise as a result.61

3.

Consensus regarding the caliphate of Abu Bakr (&) was
achieved by means of the oaths of allegiance of 'Umar and Abu
'Ubaydah and those of the Ansir who were present with them,
even though 'Ali, 'Uthmih and other Companions were not
present. Similarly, consensus regarding the caliphate of 'Ali
(&) was achieved when Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqz~,Ibn 'Umar,
U s h a h ibn Zayd, 'Ammir and others of those who had been

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

325

present at Badr and other Companions swore allegiance to him,
and that consensus was not undermined by the fact that some
were absent or that some did not swear allegiance (may Allah be
pleased with them all). Al-Hasan al-Basri said: "By Allah, the
oath of allegiance to 'Ali was like the oath of allegiance to Abu
Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them)."62
4.

The claim that allegiance was only sworn to him on the
condition that he would execute the killers of 'Uthmh (&)
could not be a valid condition. Rather they swore allegiance on
the condition that he rule on the basis of justice and truth, which
is by summoning the one who is asking for retaliation and the
one who is accused, then allowing everyone to present his case
and allowing questioning and examination of evidence; only
after that can the verdict be given.63 As for the reports claiming
that Ta&ah, az-Zubayr and some of the other Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them all) stipulated when swearing
allegiance that 'Ali (&) should cany out the hadd punishments,
these reports are weak in their chains of narration, and the texts
are also subject to further d i ~ c u s s i o nConcerning
.~~
that, Ibn al'Arabi said: "If it is said that they swore allegiance to him on the
basis that he would execute the killers of 'Uthmh (&), we say:
That is not valid as a condition of swearing al~egiance."~~

5.

Mu'iwiyah (&) did not fight 'Ali (A)for the position of
caliph, and he never denied the validity of his leadership; rather
he fought him so that the hadd punishments might be camed out
on those who had taken part in the slaying of 'Uthm2n (&),
because in his estimation, that this was the right thing to do. He
was mistaken in that, though, so he would have the reward of
ijtihid only.66 The sound reports prove that his disagreement
with 'Ali (&)
had to do with the execution of the killers of
,.
'Uthmin (&), and he did not dispute with him with regard to

326

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

the caliphate; rather he affirmed his right to that position. It was
narrated from Abu Muslim al-Khawl2ni that he and some other
people came to Mu'iwiyah (&) and said: "You are disputing
with 'Ali ( 4 ) ; are you like him?' He said: "No, by Allah. I
know that he is better than me and has more right to the position
of caliph than me. But don't you know that 'Uthmih (+) was
killed unlawfully, and I am his cousin and am seeking retribution
for his blood? So go and tell him that he should hand over to me
the murderers of 'Uthrnin (&). and I will stop disputing with
him." So they went to 'Ali (&) and spoke to him, but he did not
hand the murderers over to him.67
Ibn Katheer narrated via Ibn Deezeel, with his chak of
narration going back to Abu ad-Dard? and Abu U m h a h (may
Allah be pleased with them both), that they entered upon Mu'iwiyah
and said to him: "0 Mn'Ziwiyah, why are you fighting this man? For
by Allah, he has more seniority in Islam than you and your father, he
was closer to the Messenger of AUah (g)than you and he is more
deserving of this position than you." He said: "I am fighting him
because of the issue of seeking retribution for the blood of 'Uthmin
(&), and he has given refuge to his killers. So go to him and tell
him: Let him exact retribution on the murderers of 'Uthmin (&),
then I will be the first of the people of Syria to swear allegiance to
him."68
The reports concerning this matter are many, and they are well
known to the scholars.69They indicate that MuC2wiyah(&) was not
disputing with 'Ali ( 4 ) for the caliphate, and this was stated by the
scholars who examined this issue and established this fact7' Imam
al-Haramayn al-Juwayni said: "Even though Mu'Ziwiyah fought 'Ali,
he did not deny the validity of his caliphate, and he never wanted it
for himself; rather he was pursuing the killers of 'Uthmin (&)
because he thought that he was correct, but he was wrong."71 Ibn

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

327

Hajar al-Haythami said: "Among the beliefs of Ah1 as-Suunah walJami'ah is that what happened between 'Ali and Mu'2wiyah (may
Allah be pleased with them both) of fighting was not because
Mu'iwiyah was competing with 'Ali (&) for the caliphate, because
there was consensus that 'Ali (&) was more qualified for it, as we
have seen. So the turmoil was not because of that; rather it is because
Mu'iwiyah (&), and those who were with him, asked 'Ali
to
hand over the killers of 'Uthmik (&) to them because Mu'iwiyah
was 'Uthmin's cousin, but 'Ali (&) refn~ed."'~We will explain
'Ali's stance and why he did not hand over the killers of 'Uthm2n
(&,) later on, but the point here is to prove that Mu'iwiyah's not
swearing allegiance did not mean that he objected to 'Ali becoming
the caliph.

(4)

Ibn Taymiyah said: "Mu'iwiyah did not seek the caliphate,
and no one swore allegiance to him as caliph when he fought 'Ali
(&). He was not fighting on the basis that he should be caliph or that
he was entitled to the caliphate. All the scholars affirm that, and
Mu'iwiyah confirmed that to those who asked him about it. In
addition to that, the supporters of both groups73 affirmed that
Mu'iwiyah was not equal to 'Ali (&)with regard to the position of
caliph, and he could not be caliph while it was possible to appoint
'Ali (&) to that position. 'Ali's superiority, seniority, knowledge,
religious commitment, courage and all of his virmes were obvious
and well known to them."74 Thus it is proven that no one was
competing with 'Ali (&) for the caliphate, either among those who
differed with him or any others.75 These scholarly opinions all have
to do with the belief of Ah1 as-Sunuah wal-Jami'ah with regard to the
order of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, so it is essential to defend this
belief, tell people about it, raise the new generation with it and be
proud of it.

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

1.5. Conditions stipulated by Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) in the oath of allegiance,
and the first speech that he delivered
Some reports state that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
stipulated a number of conditions with regard to the oath'-of
allegiance to him, including: that allegiance should be sworn in
pubLic and not in secret, that it should be done in the mosque, that it
should be done with the approval of the Muslims, and that he would
run their affairs as he saw fit and on the basis of what he knew. They
agreed and arranged to meet in the mosque the following morning to
swear the oath of allegiance.76 That was an eventful and important
day. Amir al-Mu'mineen came out wearing complete formal
clothing. After praising and glorifying Allah (g),
he explained to the
people the attempts that had been made to convince him to accept the
caliphate, and he said: "I was reluctant to be appointed in charge of
your affairs, but you insisted that I should he in charge of you. I have
no authority without your support, and indeed the keys of your
wealth are with me. Verily I have no right to keep even a single
dirham to myself in exclusion of
Then he said: "0 people,
this issue of leadership is your affair, and no one has any right to it
except the one whom you appoint. Yesterday we parted after
agreeing on a matter, so if you want, I will sit to receive your oath of
allegiance; otherwise, I do not have any hard feelings towards anyone
(if you change your minds)." Then be raised his voice and said: "Do
you agree?" They said: "Yes." He said: "0 Allah, bear witness over
them," and the people started to give their oath of allegiance to
him.78 After the oath of allegiance had been sworn, Amir alMu'mineen said: "0people, you have sworn allegiance to me on the
same basis as you swore allegiance to my companions. As you have
sworn allegiance to me, you have no other option than to follow me,
and the ruler is obliged to follow the right path and to be upright and
just. This is a general oath of allegiance..."79

'Ali ibn Abi Ta'lib

329

Among the lessons we learn from this are the following:

1.5.1. The principle of consultation
The swearing of allegiance to the fourth caliph 'Ali (&) was
no different, with regard to the principle of consultation, from those
that came before it, despite the crisis that the Ummah was going
through and the turmoil and problems that were coming one after
another. Allegiance was not sworn on the basis of clan, family or
tribe, or on the basis of instructions or a covenant from the Messenger
of Allah (g).
If there was anything of that nature, there could not
have been that lengthy a discussion, and Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
would not have refused; he would have been the first one to
demand his rights. On the contrary, the people were pushing and
urging him to accept the oath of allegiance, and he was trying to
avoid them and keep out of it, hoping that something would happen
to prevent him from getting involved, until he accepted it reluctantly.
If there were any instrnctions from the Messenger of Allah (&) to
that effect, they would not have hesitated to cany them out, but they
did not ask him to do that on the basis of instructions. Nor did they
ask him on the grounds that he was from the tribe of 'Abd Man% or
because he was one of Quraysh; rather it was because he was one of
the earliest to become Muslim, he was one of the ten who were given
the glad tidings of paradise, and he was the people's second choice
after 'UthnCin (&) when the consultation process was canied out
after the murder of 'Umar ibn al-KhatGb
Whenever 'AbdurR a m & ibn 'Awf consulted someone &d they recommended
appointing 'Uthmin as the caliph after 'Umar, he asked the pelson
whom be would choose if 'Uthmzn were not there, and the answer
every time was 'Ali

(4)

(A).

330

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way oflife

1.5.2. The decision-makers and prominent people
at the time of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
When Abu Bah, 'Umar and 'Uth&n (may Allah be pleased
with them) were appointed as caliphs, the decision-makers and
prominent people comprised the remainder of the ten who had been
given the glad tidings of paradise, as well as the clan chiefs of al-Aws
and al-Khazraj. They were all residents of Madinah, among the first
to become Muslim, and well-versed in knowledge and faith."
'Ali (&) thought that the selection of the caliph was a matter
for those who were still in Madinah of the Muhijireen and An&, the
decision-makers among those who had been present at Badr and the
consultative committee, but al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&) thought that
attention should be paid to the new elements in Muslim society. That
is clarified in the discussion that took place between al-Hasan ibn
'Ali and his father 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (may Allah be pleased with
them both). Al-Hasan said: "I told you, but you did not listen to me,
and next you will he killed when you are alone with no one to suppoa
yon." 'Ali (&,) said: "You are still nagging like a little girl. What is
it that you told me to do and I did not listento you?" He said: "I told
you on the day that 'Uthmh (&) was besieged to leave Madinah, so
that if he was killed you would not be there. Then I told you on the
day that he was killed not to accept the oath of allegiance until the
delegations from different regions and Arab tribes had each sworn
their allegiance."82 'Ali's response was: "As for your telling me not
to accept the oath of allegiance until the allegiance of the regions
came, this matter is something to he decided by the people of
Madinah, and we did not want this decision to be made by others."83
'Ali (&) thought that swearing allegiance to appoint the
caliph could be done by people other than the people of Madinah and
the MuhSjiroon and Ans%, hut he did not want this position to be
moved away from them to others or that others should participate in it

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

331

at that time. He was concerned that a person from elsewhere might
introduce new things that drifted away from the ways of the
Messenger of Allah (&) and the earlier caliphs, or that it was still too
early to allow anyone other than the Muhzjiroon and An$% to
participate in the selection of the Muslim ruler. Therefore he did not
want this issue to be taken away from the MuhSjiroon and ~ n $ & . ~ ~
The evidence for that is that when the people of Kufah suggested to
him that allegiance should be given to al-Hasan, he said: "I neither
forbid you nor enjoin you." This indicates that it is permissible for
people other than the people of Madinah to choose the ruler.
From this discussion that took place between al-Hasan ibn 'Ali
and his father (may Allah be pleased with them both), we learn a
number of things:
(a) Respect for the other side's opinion in discussions.
(b) Kind and gentle treatment of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn
Abi T2ib (&) towards his son.
(c) Franhess of the son towards his father in expressing
everything he thought was right in this discussion.
(d) Listening properly to the other side, as Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%ib (&) listened to all the
arguments presented by his son al-Hasan.
(e) Discussing the points one after another in a systematic
manner.85

1.5.3. Keenness that the position of caliph

should not remain vacant
The MuhSjiroon and An$% in Madinah insisted that 'Ali (&)
should accept the position of caliph, even though be was reluctant, so
as to ward off the danger of the Ummah falling into chaos and

332

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

division. So he accepted and was keen to push the rebels a step
backwards by stipulating that allegiance should be swom to him
openly in the mosque. The people of prominent position and the
decision-makers are the ones who should appoint the caliph; as for
the common folk, their place is in swearing the general oath of
allegiance, which is to he done openly.86He was keen to confirm this
principle from the minbar when he said: "0 people, this matter of
yours (appointing someone to the caliphate) is your affair, and no one
has the right to take that position except the one whom yon
appoint."87

1.5.4. Response to some contemporary writers
who talk about the oath of allegiance to 'Ali (&)
AlL'Aqqiid says, speaking about the election of the caliph after
the murder of 'Uthmin (&): "This report, even though it is brief,
listed for us the names of the possible candidates for the caliphate
in Madinah after the killing of 'Uthmiin
Perhaps those who
sought it most were Talhah and az-Zubayr, who declared war on 'Mi
(&) later on. They were paving the way for that during 'Uthmin's
Lifetime; they thought that Quraysh had already decided that no
Hishimi should take that position, and that 'Ali (&) would soon be
pushed away from the post of caliph after 'Uthm2n (&), as he had
been before. 'A'ishah (&) preferred for the caliphate to end up with
one of these two or wi& Abdullah ibn ai-Znbayr, because Talhah
was from the tribe of Taym, and az-Zubayr was the husband of her
sister Asma'. The support of 'A'ishah for one of them would give
great hope of success."s8

2

(4).

Elsewhere, he said: "The matter concerning which there is no
doubt is that Imam ['AliI)>&(
was annoyed at the injustice done to
him when allegiance was sworn to someone else after the death of his
cousin (B),
and he thought that his kinship with the Prophet was an

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

333

advantage that would make him more qualified to become caliph
after him, because it was a branch of prophethood as he thought.
They were the family of prophethood, and the message descended
among them, as he said."89
He also said: "It is well known that 'Ali (&) thought that he
was more entitled to the caliphate than his predecessors, hut he had
been pushed away from his right since the departnre of the Prophet
(B)to the higher companion."90 There are other serious mistakes,
lies and obvious fabrications in which al-'Aqqzd indulged because of
the fahricated reports.
Similar errors were made by Khilid Muhammad Khilid in his
hook Khulafa' ar-Rasool, in which he quoted from 'Ali (&)
fahricated words, according to which he said that Abu Bakr and
'Umar had usurped the caliphate from
Khilid al-Beetir was
also mistaken in his book 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib when he commented on
the stance of Fitimah (@)
with regard to the inheritance of her
.i
fathepz and the attitude of 'Ali (&)
. ., concerning the caliphate of Abu
Bakr (&).
These are just a few examples from a long list of people who
discussed these issues and said things that were not based on proper
research and knowledge, claiming that 'Ali was pushed away from
the caliphate after the death of 'Uthmin (&) as he had been pushed
away before that; that the Companions were conspiring to seize the
caliphate on the basis of tribal affiliation and resentment against
Banu Hishim, or for the purpose of worldly gains; that 'Ali was upset
because of the unfairness that befell him when allegiance was given
to someone other than him after the death of the Prophet (g);
that he
felt that he was more entitled to the caliphate than his predecessors,
and that the Prophet (g)
had paved the way for his caliphate and
tried to make him loved by the people when he appointed him as a
commander on some occasions and left him in charge of Madinah in

334

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflqe

his absence on others; that there were no close relationships between
'Ali (+) and the other Companions; that he forgave Abn Bakr and
'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) for their transgression
against him and seizure of the caliphate; and that he swore allegiance
to Abn Bakr only after the death of Fitimah (%+).

AU of these are lies and fabrications that are contrary to truth,
justice and fairness; they are also contrary to the sound historical
record and to clear statements made by 'Ali (&) himself, as quoted
above. He acknowledged the superiority of-the previous caliphs
when he was caliph; he would even announce that from the minbar
and issue threats of punishment to anyone who gave him precedence
over them. This is proven with sound chains of narration. He was a
support and help to them, and his relationships with them were
strong. The strength of these bonds was not affected by the turmoil
and troubles that were stirred up by those whose confusion was based
on weak and fabricated reports from the authors whom we have
mentioned, whose statements we have quoted by way of example;
this is not a complete list. The reason why they fell into this pit was
their ignorance of the methodology of Ah1 asSunnah wal-Jami'ah in
writing history, as well as the fact that they were not able to
distinguish between sound sources and worthless sources, or between
sound reports and weak or fabricated reports, so they relied on
fabricated reports when reaching their conclusions.

1.5.5. The first speech delivered by 'Ali (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said, in the first speech that he
delivered when he was appointed as caliph: "Allah, may He he
glorified and exalted, sent down a Book of guidance in which He
explained good and evil, so do what is good and stay away from what
is evil. Cany out obligatory duties for the sake of Allah, and Allah
will lead yon to paradise. Allah has established sacred limits that are

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

335

not unknown; He has made the sanctity of the Muslim more sacred
than all other sacred limits; and He has brought the Muslims together
on the basis of devotion and tawheed. The Muslim is the one from
whose hand and tongue the Muslims are safe, except when there is a
legitimate reason. It is not permissible to harm a Muslim except when
there is a legitimate reason. Pay attention to the interests of the
people...for the people are in front of you (meaning that you could do
something for them), and the Hour is behind you and will catch up
with you. Show littleinterest in this world, and you will join the
righteous people, because what lies ahead of the people is their
destination in the hereafter. Fear Allah with regard to His slaves and
His land, for you are responsible even for the land and the animals.
Obey Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and do not disobey
Him. If you see something good, then go ahead and do it; if you see
something evil, then leave it. jAnd remember when you were few
and were reckoned weak in the land) (Qur'an 8: 26)."93

(4)

Since the oath of allegiance to 'Ali
came after
overwhelming turmoil, the victim of which was the previous caliph
of the Muslims, he called the Muslims to do good and to stay away
from evil, and he explained to them that the sanctity of the Muslim
surpassed all others, and that it is not permissible to harm a Muslim
under any circumstances. Then he reminded them of death and the
hereafter, and he urged them to adhere to piety, obedience and
righteous deeds.94
The main points of this speech had to do with aspects of belief,
worship and attitude. He also referred to some of the aims of Sharia.
We may sum up the plan that he wanted to draw up for the people as
follows: Go back to the way you were at the time of the Messenger of
Allah (B)~'
and the Rightly Guided Caliphs who came before 'Ali
(4).
With wisdom and eloquence, Amir al-Mu'mineen explained
the foundation for the new era of the caliphate by saying: "If you see

336

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

something good, then go ahead and do it; if you see something evil,
then leave it."
He concluded wlth the Qur'anic verse that they needed to he
reminded of, so as to compare how they were before Islam and after.
They had been few in number, weak, lonely and in a state of
obscurity, to the extent that they were like a piece of meat pecked by
birds, but now [after Islam came] they had gained in strength,
abundance, security, peace, prosperity and riches. Allah (&) had
granted them blessings, so they had become famous; their banners
were planted throughout the world, and people and countries had
submitted to them.96

1.5.6. The equivalence of the words 'imam',
'caliph' and 'Amir al-Mu'mineen'
An-Nawawi said: "It is permissible to call the ruler caliph,
imam and Amir al-~u'mineen."" Ihn Khaldoon said: "We have
explained the definition of this position: it is someone who acts on
behalf of the one who brought Sharia with regard to protecting the
religion and taking care of the worldly affairs of the Muslims. That
post may be called the caliphate or imamate, and the one who fills
that post may be called the caliph or imam."98Ihn Mandhoor
- defines
the caliphate as ~ l e r s h i Abn
~ . ~Zahrah
~
explained the similarity
between these two words caliphate and greater imamate: "It is called
caliphate (khilafah) because the one who takes that post and becomes
the ultimate ruler of the Muslims is taking the position of succeeding
the Prophet (g)
with regard to running their affairs; and it is called
the imamate because the caliph was called imam, because obedience
to him is obligatory, and the people rally behind him as they would
rally behind the one who led them in prayer."100 Professor
Muhammad al-Muhkak explained the reason for the choice of these
words - imam, caliph and Amir al-Mu'mineen - as aimed at

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

337

making the Islamic concept of the state distinct from the ancient
system of monarchy as understood by other nations such as the
Persians and the Byzantines, since those systems were fundamentally
different from the new Islamic concept.101 The early caliphs were
called both caliphs and imams, and from the time of 'Umar ibn alK h a g b (&), the Muslims began to use the title Amir alMu'mineen.
The word imam is mentioned in the noble Qur'an in more than
one place in the sense of leader, guide or head. Allah (s)
says: lfHe
[Allah] said [to him], 'Verily, I am going to make you an Imam [a
leader] for mankind [to follow you].' [ I b a e e m (Abraham)] said,
'And of my offspring [to make leaders].' [Allah] said, 'My Covenant
[prophethood] includes not Zrilimoon [polytheists and wrongdoers')
(Qur'an 2: 124). This means that He was going to make him an
example to be followed.102He (&) also says: Band make us leaders
(Qur'an 25: 74), so that they
[imaman] of the Muttaqoon [the
will follow us in matters of religion. He says: B[And remember] the
Day when We shall call together all human beings with their
[respective] Imam [their Prophets, or their records of good and bad
deeds, or their holy Books l i e the Qur'an, the Taw& (Torah), the
Injeel (Gospel), or the leaders whom the people followed in this
world]), (Qur'an 17: 71), that is, with whomever they followed as a
leader, he it a Prophet or a religious leader, or as it was said: the book
of their deeds which they sent ahead.'03 The word imam also appears
in many places in the Sunnah, such as the words of the Messenger of
Allah (g):
"Whoever swears allegiance to amler [imam], giving him
his hand with sincerity, let him obey him if he can. If another comes
and disputes with him, then strike the neck of the other one;"lo4

[imam]...,,106

The oath of ullegiunce to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

It may be noted that the word imamate is most often used by
Ah1 as-Sunuah in their books of 'aqeedah (belief) and fiqh, while the
word caliphate is more usually used in their historical books. The
reason for that may be that these books, especially those on 'aqeedah,
were written to refute those who introduced innovations into these
matters, such as the R Z d i Shia and the Kharijites.'" The Rifi* Shia
use the word imam but not the word caliph, and they regard it as one
of their pillars of faith and they differentiate between imamate and
caliphate. They regard the imamate as religious leadership and the
caliphate as head of state,''' intending thereby to affirm that 'Ali was
the imam during the time of the three caliphs who preceded him.'09
Ibn Khaldoon said: 'The Shia gave the title of imam exclusively to
'Ali so as to affirm his position of imamate which was akin to the
position of caliphate, and to affirm what they believe: that he had
more right to lead the people in prayer than Abu Ba!a (&)."'"
These titles - caliph, imam and Amir al-Mu'mineen - are
not an issue that has to do with religious beliefs and actions, rather
they are terminologies that existed after the death of the Messenger
(g)that were used by the people. The Muslims also used other titles
later on, such as amir (emir), as was the case in Andalusia, and sultan,
and rulers may be called by any of these titles in the Islamic state.
What matters in this regard is that the Muslims and their leaders
should submit to Islamic teachings in beliefs and in laws and
legislation, regardless of the titles that may be given to the head of
state -whether his title is caliph, Amir al-Mu'mineen, head of state
or president of the republic. Any of these titles or others may be used,
depending on the people's customs. It is preferable to use the titles
mentioned above, though, because they have political connotations
that are distinct from the connotations used by other nations, and
because they have meanings that resonate throughout o w history as a
symbol of Islamic civilisation."'

1.5.7. Which is more correct when mentioning
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
- to say
'May Allah be pleased with him', 'May Allah
honour his face', or 'Peace be upon him'?
The basic principle when mentioning the Companions is to say
'may Allah be pleased with them all', as Allah (&) says: $And the
foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhijiroon and the An& and also
those who followed them exactly [in Faith]. Allah is well-pleased
with them as they are well-pleased with Him@(Qur'an 9: 100) and
(Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave the
Bay 'ah [pledge] to you [O Muhammad] under the tree.) (Qur'an 48:
18). Hence Ah1 as-Sunnah are accustomed to saying 'may Allah be
pleased with him' for any Companion who is mentioned or from
whom any hadith is narrated. For example, it may be said: "This
hadith was narrated from Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with
him)."
As far as I know, they do not use the phrase 'peace be upon
him' when mentioning any of the Companions, even though peace or
salzm is the greeting of the Muslims amongst themselves, as Allah
(&) says: $But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a
greeting from Allah [i.e. say: as-Sakimu 'Alaykum - peace he on
you], blessed and good) (Qur'an 24: 61). Based on this, saying 'may
Allah be pleased with him' is better than saying 'peace be upon him'.
Allah (&) says: (But the greatest bliss is the Good Pleasure of Allah)
(Qur'an 9: 72),and the Prophet (g)
told us that Allah (&)says to the
people of paradise: "I grant you My pleasure, and I will never be
angry with you again.""' But the scholars are accustomed to saying
'peace be upon him' only with regard to the prophets, because Allah
(&) says: 4And peace be on the Messengers) (Qur'an 37: 181) and
(And Salzm beace] be on him the day he was born) (Qur'an 19: 15).

340

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflife

Due to the report that was narrated concerning 'Ali (&), in
which the Prophet (g)
said to him: "You are to me as Haroon was to
~ o o s a , " "those
~
who exaggerate, such as the Rifias, started to use
the phrases 'peace be upon him' or 'may Allah honour his face' with
regard to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&>I. Undoubtedly he is
deserving of that, but the other Companions are just as worthy."4
This phrase was used by many copyists and scribes, and by some of
the scholars of Ah1 as-Sunnah, specifically with regard to 'Ali (4);
they would say 'peace he upon him' or 'may Allah honour his face'
when referring to him hut not to the rest of the Companions. Even
though the meaning may be correct, we should treat all the
Companions equally in that regard.'15

2. Some of the virtues and most
important characteristics of 'Ali (&)
and the basis for his system of rule
Imam m a d , Ism2eel al-Q2@, an-Nas2'i and Ahu 'Ali anNeesahoori said: "There are no reports (with good chains of
narration) concerning any of the Companions more numerous than
those which were narrated concerning 'Ali (&)." ' I 6 Al-Hi%& ihn
Hajar said: "The reason for that is that he came at a later stage, i.e., he
was the last of the Rightly Guided Caliphs; differences arose during
his time, and there were some groups who rebelled against him. That
was why the Companions explained his virtues so often to people, in
order to refute those who opposed him. Therefore Ah1 as-Sunnah
needed to propagate his virtues, and there were many narrators
thereof. However, each of the four caliphs had a great deal of good
virtues, and if you compare the virtues of the four on the basis of
fairness and justice, the conclusion you reach will never differ from
the view of Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jams'ah at all."117 Ihn Katheer said:

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

341

"Among the virtues of 'Ali (&>) is that he was the closest in lineage
to the Messenger of Allah (g)
of the ten whom our Prophet testified
would be in paradise.""8 I have mentioned a great deal about his
virtues above, as appropriate. In order to complete the picture of the
virtues of 'Ali (&),
we may add the following:

4- It was narrated that Zurr (4)
said that 'Ali (&>) said: "By
the One Who caused the seed to split and sprout and
created the soul, the unlettered Prophet (g)
told me that
no one loves me but a believer, and no one hates me but a
hypocrite."119

when I was listening: 'Was 'Ali present at Badr?' He said:

Allah be pleased with them), and the rock moved. The
Messenger of Allah (g)

paradise, az-Zubayr will be in paradise, 'Abdur-Ramin

A man came to Ibn 'Umar and asked him about 'Uthm2n
(&). He mentioned his good deeds and said: "Perhaps
that bothers you?" He said: "Yes." He said: "May Allah
cause your nose to he rubbed in the dust!" Then he asked
him about 'Ali (&), and he mentioned his good deeds and
said: "It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the
houses of the Prophet (B)."Then he said: "Perhaps that
annoys you?" He said: "Indeed it does." He said: "May
Allah cause your nose to be rubbed in the dust! Go away
and do whatever you can against me."lZ4

As for the attributes of 'Ali (&), he had the attributes of a
devoted leader who is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of
Allah and His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet (g).
We will sum
them up in a few lines here, then we will focus on some of them in
more detail. Some of the most important of these attributes were:
soundness of belief, knowledge of Sharia, trust in Allah, leading by
example, sincerity, calibre, courage, chivalry, asceticism, love of
sacrifice, choosing helpers well, humility, forbearance, patience,
ambition, determination, strong willpower, justice and the ability to
teach and train leaders. There are other qualities that may show
themselves to the researcher who studies the Makkan period, during
the Madinan period, when he
which he was with the Prophet
accompanied the Messenger of Allah (g)
on his military campaigns;
and his role in the society. There were still other attributes that were
manifested when he was appointed leader of the state and became
Amir al-Mu'mineen (&). Among the most important of these
qualities were the following:

(s);

2.1. Knowledge and understanding of Islam
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was one of the senior scholars
among the Companions. He was distinguished by his abundant

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

343

knowledge and eagerness to acquire further knowledge. He used all
means and methods available at that time to acquire and preserve
knowledge, such as writing, studying and staying close to the Prophet
(g).
With regard to his collecting the noble Qur'an, he said: "I swore
an oath that I would not wear my cloak except in prayer until I had
~ ~also said: ''I did not sleep at the time of
collected the ~ n r ' a n . " ' He
the Messenger of Allah (g)
until I found out what Jibreel (as) had
brought down that day of hala and h a r k , or Sunnah, or Qur'an, or
instructions or prohibitions, and concerning whom it had come
down."1z6 'Ali (&) would hear the text directly from the Messenger
of Allah (&),but if he heard a haAith from someone else, he would
be very cautious about accepting it, lest he attribute to the Messenger
of AUah (g)
something that he did not say. Among the indications
that he used this method are his words: "If I heard a hadith from the
Messenger of Allah (g),
I would benefit from it as much Allah (&)
willed, and if someone else told me a hadith from the Messenger of
I would ask him to swear to it, and if he swore to it I
Allah
would believe him."

(s,)),

He said: "Abn Balcr told me - and Ahu Bakr spoke the truth
(&) - I l~eardthe Messenger of Allah say: 'There is no slave who
commits a sin then purifies himself properly, then stands up and
prays two raka'ahs and asks Allah for forgiveness, but AUah will
forgive him."' Then he recited this verse: (And those who, when
they have committed Fcihishah [illegal sexual intercourse] or
wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness
for their sins; and none can forgive sins but Allah - and do not
persist in what [wrong] they have done, while they know) (Qur'an 3:
135)."~ Yes, 'Ali ihn Abi Taib (&) asked the Companions of the
Messenger of AUah (g)
to swear, even though they were trustworthy
and of good character. This is indicative of his extreme caution in
accepting hadiths that he received from anyone other than the
Messenger of Allah (@)."'

344

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

'Ali (&) was a man who used to ask a lot of questions and
had the ability to understand quickly. He said: "My Lord gave me a
smart mind and a questioning tongue."'29 He attributed his great
knowledge to his seeking it from the Messenger of Allah (B)by
asking questions. He said: "If I asked, I would be given an answer,
and if I remained quiet, I would still be taught."'30 When shyness
came between him and the Messenger of Allah (g)
and prevented
him from asking questions, he would ask one of the Companions to
ask for him. It was narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah
reported that 'Ali said: "I was a man who had a great deal of preseminal fluid, and I felt too shy to ask Messenger of AUah (&) about
that, so I asked d - M i q d g ihn d-Aswad to ask him for me, and he
said: 'Wudoo' is required for that.'"13' 'Ali (&) wamed the people
against failing to acquire knowledge because of shyness, saying:
"None of you should feel too shy to learn if he does not know,'32 and
an ignorant person should not feel too shy to ask about what he does
not know."
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was among the few Muslims
who knew how to read and write in the early days of Islam. Over and
above that, he was one of the scribes who wrote down the revelation
for the Messenger of AUah (g).
This skill in reading and writing also
helped him to develop a deep knowledge of Islam. He thought that
texts should be written in a clear script, with distinct gaps between
the lines and the letters close together. It was narrated from Ahu
'UthmZn 'Amr ibn Bahr ihn al-Jiihiz that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ibn Ahi Taih (&) said: "Handwriting has a message, so the clearer
it is, the better."133 He instructed his scribe 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi
R2fi': "Fill your inkpot, and sharpen your pen so that it will last
longer. Leave gaps between the lines, and bring the letters close
together."134 It was narrated that Ahu Hakeemah al-'Abdi said: "We
used to write out the mu~hafsin Kufab. 'Ali would pass by us while

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

345

we were writing, and he would say: 'Make your writing big and
clear.' I cut my pen, then I wrote, and he said: 'This is the way; give
light to that to which Allah has granted light.""35

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) also put into practice what he
learned. He was one of the most eager of people to apply what he
heard from the Messenger of Allah (g)
even in the most difficult
circumstances, as we saw when the Messenger of Allah (gjtaught
the remembrances to F i ~ a and
h him (may Allah be pleased with
them both). He said: "I never stopped doing that since the time I
heard it from the Prophet (g)."
He was asked: "Not even on the
night of Siffeen?" He said: "Not even on the night of ~ i f f e e n . " ' ~ ~
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) used to preserve the text by
putting it into action, as he said: "Acquire knowledge, and you will
become known for it; act upon it, and you will become people of
knowledge."137 He thought that a scholar could not be called a
scholar unless he acted upon his knowledge; hence he said to the
bearers of knowledge: "0 bearers of knowledge, act upon it, for the
true bearer of knowledge is the one who acts upon what be learns and
whose actions are in accordance with his k n ~ w l e d g e . " ' ~He
~ also
said: "Knowledge calls out to action to join it. If action responds (all
well and good); otherwise, knowledge will
'Ali (&) issued many fatwas compared to other Companions
of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn alQayyim said: "Those among the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah from whom fatwas were taken were 130-odd, both men and
women. Those who issued a large number of fatwas were seven:
'Umar ibn al-Khat(?ib, 'Ali ibn Abi T%b, Abdullah ibn Mas'ood,
' ~ i s h a hMother of the Believers, Zayd ibn Thibit, Abdullah ibn
'Abbis and Abdullah ibn 'Umar."'40 Ibn Hazm regarded 'Ali (&)
as the third among the Companions (may AUah be pleased with them
all) with regard to the number of fatwas he issued. In our discussion

of the judiciary institutions, we will examine in greater detail his
interpretations of Islamic law and other judiciary matters.
'Ali (&) used to urge people to visit one another and discuss
issues of knowledge, saying: "Visit one anothir and discuss hadiths;
do not neglect it lest they di~appear."'~'According to another report:
"Visit one another and discuss hadiths, for if you do not do that, they
encouraged
will disappear."14z Amir d-Mu'mineen 'ALi (&)

staying close to a religious scholar and being keen to learn from him.
He said: "Do not feel that you have had enough of staying with him
for a long time, for he is like a palm tree; you never know when
something will fall from it on
'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&) had the opportunity to stay with the
Messenger of Allah (@).as a small child, as he was raised under his
care, and as an adult, when he became his son-in-law and the father of
his two grandsons; thus he was close to the Messenger of Allah and
learned from him. 'pishah (&jtestified to 'Ali's close
companionship with the ~ e s s e n g e r o fAllah (@J. It was narrated
from a l - M i q d h ihn Shurayh that his father said: '7 asked 'pishah:

who asked him about wiping over the khuffs (leather socks).' She
said: 'Go to 'Ali and ask him, for he stayed close to the Prophet (g).'
I went to 'Ali and asked him, and he said: 'The Messenger of Allah
(g)
instructed us to wipe over the khuffs when we travelled."""
'Ali (&) thought that one should be selective in choosing
what to learn.' He said: "Knowledge is more than can be learned, so
take from each branch of knowledge what is best."'45 He reached
such a high level of knowledge that he used to tell the people in Traq:
"Ask me." It was narrated that Sa'eed ihn d-Musayyah (&) said:
"None of the people said 'Ask me' except 'Ali ihn Ahi Tilib
The people, both Companions and Tzbi'oon, had great
confidence in his knowledge. It was narrated that Ibn 'Abhzs (&)

'Ali ibn Abi Talib

347

said: "If a sound report came to us from 'Ali, we would not regard
anything else as equal to that report."147 It was also narrated that Ibn
'Abbis said: "If a trustworthy person narrated a fatwa to us from 'Ali
(&), we would be content with it (and would not ask anyone
else)."'48 It was narrated from Suwayd ibn Ghaflah that a man came
to him asking about the inheritance of a man who had died, leaving
behind his daughter and his wife. Suwayd said: "I will tell you of the
verdict of 'Ali (&)." The man said: "The verdict of 'Ali (&) is
sufficient for me." He said: "He allocated one-eighth to his wife and
one-half to his daughter, then be gave the rest to his daughter."'49
The people praised 'Ali (&) for his knowledge. It was
narrated that 'kishah (may AUah be pleased with her) said: "He is
the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah among the people."1s0
Mu'%wiyah( 4 ) used to write to someone to ask 'Ali ibn Abi T%b
( 4 ) on his behalf about new issues that he faced. When news of
'Ali's murder reached him, Mu'$wiyah said: "Islamic jurisprudence
and knowledge have been lost with the death of 'Ali ibn Abi T a b
(.*7)."151
w
It was narrated from al-Hasan ibn 'Ali that he addressed
the people after the death of 'Ali (&) and said: "A man left you
yesterday who was never surpassed in knowledge by those who came
before him and will never be surpassed by those who come after
him,"lSZ It was also narrated that Abdnllah ibn 'Ayyzsh ibn Abi
Rabee'ah said, when asked about 'Ali (&):
. . "He was a prominent
person who stood for the sake of Allah (&), he was related to the
Messenger of AUah (B)
through ties of blood and marriage, and he
was one of the earliest to come to Islam. He had unsurpassed
knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah. He was a great warrior and the
most generous at the time of need."153It was narrated that Masrooq
said: "The most prominent in knowledge of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah were 'Umar, 'Ali, Ibn Mas'ood and Abdullah
(may Allah be pleased with them all)."154

348

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) left behind advice and guidance
to seekers of knowledge, scholars and jurists. This advice, which
deserves to be memorised and acted upon, includes the following.

2.1.1. People are of three types: the devoted scholar,
the one who seeks knowledge in order to save
himself and the riffraff who follow every caller
Al-H=dh
- Abu Na'eem narrated that Kameet ihn Ziyid said:
'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&,) took me by the hand and led me out to the
desert. When we got there, he sat down, breathing deeply, then he
said: '0 Kameel ibn Ziyid, hearts are like vessels; the best of them
are those that contain the most knowledge. Remember what I say to
you. People are of three types: the devoted scholar, the one who seeks
knowledge in order to save himself and the riffraff who follow every
caller, bending with every wind; they do not seek guidance with
knowledge and they never hold on to any strong pillar.""55 This
eloquent advice included the most beautiful exhortation and wisdom.
Amir al-Mu'mineen divided people into three categories:
"

(a) The devoted scholars. What is meant here is religious
scholars, learned people of religion who practice what they
know and also preach to others, combining understanding
of religion with wisdom, as Ibn 'Abbis (&) said in his
commentary on the verse (Be you Rabb6niyyoon [learned
men of religion who practise what they know and also
preach to others]) (Qur'an 3: 79). He said: "People of
wisdom and deep understanding." This report was
narrated by Imam Bukhari. This is also how Abdullah ibn
Mas'ood (&) interpreted it.'56 Those who combine
wisdom and understanding of religion are the ones who
are qualified to teach and guide the Ummah, because
wisdom means putting things in the right place, which

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

349

I

I
I

includes properly implementing the mlings of Sharia on
people's reality. That requires precise and subtle
understanding of the realities of Muslim society. Another
aspect of wisdom is teaching this Ummah about its
religion, which requires a combination of teaching the
religion and training the Muslims to he conscious of Allah
and to observe good manners. As for deep understanding,
that means understanding religious rulings from their
Sharia sources. Hence the devoted scholars are the best of
the Ummah, because they combine two virtues, namely
the acquisition of knowledge and teaching and training
others. Hence they are the ones who are qualified to teach
and lead the ~ m m a h . " ~
Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&)
defined the devoted scholars as being the ones who teach
the people wisdom and train them on that basis."8

(b) Seekers of knowledge, whose intention is sincere, so that it
might be a means of their being absolved of responsibility
before Allah
'Ali (&) referred to this type of person
when he said: "The one who seeks knowledge in order to
save himself." This applies not only to seekers of
knowledge who devote their lives to the pursuit thereof,
hut also to eveqone who shoulders the responsibility of
applying this religion to life. These are the people who are
concerned with their salvation in the hereafter, so they ask
the devoted scholars questions about religious matters in
order to worship AlJah
with proper understanding and
to interact with people according to the guidelines set by
Allah
Such people are regarded as those who seek
knowledge in order to save themselves, even if they do not
sit in study circles.'59 Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ah (A&)
showed us the importance of sincerity of intention towards

(s).

(a)

(s).

350

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

Allah when seeking knowledge. He called on the people to
give precedence to that which is with Allah (&) and the
hereafter over insignificant worldly gains and whims and
desires, to give precedence to calling people to the Book of
M a h and the Snnnah of His Messenger and the religion of
truth, and to be patient in doing so.
(c) Those who neglect to seek religious knowledge and who
have no connection with the devoted scholars when it
comes to leaming about their religion. Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) described them as "the riffraff who follow every
caller, bending with every wind and not seeking guidance
with knowledge." He warned against this class of people,
who have no character. He advised the people to focus on
the truth and adhere to it, to spend their time in this world
and in the hereafter in obedience to Allah (B),
to seek to
be guided by the light of Allah (&) and to make this world
a step towards the hereafter.

2.1.2. Contrast between knowledge and wealth
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi (&) also advised Kameel ibn Ziy2d
that knowledge is better than wealth. This is because knowledge will
protect you, whereas you have to protect wealth; knowledge
increases with action, whereas wealth decreases with spending;
knowledge is a judge or criterion, whereas wealth is subject to mles;
the benefit of wealth disappears when wealth is lost, whereas loving
the scholars is a sign of religious commitment. Knowledge brings
authority to a scholar, and he will have a good name even after he
dies, whereas those who accumulate wealth are dead even while they
are alive. The names of the scholars will be remembered until the end
of time, and although their physical being may be gone, their
teachings remain in people's hearts.16' Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali

Xli ibn Abi T&lib

351

(&) drew acontrast between knowledge and wealth on the basis that

Islamic knowledge is the most important thing for those who focus
on the hereafter; for them, it is the ultimate ambition and honour in
this world and in the hereafter. What is meant by wealth here is that
which a person accumulates because of his love for it, which he does
not use in ways that are pleasing to Allah and in accordance with the
laws of his Lord. 'Ali
justified his view on the following bases:

(4)

(a) Knowledge protects a person, whereas the one who owns wealth
is the one who has to protect it. The way in which knowledge
protects a person is that religious knowledge protects him from
the things that lead to doom in this world and in the hereafter.
With regard to the hereafter, the meaning is obvious and well
known, as this knowledge leads a person to the pleasure of AUah
(&) and to paradise, and it helps him to avoid the path that leads
to hell. What a great achievement for a person to seek, and what
great gains there may be. As for protection from that which leads
to doom in this world, it is true spiritual happiness that cannot be
achieved except by means of certain faith, before which the
entire world and its troubles become insignificant. All of the
grief and calamities become coolness and peace for those who
have certain faith, because they ignore it and pay no heed, while
these misfortunes and disasters turn life into hell for those who
regard this life as their capital and profit. With regard to the
meaning of the owner of wealth protecting his wealth, that is
quite obvious. How much are the wealthy controlled by worries
and fears for their wealth, to the extent that they become sick and
they continue to guard their wealth with wony, anxiety and
exhausting grief?161 Knowledge gives insight and enables one to
choose what is best, to draw lessons from the nations of the past
and to live in accordance with these lessons. Knowledge
broadens the horizons and enables one to understand differences
of opinions and determine which are acceptable; it helps one to

352

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

understand the pros and cons and goals, and it teaches one how
to prioritise and know what one is doing.
@) Knowledge grows and becomes more deeply rooted when one

acts upon it, because the application of knowledge makes it more
deeply entrenched in the mind. This is unlike wealth, which
decreases as it is spent. What is referred to here is the wealth of
people whose aim is this world, who spend that wealth only for
the sake of worldly pleasure. As for the wealth of people whose
aim is the hereafter, it is subjected to Sharia rulings, so spending
from it increases it. The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "A
person's wealth does not decrease because of charity."16'
(c) Sharia knowledge is that which leads and judges. It is the true
ruler because a person organises his affairs by means of it, and
all systems that rule people's lives should be based on it. As for
wealth, it is subject to rule, because earning and spending it is
subject to rules and regulations, whether they are the rules and
regulations of Sharia or otherwise.163
(d) Social relationships that are based on common financial interest
fade away as soon as the wealth disappears. It is wealth that
foms the basis of those relationships, and they are founded on
mutual interests that last only as long as the wealth is present. So
when the wealth disappears, those mutual interests go away, too.
As for the brotherly relationships that are based on the exchange
of religious knowledge between the scholars and those that love
knowledge, they will abide forever in this world and in the
hereafter. Allah (&) says: @%ends on that Day will be foes one
to another except al-Muttaqoon [the pions]fi (Qur'an 43: 67).
(e) Islamic knowledge brings to those who have it the love and
obedience of the Muslims, which they give willingly without it
being imposed on them. This respect continues throughout their
lives; their memory is cherished after their death and will

continue to be so until Allah (&)inherits the earth and eveTone
on it, because the people have not lost anything but their images
and figures.
If we examine history until the present day, we will find that the
names of the scholars from the time of the Companions (may Allah
be pleased with them) reverberate throughout histoly. History has
recorded their lives in books, speeches and lessons, whereas the
names of those who were great in worldly terms are often forgotten
when their lives come to an end, and sometimes their names are
already forgotten even while they are still alive.'64

2.1.3. The one who has proper understanding

(of Islam) is the one who does not cause people
to despair of the mercy of Allah (&)
"The one who has proper understanding (of Islam) is the one
who does not cause people to despair of the mercy of Allah and does
not cause them to feel safe from the punishment of Allah
he
does not give them concessions to disobey Allah (@) and does not
give precedence to any book over the Qur'an. There is nothing good
in worship that is not based on knowledge, there is nothing good in
knowledge that is not based on proper understanding, and there is
nothing good in reading in which there is no pause for thought."

(s);

In these words, Am3 al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) explains that
part of proper understanding of religion is adhering to a balanced and
moderate approach when discussing worldly affairs and trying to
reform the people's situation. This means that the one who calls
people to Islam should tread a middle path between fear and hope. He
or she should not cause people to be so afraid that they despair of the
mercy of AUah
but he or she should not raise their hopes to the
extent that they feel safe fromthe punishment of Allah (@). Here we
find 'Ali (&) stating that it is a sign of proper understanding of the

(s),

354

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflife

religion that the scholar does not give the impression that sin is not
very serious, as this might lead people to become audacious. He
should preserve the level of faith and piety that people already have,
while at the same time trying to raise them towards perfection.
Another aspect of proper understanding of Islam is trying to
strengthen the connection between the Muslims and the Book of
AUah. Thus 'Ali explains the importance of the noble Qur'zn, giving
it absolute precedence and ultimate priority above all other things.
This is an explanation of the way in which we should deal with the
Qur'an; we should not give precedence to any other book out of lack
of interest in it, because it is the primary source of guidance. It is well
known tbat the Sunnah of the Prophet is a detailed explanation of the
noble Qur'an, so telling people to consult the Qur'an is like telling
them to consult the Sunnah. Then he explains that one of the most
important conditions of Islamically acceptable worship is that it
should stem from knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah, and that
knowledge cannot be beneficial unless it is accompanied by sound
understanding.
He concludes his beneficial advice by explaining the
importance of pondering the meanings of the Book of Allah while
reading it, because all goodness is in understanding the aims of the
Qur'an in order to act upon its rulings and to focus completely on
Allah (&) with one's heart, mind, soul and physical faculties when
reading His Book. We should do all tbat we can in order to
understand what Allah ( B )meant and to follow His commands,
heed His prohibitions and rid ourselves of all obstacles that come
between us and the Book of Allah. We should be completely devoted
and sincere to Allah (s).
We should try to seek the message of Allah
and His Messenger (g)
and the religion of truth, even if that leads to
losing our family, wealth, children and worldly possessions, because
that which is with Allah (&) is better and more lasting. We should

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

355

heed this exhortation and strengthen our faith by pondering over this
great Book.'65

2.1.4. How soothing it is to the heart
It was narrated from ash-Sha'bi that 'Ali (&) went out to
them saying: "How soothing it is to the heart." It was said to him:
"What is that?" He said: "To say, when you do not know something:
Allah (&) knows best."'66

2.1.5. People of knowledge and their duty
to teach the people
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Allah did not take
covenants from ignorant people that they should learn until He took
covenants from people of knowledge that they should teach."'67

2.1.6. Goodness is in abundant knowledge,
not in wealth or children
'Ali (&) said: "Goodness does not mean increasing your
wealth and number of children, rather goodness means increasing
your knowledge, having great patience and deliberation, and
competing with people in worship of your Lord. If you do well, then
praise Allah (&), and if you do badly, then seek forgiveness from
Allah (&). There is nothing good in this world except one of two
men: a man who commits a sin and then hastens to erase it by
repenting, and a man who strives to do good. No deed is insignificant
if it is accompanied by piety; how can it be insignificant if it is
ac~epted?"'~~

2.1.7. Knowledge and ignorance
'Ali (&) said: "It is sufficient honour for knowledge that the
one who is not good at it claims it and is happy if it is attributed to

356

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflife

him. And it is sufficient humiliation for ignorance that the one who is
ignorant disavows it and becomes angry if it is attributed to him."'69

2.1.8. The reason why people have little
interest in seeking knowledge
'Ali (&) said: "The reason why people have little interest in
seeking knowledge is that they see that the one who has knowledge
benefits little from the knowledge that he has."17' This is a warning
to bad scholars who put people off from following the path of Allah
(&). It is a call to the scholars to act upon their knowledge, to call
people to it and to be patient in putting up with their annoyance for
the sake of Allah (&).

2.1.9. Rights of the scholars over the Ummah
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Among the rights of the
scholar is that you should not ask too many questions of him, you
should be content with his answer, you should not annoy him when
he gets tired, you should not grab his garment if he wants to leave,
you should not disclose his secret, you should not backbite anyone in
his presence, you should not seek out his faults, and if he makes a
mistake you should accept his explanation. You should respect him
for the sake of Allah (&$) as long as he is obeying the commands of
Allah. You should not sit in front of him, and if he needs something,
you should be the first to serve him."'"

2.1.10. The status of the active scholars before Allah
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Whoever learns and acts
upon his knowledge will be called a great man in the kingdom of
heaven."i72 This is a call to learn, and it is encouragement to strive
for the high position with which Allah
honours the one who
leams and acts upon what he learns, seeking His pleasure.

2.1.11. Focusing on knowledge is better
than focusing on voluntary worship
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&>) said: "The scholar is superior to
the one who fasts and prays at night and strives in jihad. When the
scholar dies, a gap appears in the fortress of Islam unless another
scholar takes his place."'73 This advice is indicative of 'Ali's deep
understanding of priorities, because he thought that effort that goes
beyond oneself to benefit other people, which is knowledge, should
take precedence over efforts in worship, which only benefit the
individual himself.
This is some of the good advice given by Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) to the seekers of knowledge.

2.2. The asceticism and piety of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
From living the noble Qur'an, staying close to the Prophet (g)
and keeping company with the noble Companions, and from the way
he viewed this life, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&)
understood that this world is the realm of trials and tests. Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) was raised with the Book of Allah, and he
understood the verses that speak of this world and tell us that it is
insignificant and temporary in nature and that it will qnickly come to
an end, as well as the verses that encourage people to focus on the
hereafter and that tell of its honour and eternal reward, such as the
verse in which Allah (&) says:
4And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is
like the water [rain] which We send down from the sky, and the
vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green.
But [later] it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter.
And Allah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the

358

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that
last, are better with your Lord for rewards and better in respect of
(Qur'an 18: 46)
hope.)
He was raised by the Prophet (g),
who was the most
knowledgeable of all mankind about this world and its value; he is
the one who said: "If this world were worth a gnat's wing before
Allah (B),He would not give the disbeliever a drink of
He also said: "This world in comparison to the hereafter is like one of
you dipping one finger into the sea; let him see how much it can
hold175 and "This world is like a prison for the believer and a
paradise for the di~believer."'~~
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
,.
was
influenced by this Qur'anic and prophetic upbringing. He became
one of the best examples of how the Prophet (B)taught, purified and
disciplined his followers, of which Allah (&) said:
(Similarly [to complete My Blessings on you], We have sent among
you a Messenger ~ u h a m m a d ]of your own, reciting to you Our
Verses [the Qur'an] and purifying you ...%
(Qur'an 2: 151)

'Ali gave us brilLiant parables of asceticism, of which a few
examples follow:

2.2.1. "0 yellow, 0 white, tempt someone
other than me"
It was narrated from 'Ali ibn Rabee'ah al-Wzbili that Ibn anNabbQ came to 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) and said: "0 Amir alMu'mineen, the public treasury of the Muslims is filled with yellow
and white (referring to gold and silver)." He said: "Allcihu akbar!"
Then he stood up, leaning on Ibn an-Nabb*, and went to the public
treasluy of the Muslims, where he said:
"0Ibn an-Nabb&, bring me the people of Kufah." So the call went
out to the people, and 'Ali (&) gave away everything that was in the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

359

treasury of the Muslims, saying all the while: "0 yellow, 0 white,
tempt someone other than me. Take, take!" until there was neither
dinar nor &ham left in it. Then he issued instructions that it should
be sprinkled with water, and he prayed two raka'ahs therein.
According to another report narrated by Abu Na'eem, Majma' atTaymi said: "Ali used to sweep the public treasury and pray in it. He
took it as a place of prayer in the hope that it would testify for him on
the Day of Resurrection."
This is an eloquent example of putting oneself above the
fleeting luxuries of this world. The Muslims' treasury was filled with
gold and silver, hut Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did not look at it
with admiration and pride; rather his response, when the official told
him about that, was to say, ''AllBhu akbar!" Although some people
venerate worldly accumulation and think of wealth as being great,
Allah (&) is greater than that and greater than all things. As long as
the Muslim truly feels that Allah is greater, why should he make his
heart submit to anything less? This shows deep understanding on the
part of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), as he remembered the
insignificance of this world and magnified AUah (by saying "All&hu
akbar"). This is an implicit rebuke to the one who is deceived by
temporary worldly accumulation and forgets that Allah is greater
than all things. This is indeed a very accurate evaluation that is felt by
the believer who is enlightened by Allah. The more he recognizes in
his heart that Allah (&) is greater than all things, the more these
worldly matters and everything that has to do with them will become
insignificant, and he will begin to use hal5.l wealth to obey AUah
(g).
On the other hand, if worldly gain becomes more significant in
his heart, it will be at the expense of his regarding Allah ( B )as great.
We see Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) soaring to heights of
greabess when addressing worldly gains by saying: "0 yellow, 0
white, tempt someone other than me." This is indicative of a lively

360

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

conscience and sensitive feelings that regard this world as an enemy
that is trying to cheat and deceive its opponent. Thus he announced
his victory over all the inclinations of self-interest and emotions. He
showed that he was using reason to make a proper evaluation of
worldly accumulation, because all times of pleasure or of hardship
are aansient, and to make a proper evaluation of the hereafter,
because it is eternal and has both great blessings and the terror of its
punishment in hellfire. He (&>) reached the pinnacle when he prayed
two raka'ahs in the public treasury so that they would be witnesses
for him on the Day of Resurrection, testifying that he was just in his
ruling and that he adhered to the straight path. Perhaps his taking the
treasury as a place of prayer symbolised the superiority of the
hereafter over this world and the perfect, sublime conduct he
followed when disposing of this wealth in legitimate ways.177

2.2.2. "By Allah, I do not take anything
from your wealth"
Another example of 'Ali's asceticism was narrated by Haroon
ibn 'Antarah from his father, who said: "1 entered upon 'Ali ibn Abi
T%b in Khoornaq (a place in Kufah) and found him shivering
beneath an old, worn out cloak. I said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, Allah
has allocated to you and your family a share of this wealth, and you
are doing this to yourself!' He said: 'By Allah, I do not take anything
from your wealth; rather this is my old cloak that I came out with
from my house' - or he said: 'from adi in ah.""^^
We may wonder: what made Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
live the life of the poor and put up with the hitter cold when he was
able to buy the best and warmest of clothes on earth? This is an
example of true asceticism, as he shunned worldly conveniences
even though he was able to afford them. He was a student of the
prophetic school in which he was raised, with no interest in the

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

361

fleeting conveniences of this world; instead, he had a spirit of
competing for the eternal blessings of the hereafter. The Messenger
of Allah (&) lived the life of the poor, even though he could have
been like the best of the rich."9

2.2.3. "I am happy with what he sold me,
and he was happy with what he took"
It was narrated that Abn Matar ibn Abdullah al-Juhani said: "I
saw 'Ali wearing a lower garment and upper garment and cawing a
stick, as if he were a Bedouin of the desert." Then he mentioned him
entering the marketplace and bargaining with one of the merchants
over a garment for three dirhams. The merchant recognised
whereupon 'Ali (&) decided not to buy anything from him. He went
to another merchant, and when that one recognised him too, he did
not buy anything from him either. Then he went to a young lad and
brought a shirt from him for three dirhams. The boy's father came,
and the boy told him what had happened. His father took one dirham,
went to 'Ali (&) and said: "This dirham, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen!"
'Mi (&) said: "What about this dirham?' He said: "The price of the
shirt was two dirhams." He said: "I am happy with what he sold me,
and he was happy with what he took."'80 This is an example of the
asceticism of Mi al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi mih (&). His
outward appearance gave the impression that he was a Bedouin man
because his clothing was scnrffy; when he bought clothes for himself,
he chose the humble kind that were cheap in price, even though at
that time he was the highest official in the world, as he was the caliph
of the Muslims. This is indicative of his humility and lack of interest
in worldly goods, even though he had his share of the fay', the
treasury and other sources of state income that were available to those
like him who worked full-time taking care of the Muslims' interests.

362

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

Another example of his piety and cautious approach, which
was aimed at being above suspicion lest he fall into sin, is reflected in
his refusal to buy from those who recognised him. They might have
given him a lower price because of his staus, and he did not want to
take advantage of this high position for personal gain. This shows a
precise understanding of the concepts of piety and awareness of
Allah (&), because the position of caliphate for him and others like
him was a righteous deed. The caliph, if he is just, is the first of the
seven whom AUah
will shade with His shade on the Day of
Resurrection. He did not want to sully this righteous deed with
worldly interests, thus changing the good deeds into a cause of
punishment instead of reward. This sublime conduct set a good
example for those who came after hirn.18'

(a)

2.2.4. "It is more humbling to the heart,
and an example for the believer to follow"
'Umar ibn Qays said: It was said to 'Ali (&): "Why do you
patch your shirt?" He said: "It is more humbling to the heart, and an
example for the believer to f ~ l l o w . ' ' ' ~This
~ is an example of his
asceticism and his eagerness to train the Muslims to live a life of selfdenial and simplicity. He noted two things about wearing patched
clothes. Fist, it is a means of &g
the heart and soul humble and
keeping away fromthe causes of self admiration and pride. Secondly,
he regarded that as an example to the Muslims. If the people saw him
wearing patched clothes when he w z occupying the highest position,
their hearts would become humble, and they would avoid competing
with each other to buy expensive clothes. This would also lend
support to and raise the morale of the ascetics whom people always
criticise for their simple way of lifcLa3

2.2.5."Nothing of the wealth of Allah ( B )is
permissible for the caliph except two plates"
It was narrated that Abdullah ibn Zurayr al-Ghifiqi said: "I
entered upon 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&), and he offered us some pieces
of meat cooked in water and sprinkled with flour. I said: 'May Allah
(
.J9

) you; why didn't you offer us some of this duck, for AUah
(g)
has blessed us a great deal?' He said: '0 son of Zurayr, I heard
the Messenger of Allah (,#)
- > say: "Nothing of the wealth of Allah
(i)
is permissible for the caliph except two plates, a plate from
which he and his family eat and a plate which he offers to
Here we see Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib
(&) setting a sublime example of piety and asceticism with regard
to worldly luxuries of food and drink.He could have taken whatever
he wanted from the treasuly, without anyone noticing, in order to live
at the same level as the richest of the Muslims. But he was content
with a hard l i e , preferring the hereafter to this world, preferring to be
on the safe side with regard to his religious commitment. He sought
to set a good example, because if the highest man in the state lived
like this, then that would be a consolation to the poor, encouraging
them to be patient and accept the decree of Allah (g).
Conversely, it
would be an exhortation to the rich to be grateful to Allah (&)and to
reduce their indulgence in extravagance and luxury.'85

2.2.6. "I do not like anything to enter
my stomach except that which I know"
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)used to put a seal on the sack of
barley flour that he ate from, &d he would say: ''I do not like
anytbmg to enter my stomach except that which I know."lS6 Sufyh
said: "Ali did not build one brick over a brick or one stone over a
stone (meaning that he did not build a lofty house for himself). His
grain was brought to him from Madinah in a sack."'87

364

2.2.7. "You have a nice smell,
a nice colour, and a nice taste"
'Adiyy ibn Thsbit and Habbah ibn Juwayn narrated that a
large platter of sweets called faloodhaj
was brought to 'Ali (&),
but he did not eat. 'Ali (&) said: "You have a nice smell, a nice
colour and a nice taste, but I do not want to get accustomed to
something that I am not accustomed to."la9

2.2.8. The least interested of all people in
worldly adornment was 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&)
Al-Hasan ibn S%ih ibn Hayy said: "They were discussing
ascetics in the presence of 'Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez, and he said:
'The least interested of aJ1 people in worldly adornment was 'Ali ibn
Abi T51ib.'"i90 Al-Dhahabi stated that 'Ali (&) rode a donkey with
his feet dangling to one side, and he said: "I am the one who looked
down on the temptation of this world." Tbis action was by way of
setting a practical example of asceticism and piety and looking down
on worldly adornment, not by way of showing off.19'
Concerning wealth, Abu 'Ubayd narrated from 'Ali (&) that
he gave out money to people three times in one year, then some
wealth came to him from Isfahan, and he said: "0people, come to a
fourth distribution, for I am not your storekeeper." Some people took
it, and some people refused it.'' 'Ali (&) addressed the people and
said: "0 people, by Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, I
have never touched your wealth, a little or a lot, except this," and he
took out from the sleeve of his garment a bottle in which there was
perfume. He said: "Some chieftain gave this to me as a gift." Then he
went to the treasluy and said: "Take!" And he composed the
following line of verse: "He will prosper who has a small reed
container from which he eats a date every day."'93

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

365

Asceticism was one of the most prominent characteristics in
the personality of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib (&>). He
lived simply, despite the availability of luxuries and wealth, and
despite the people's trust in him and their respect for him, which
prevented any criticism, checking or blame.'94 Despite his
asceticism, piety and strict adherence to his religion, he was not
harsh, sombre, stem-faced, gloomy or miserable. In fact, he was
friendly and cheerful, with a noticeable sense of humour. It was
narrated that he had a handsome and cheerful face and stepped lightly
upon the earth.195'Ali
described asceticism by saying: "0
people, asceticism means not expecting to live a long life, being
grateful for blessings and refraining from h a r h things."'96
Expecting to live a long life makes one forget the hereafter. Not
expecting to live a long life enables one to combine the interests of
both this world and the hereafter, seeking the pleasure of Allah (s).

(4)

Being grateful for blessings is an attribute of the devoted
Muslims who are aware of the blessings that Allah (g)
has bestowed
upon them, whether tangible or intangible, apparent or hidden. They
respond with gratitude to the Almighty, the Giver. 'Ali's definition of
the real nature of asceticism undoubtedly shows that the asceticism of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib (&) had an impact on those
around him, and that he was an effective teacher in the history of the
Ummah. Ahu al-fIasan an-Nadwi made a connection between
asceticism and revival in Muslim society, saying: 'We have seen that
asceticism and revival go hand-in-hand in Islamic history. We do not
know of anyone who turned things around and altered the course of
history, breathing new l i e into Muslim society or opening a new era
into Islamic history, leaving behind any eternal legacy of knowledge,
thought and religious commitment that remained influential for
centuries after, dominating the fields of knowledge and literature,
except that he had an inclination towards asceticism, had complete
mastery over his physical desires and had control over materialistic

366

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

gains and materialistic people. The reason for this is that asceticism
gives a man power to resist and gives him self-confidence on the
basis of belief, and it makes him look down on materialistic men,
those who are victims of physical desires and prisoners of their
stomachs." 197

2.3. The humility of Amir al-Mu'mineen

'Ali ibn Abi Tslib (&)
One of the Qur'anic attitudes that were embodied in the
character of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T%h (&) was that of
humility. Allah (%) says:
4And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you
can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature
(Qur'an 17: 37)
like the mountains in height.)
(And tum not your face away from men with pride, nor walk in
insolence through the earth. Verily, Allah likes not any arrogant
boaster. 'And be moderate [or show no insolence] in your walking,
and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the braying
(Qur'an 31: 18-19)
of the asses.)
In the verse from Soorat al-Isra', there is a clear call to adopt
the best of characteristics, such as humility and gentleness, and to
know one's limitations. There is a clear prohibition of evil
inclinations such as pride, arrogance, exultation in riches and looking
down on people. The command to adopt the opposite attributes of
humility and moderation is understood implicitly from the
prohibition mentioned above. Allah concluded this prohibition and
command by stating His displeasure and anger with the one who has
these negative qualities. Allab ($1 says: @erily, AUah likes not any
arrogant boaster) (Qur'an 31: 18). The fact that He does not love the
one who is like that means that He is angry and displeased with him,

'Ali ibn Abi riilib

367

as is indicated by the verse quoted above, and that is enough
encouragement to make the believer love humility.198 In order to
promote humility, the noble Qur'an does not stop there; it encourages
it in the most eloquent fashion when Allah ( B )says:
4And the [faithful] slaves of the Most Gracious [Allah] are those who
walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish
address them [with bad words] they reply back with mild words of
gentleness.)
(Qur'an 25: 63)
This is great praise for the humble, for Allah (B)describes
them as being freed slaves to Him. This is the greatest honour for
them, because true servitude to Him (g)
is the noblest description
and the highest status for those who love Him, and they may feel
proud of that.

Our Prophet Muhammad (g)
is the epitome of this great
attribute in all shapes and fonns. There is nothing strange about that,
for he is the one who was taught by his Lord in the best way. Among
the good attitudes that Allah ( B )taught him was, as the Qur'an says:
(Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have bestowed on
certain classes ofthem [the disbelievers], nor grieve over them. And
lower your wings for the believers [be courteous to the fellowbelievers].)
(Qur'an 15: 88)
(And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.#
(Qur'an 26: 215)

Lowering the wing is a metaphor for being humble and kind
towards them."' The Prophet (g)
manifested that in the truest sense,
and the effect of humility was manifested in all these interactions, in
society and with his family, at all times and in all places. There is no
instance in which he was not humble towards Allah ( B )and the
belie~ers.'~' Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was influenced by the
teachings of the Qur'an and by his upbringing in the house of the

368

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

Prophet (g),
so this attribute. was firmly rooted in his brilliant
character. There follow some examples:

2.3.1. "I am the one who scorned
worldly adornment"
S%h ibn Abil-Aswad narrated that someone told him that he
saw 'Ali (&) riding a donkey with his feet dangling down on one
side, and he said: "I am the one who scorned worldly
Thus Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2lih (&) felt joy at his
victory over his worldly desires when he appeared before the people
in a humble manner, even though he was the caliph of the Muslim.
High worldly status is very deceptive, and the trial of status is greater
than that of wealth. How often has it happened that people in
positions of authority were seen as humble before they were
appointed to those high positions, hut afterwards, the attitnde of
superiority slowly crept into their hearts until in the end it became
difficult to talk to them or meet with them? However, in the case of
the pious close friends of Allah (&), the higher they rise in worldly
status, the more humble they become towards the people. They feel
great joy when they act in a humble way, which shows that they do
not have the attitude of arrogance and pride.202

2.3.2. "The father of the children should
carry (food for his children)"
It was narrated from 'Ali (&) that he bought some dates for a
dirham and carried them in a cloth. Some people said: "We will carry
it for you, 0 Arnir al-Mu'mineen." He said: "No, the father of the
children should carry (food for his children)."203 This is an example
of his humility, as he carried his goods himself even though he was
the caliph and was older. He did not think that his position justified
accepting the people's serving him. By doing this, he set a good

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

369

example of humility for the Muslims. If any person of prominent
position feels that it is embarrassing for him to cany his own goods,
he should remember the attitude of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&),
and his embarrassment will disappear. If anyone objects to any of the
humble people or their attitude, he should follow the example of this
man, who held the highest position on earth, and that should refute

2.3.3. 'Ali's dealing with his uncle al-'Abbss
(may AUah be pleased with them both)
It was narrated that Suhayb, the freed slave of al-'Abbgs, said:
"I saw 'Ali kissing the hands and feet of al-'Abbb and saying: 0
uncle, be pleased with me."205 Let us think about how D i r k at-TPi
described 'Ali
when he said: "He liked shorter clothes (those
that came above the ankle) and coarse food. He was just like one of
us. He would answer us if we asked him and tell us if we enquired of
him, but by Allah, although he was so close to us, we could hardly
speak to him out of respect for him."206

(4)

One of the sayings of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
concerning humility was: "Humility honours a man."207 The more
knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah a person gains, and the more he
acts upon them, the more he understands the reality of himself, and
the more humble he becomes towards AUah (s)and His creation.
The problem with those callers to Islam today who develop selfadmiration is lack of knowledge and understanding. In addition, the
caller focuses on the number of followers around him instead of
thinking of that which is with Allah ( g )or looking at the devoted
scholars who are superior to him. This is one of the subtle tricks of
the devil by which he deceives seekers of knowledge and those who
are counted as working in the field of da'wah. It was said in
Manshoor a l - H u h : "If you acquire knowledge, then do not think of

370

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

the number of ignorant people who are inferior to you; rather look at
the scholars who are superior to you."208
We will end this description in the words of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&,)I "How beautiful is the humility of the rich
person towards the poor person, hoping for the reward of Allah (B).
But better than that is the pride shown by the poor man towards the
rich man out of trust in Allah (3$)."209 What is meant by pride here is
not arrogance; it is that the poor man feels of independent means
through the help of Allah, so he does not need what the rich have.

2.4. His generosity
Another of the Qur'anic attitudes that were embodied in the
character of Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi T%b (&) was that of
generosity. The noble Qur'an heaps praises on those who are
generous. This phrase appears near the beginning of the Qur'an when
Allah (g)
says at the beginning of the second soorah, after the
Basmalah:
@l$-Inim-Meem. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qnr'an
and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] This is the Book
[the Qur'an], whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are
al-Muttaqoon [the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear
Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He
has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds
which He has ordained)]. Who believe in the Ghayb [the unseen] and
perform as-Sal& [Iqhat-as-Sal&], and spend out of what we have
provided for them 1i.e. give Zak&, spend on themselves, their
parents, their children, their wives, and also give charity to the poor
and also in Allah's cause -jihad]. And who believe in [the Qur'an
and the Sunnah] which has been sent down [revealed] to you
[Muhammad] and in that which were sent down before you [the

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

371

Tawrst (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and they believe with
certainty in the hereafter [Resurrection, recompense of their good and
had deeds, paradise and hell). They are on [true] guidance from their
(Qur'an 2: 1-5)
Lord, and they are the successful.),
And Allah (&) says:
dAnd those who remain patient, seeking their Lord's countenance,
perform as-Saliit [[Iqzmat-q-Sal$t], and spend out of that which We
have bestowed on them, secretly and openly, and defend evil with
good, for such there is a good end. 'Adn [Eden] paradise [everlasting
Gardens], which they shall enter and [also] those who acted
righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their
offspring. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate [saying]:
' S a l h u n 'Alaikum [peace he upon you] for yon persevered in
patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!') (Qur'an 13: 22-24)
The Messenger of Allah (g)
attained perfection and greatness
in all aspects of manners and attitude, especially the attitude of
generosity. Khadeejah (%) described him as follows: "You uphold
ties of kinship, spend on the weak and orphans, give to the destitute,
honour your guest and help others when they are struck by
calamity."210 She described him as having these great and sublime
attitudes even before his mission began, when he had not yet taken on
the burden of his nation. Prophethood brought him extra perfection
and greatness, so one can imagine how he would have been after all
of that. No doubt his generosity reached the ultimate pinnacle,
surpassing the generosity of the previous prophets and all of
mankind, and there is a great deal of evidence for this.'" Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) was influenced by his Qur'anic
and prophetic training, and he left us clear examples indicating that
the characteristic of generosity was deeply rooted in his sublime
character.

372

The oath ofullegiunce to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Al-Hdidh
- Ibn Katheer narrated from the report of al-Asbagh
ibn Nabgtah that: "A man came to 'ALi ibn Abi TZlib (&) and said:
'0 Amir d-Mu'mineen, I have a need that I ask of Allah before I ask
it of you. If yon fulfilit, I will praise Allah and thank you; if you do
not fulfil it, I will praise Allah, and I will not blame you.' 'Ali (&)
said: 'Write what you need on the ground, for I would not like to see
on your face the embarrassment of asking.' He wrote: 'I am in need.'
'Ali (&) said to me (the narrator): 'Bring me a suit.' I brought it, and
the man took it and put it on, then he spoke lines of poetry in praise of
'Ali (&). 'Ali (&) said: 'Bring me some dinars.' So one hundred
dinars were brought, and he gave it to him. Al-Asbagh said: '0 Amir
d-Mn'mineen, a suit and one hundred dinars?' He said: 'Yes. I heard
the Messenger of Allah (g)
say: "Treat the people according to their
status," and this is the status of this man in my view.""" This was
the noble attitude of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%ib (4)
in
meeting the needs of the poor; he paid attention to their affairs and
respected their feelings. The most brilliant aspect of this report is his
saying, 'Write what you need on the ground, for I would not like to
see on your face the embarrassment of asking." How much
humiliation and embarrassment the poor suffer before those whom
they ask for help; sometimes they may stammer or be unable to
speak. The needy man was deeply moved when Amii al-Mu'mineen
responded to him in this excellent manner, and he composed poetry
praising him.'13
'Ali (&) would feel happy when guests came; he honoured
his brothers for the sake of Allah (&)and checked on them. It was
narrated that he once said: "I have not had a guest for seven days, and
I am afraid that Allah is humiliating me."214 He also said: "Twenty
dirhams that I give to my brother for the sake of Allah (s)
is dearer
to me than giving one hundred dirhams to the poor and needy."215
When he was asked about generosity, he said: "What is initiated by

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

373

the person is true generosity; as for that which is given in response to
being asked, it is given out of embarrassment and as a favour."216
During his lifetime, Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) established
a number of endowments for the sake of Allah (&). He gave his land
in Yanbu' as an endowment, and he wrote in a document concerning
it: "These are instructions issued by 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib and his
decision concerning his wealth: I give in charity Yanbu', Wadi alQura, d-Udhaynah and Ri'ah for the sake of Allah (g)
and for
relatives near and far. It is not to be given away or inherited, whether
I am alive or dead."217 He said of hi$ charity: "I remember when I
tied a rock to my stomach because of hunger, and now my charity has
reached four thousand dinars."218 He did not mean that this four
thousand was what he had paid in zakih on his wealth; he was
referring to the endowments that he had established, the income from
which was charity of this amount. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (L&~)did
not save any money. The evidence219 for that is what his son d Hasan said about him after he was killed: "There has left you a man
who did not leave behind any yellow or white (meaning gold or
silver) except seven hundred dirhams that remain of his stipend, with
which he intended to buy a slave."z20
He used to urge people to honour their relatives and clans. He
would say: "Honour your clan, for they are your wings by which you
fly. With their help, you can achieve what you want to achieve, and
they are your support at times of hardship. Honour their prominent
ones, visit their sick, seek their advice in your affairs and help the one
who is going through hardship."221

2.5. Shyness, or modesty, before Allah (&)
Shyness, or modesty, is one of the noblest of characteristics
because it is indicative of a pure heart, a sensitive conscience,

i

374

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

strength of religious deterrent and the sense that Allah (&) is always
watching. The one who does not have any modesty does not honour
guests, fulfil promises, render hack trnsts, meet the needs of others,
try to seek the best deeds and give precedence to them, try to avoid
had deeds, cover the private parts of the body that should he covered,
or refrain from immorality. There are many people who, were it not
for this shyness, would not do any of the things that are enjoined on
them; they would not pay any attention to the rights of any created
being, uphold ties of kinship or honour their parents. The motive for
all of these deeds is either religious, in hope of a reward, or a sublime
worldly motive, which is the fear of shame before people. Thus it is
clear that were it not for shyness - either before the Creator or
before people - people would not do them.zzz
The degree of shyness depends on how alive the conscience is.
The more vibrant the conscience, the more complete this sense of
modesty will be. The lack of modesty stems from a deadening of the
heart and
Shyness is one of the branches of faith, because it
motivates one to do good deeds and prevents one from committing
sin.zz4 Hence it is a characteristic to which the noble Qur'an pays
great attention.2z5The Qur'an speaks of shyness with regard to the
Prophet (B)
in this verse: (0 you who believe! Enter not the
Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, [and
then] not [so early as] to wait for its preparation. But when you are
invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse without
sitting for a talk. Verily, such behaviour] annoys the Prophet, and he
is shy of [asking] you [to go]; but Allah is not shy of [telling you] the
truth) (Qur'an 33: 53). We can see how shyness prevented him from
confronting his Companions to ask them to leave. He could not tell
them directly what he wanted them to dozz6because he was more shy
than the virgin in her se~lnsion.~"The Prophet (g)
said: "Shyness
does not bring anything but goodness."zz8

'

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

375

This quality was manifested in the character of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&). He told us of this quality when
he said: "I feel shy before Allah that there could be any wrong done
to me that is greater than my ability to forgive, that anyone should
treat me in an ignorant manner that is greater than my patience, that
there should be any fault (that I find in a person) that could not be
covered by my concealment, or that there should be any need that
cannot be met by my generosity."2z9 These four kinds of
shortcomings found in people were met by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ibn Abi Taib with four counterparts of perfection. Shyness before
Allah requires one to have the quality of forgiveness when one has
the power to settle the score. This applies if the wrong done does not
transgress the sacred limits of Allah. One should have knowledge
that could forgive the ignorance of ignorant people, the ability to
conceal people's faults, and sufficient generosity to encompass
people's needs. What gives this ruling weight is the fact that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali connected it to shyness before Allah (g).
These
four qualities are regarded as qualities of perfection by those who are
wise. Many sensible individuals strove to acquire them in order to
gain a good reputation in this world and to be able to run the affaus of
people by gaining their support aud approval. 'Ali connected them to
shyness before Allah, because his higher aim was to seek the pleasure
of Allah. The person who has this aim will undoubtedly embody
these qualities more fully than one whose aim is merely

2.6. True submission, patience and
sincerity towards Allah (g)
'Ali (&) had a comprehensive concept of worship which
encompassed his entire life. He was distinguished by his regular
offering of voluntary prayers during the middle of the night, and he
became one of those whom Allah (&) mentions:

376

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his charuateristics & his way of lge

(Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and
hope.$
(Qur'an 32: 16)
(Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily,
they were before this Muhsinoon [good-doers]. They used to sleep
but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear
and hope]. And in the hours before dawn, they were [found] asking
[Allah] for forgiveness.B
(Qur'an 51: 16-18)
(And the [faithful] slaves of the Most Gracious [AUah] are those who
walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish
address them [with had words] they reply back with mild words of
gentleness. And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord,
prostrate and standing.)
(Qur'an 25: 63-64)
Dirk ibn Dnmayrah al-Kinhi described 'Ali ihn Ahi T%b to
MuC2wiyahihn Abi S u f y k (may Allah be pleased with them all) as
follows: "He did not feel content with this world and its adornment,
but he felt content with the night and its darkness. I bear witness by
Allah ( B )that I once saw him, when the night had dropped its
curtain and the stars had appeared deep in the sky, weeping in his
place of prayer and holding onto his beard like one who is stung with
pain, weeping and mourning. It is as if I can hear him now, saying: '0
our Lord, 0 our Lord,' beseeching Him. Then he said to this world:
' h e you trying to deceive me, or are you trying to attract me? No
way, no way. Go and deceive someone else, for I have thrice
divorced you. Your life is short, you are of no significance or
importance. Ah, how little provision we have, how long is the
journey and how lonely the road!"' At that, Mu'gwiyah's tears fell
down onto his beard; he could not stop them. He srarted to dry them
with his sleeve, and the people began to sob. He said: "This is how
Abu al-Hasan was, may Allah (&)have mercy on him. How sad do
you feel for losing him, 0 Dir%f?" He said: "As sad as the mother

I
!

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

377

whose only son was slaughtered in her lap. Her tears never cease, and
her grief never ends." Then he got up and left.231
Al-Ashtar an-Nakba'i entered upon Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ihn Abi T2ib (&) when he was standing and praying at night, and
he said to him: "0Amir al-Mu'mineen, fasting by day, staying up at
night and striving hard in between." When 'Ali
had finished his
prayer, he said to him: "The journey to the hereafter is long and needs
to be crossed by travelling at night."Z3ZAmir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn
Abi T2ih
used to encourage the people to he conscious of Allah
(B),to remember that He is always watching, and to fear Him. He
said: "0 people, fear the One Who hears if you speak and Who
knows if you conceal something. Prepare for death, which will catch
up with you if you try to flee, and will take you if you stay."233 He
also used to say: "0 people, learn from me these words, which you
will never find the like of, even if you ride camels and wear them out
trying: No person should hope in anyone hut his Lord, and he should
not fear anything but his sin. If he does not know something, he
should not feel embarrassed to try to learn; if he is asked about
something that he does not h o w , he should not feel embarrassed to
say 'I do not h o w . ' You should realise that patience is to faith as the
head is to the body, and there is nothing good in a body which has no
head. "234

This advice is a combination of principles of tawheed and
guidelines on the etiquette of acquiring knowledge, as he advised
people to have the correct type of fear and hope. The tme believer
does not place his hope in anyone but Allah (g),
because He is the
only One Who gives all these blessings. As for the people at whose
hands the blessings come, they are no more than the means; the
Initiator and Creator of the blessings is Allah (&). The tme believer
does not fear anything but Allah (g),
because He is the One Who
can cause h m or bring benefit. As for the created things that people

378

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

imagine are sources of fear, they and all creation are under the control
of Allah. He is the only Provider, the only Creator, the only
Sovereign and the One Who is able to do all things, so why should
the believer fear or put his trust in anything else? Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) expressed fear of Allah (&) as fear of sin, because what is
meant is the fear of the consequences of sin, which is the punishment
of Allah; thus, this is the main means of achieving true fear of Allah.
'Ali (&) then explained some of the etiquette of learning,
because religious knowledge can only be acquired by learning. He
explained that one aspect of the etiquette to he followed by the
leamer is that shyness should not prevent him from leaming, even if
he is old or of a high status; similarly, shyness should not prevent him
from saying, 'I do not know', for these words offer more protection
for his religious commitment and that of the one who asks him.
Then he concluded his beneficial advice by stating one of the
fundamental principles of faith, which is patience; he described it as
being to faith like the head is to the body. That is because success is
based on patience in all matters, whether they relate to this world or
to the hereafter.235Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Mi (&>) demonstrated the
quality of patience throughout his life: when he became a Muslim in
secret with the Messenger of Allah (g)
at a very early age, through
all the times when he fought in battles and campaigns, at the time of
the Rightly Guided Caliphs with all the serious events that
accompanied that era, and then throughout the difficult turmoils that
he faced during his own caliphate, which ended in his murder. In all
the stages of his life, there are beautiful lessons for those who seek to
call people to Islam today. These lessons highlight what is required of
patience, perseverance and a willingness to pay the price when
calling people to ~ l l a h seeking
~ ~ ~ ,thereby the pleasure of Allah.
'Ali (&) used to encourage his companions to be patient. He
said to al-Ash'ath ibn Qays: "If you are patient, the decree of Allah

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

379

(g)
will be carried out on you, and you will be rewarded. But if you
panic and show impatience, the decree of Allah (&) will be carried
out on you while you are burdened with sin (and thus you will be
doomed)."237He (&) also said: "Patience is to faith as the head is to
the body; if the head-iscut off, the body is mined." Then he raised his
voice and said: "The one who has no patience has no faith."z3s He
also said: "Patience is a mount that never tires."
Patience occupies a well-known position in the religion of
Allah. Allah (&) mentions patience in many verses of the Qur'an,
such as the verse in which He says: (Only those who are patient shall
receive their reward in full,without reckoningb (Qur'an 39: 10). The
virtues of patience are also mentioned in many hadiths. Patience is of
three types: Patience in obeying AUah (@), patience in refraining
from disobeying Allah and patience in bearing calamity.
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib was keen that his
actions should be sincerely for the sake of Allah (B),
in accordance
with the words of Allah ($1:
(Say [O Muhammad]: My Lord has commanded justice and [said]
that you should face Him only [i.e. worship none but AUah and face
the Qiblah, i.e. the Ka'hah at Makkah during prayers] in each and
every place of worship, in prayers [and not to face other false deities
and idols], and invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him
[by not joining in worship any partner with Him and with the
intention that you are doing your deeds for Allah's sake only]. As He
brought you [into being] in the beginning, so shall you be brought
into being [on the Day of Resurrection in two groups, one as a
blessed one (believers), and the other as a wretched one
(disbe1ievers)l.b
(Qur'an 7: 29)
(Say [O Muhammad], 'I am only a man like you. It has been revealed
to me that your Ilhh [God] is One Ilhh [God - i.e. Allah]. So

380

The oath of allegiance fo 'Ali, his characferistics & his way o f life

whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work
righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his
~ord.'B
(Qur'an 18: 110)

60,call you [O Muhammad and the believers] upon [or invoke]
Allah making [your] worship pure for Him [Alone] [by worshipping
none hut Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah's sake
only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in
worship], however much the disbelievers [in the Oneness of Allah]
may hate [it].)
(Qur'an 40: 14)

Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (+$) learned from the
Messenger of Allah (g)
that good deeds are not accepted unless they
are done with a sincere intention. Sincerity is a basic pillar of
worship, and worship in which there is no sincerity will he rejected,
as it says in this hadith, whose meaning was revealed to the Prophet
(g)
from Allah: "I am the least in need of a partner. Whoever does
any deed in which he arsociates someone else with Me, I will reject
him and his deed."z39 'Ali (&) fought polytheism in all forms and
types, whether it related to not believing in the Lordship of Allah or
to performing acts of worship to other than Allah. He was keen to
ensure that all of his actions were done sincerely for the sake of Allah
(&) alone, and he would encourage people, especially seekers of
knowledge, to avoid showing off. He said: "0hearers of knowledge,
act upon it, for the knowledgeable one is the one who acts on what he
knows and whose actions and knowledge are in harmony. There will
he people who acquire knowledge, but it does not go any deeper than
their collarbones; how they are inwardly will be contrary to how they
appear to be, and their actions will differ from their knowledge. They
will lead study circles and compete with one another to the extent that
one will get angry with a person in his circle if he leaves him to go
and sit with someone else. Those people's actions do not ascend from
their gatherings to Allah (&)."240

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

381

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) pointed out some serious
diseases in those who sit to teach people for the purpose of boasting
and gaining a reputation. They become angry with their students if
they leave and go to someone else, even if doing so is in their best
interests, because the student's best interests do not matter to such
people; what matters to them is their status and reputation. Even if
they do not actually %saythat, it is obvious from their attitude.241For
one who calls people to Allah (&) sincerely, the main concern
should be that the people follow the truth, even if they follow a view
that is different from his. This was the way of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi mib (&), who said: "Judge as you used to judge, for I
hate differences, (and I shall do my best) to keep the people united or
die as my predecessors died.""' That was with regard to his opinion
that it is not permissible to sell a slave woman who has borne a child
to her master. 'Umar held the same view, hut 'Ali changed his mind
and decided that these slave women could be sold.243This is a lesson
for those who call people to Islam and for seekers of knowledge.
Legitimate differences of opinion are something natural, one should
not object to them, and they should not affect the unity of Muslims.
Those who call people to Islam today are in the greatest need of
checking themselves with regard to this attitude and their stance on it;
they need to beseech Allah ($$) to grant them this good quality so
that they may attain the reward of AUah ( B )after they die and so that
their da'wah efforts may bear fruit during their lifetime.
Ali's worship was based on complete sincerity towards Allah
(&) and adherence to the guidance of the Prophet (@, for Allah
( B )is the only One Who is deserving of worship. 'AIi's entire life
consisted of worship, moving from one type to another in obedience
to the words of AUah

(a):

(Say 10 Muhammad]: 'Verily, my Sal% [prayer], my sacrifice, my
living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the '.&meen

382

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

[mankind, jinn and all that exists]. He has no partner. And of this I
have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.'#
(Qur'an 6: 162-163)
Worship was an important factor in purifying and enhancing
his good attitude and in his observance of the laws of Allah (&).
Hence Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), in his commentary on the
verse %Verily, those who say: 'Our Lord is [only] Allah,' and
thereafter stand firm [on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism], on them
shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve# (Qur'an 46: 13), explained
'standing f
' as referring to the performance of the obligatory
duties of slam."'^

2.7. His gratitude to Allah (%)
Gratitude means using all the blessings that one has received
for the purpose for which one was created.245Ln other words, all the
blessings, both apparent and hidden, in oneself and in one's wealth,
should he dedicated to worshipping one's Lord in a befitting manner,
using every faculty that Allah (&)has given in the most perfect way.
A person who does that will have acknowledged and shown the
blessings that Allah ( B )has bestowed upon him and will have
fulfilled the duty of giving thanhs to Him (s)."~ Gratefnlness is one
of the most important attitudes that the believer should have in all
situations, because in doing so be is attributing blessings to the One
Who granted them. The high-ranking position of gratitude is
indicated by the fact that other good Islamic attitudes, such as love,
contentment and bust, stem from it. Gratitude is not complete unless
it is accompanied by these other attitudes, and it cannot be achieved
unless one feels these other qualities, too.247
The noble Qur'an paid a great deal of attention to gratitude, as
befits its noble position. It is mentioned in more than seventy verses,
which is indicative of how serious and important this attitude is.m

1

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

383

There are verses that enjoin and encourage it, praise those who have
this quality, promise a good reward and warn against its opposite.
Allah ( B )mentions remembrance of Him and gratitude together:
*Therefore remember Me b y praying, glorifying]. I will remember
you, and be grateful to Me [for My countless Favours on you] and
never be ungrateful to Meb (Qur'an 2: 152).He also mentions worship
together with gratitude: (So seek your provision from Allah [alone],
and worship Him [alone], and be grateful to Him. To Him [alone]
you will be brought back) (Qur'an 29: 17). This indicates that there is
a strong connection between worship dedicated to Allah
alone
and gratitude.m9

(s)

The Messenger of Allah (&) occupied the highest position in

all praisewoAy attitudes, including this one, which he taught to his

(4).

Companions, including 'Ali ibn Abi Taib
He did not become
aware of any blessing without giving thanks to Allah
for it.
When he came out of the washroom, he would wipe his stomach with
his hand and say: "What a great blessing; would that people gave
thanks for it.""' It was narrated from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
that he said to a man from Hamadb: "Blessing is connected to
gratitude, and gratitude leads to more blessings; they a e attached to
one another, so more blessings from Allah (g)
will not cease unless
gratitude from the person ceases."251 'Ali (&) thought that part of
gratitude was forgiving one's opponents, and he said: "If you gain
power over your enemy, then make your forgiveness a sign of your
gratitude for gaining power over him."252

(s)

2.8. Supplication to Allah (%)
Supplication is a very i m p o m t matter. If a person begins to
offer a great deal of supplication, he will be showered with goodness
and blessings. Hence Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (A)was very keen to
have a good relationship with Allah (&)and to offer a great deal of

384

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

supplication. Allah (g)
says: (And your Lord said: 'Invoke Me [i.e.
believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for
anything] I will respond to your [invocation]. Verily, those who
scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My
Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter hell in
humiliation.')r (Qur'an 40: 60)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Aliibn Abi Tilib (&) kept close to the
and saw how he used to seek the help and
Messenger of Allah (g:)
support of Allah
He (&) was eager to learn this worship from
the Messenger of Allah (g)
and to ensure that his supplication was
offered in the manner that was enjoined by the Messenger of Allah
(&) and with which he was pleased. The Muslim should not give
precedence to any versions of supplications, glorification of Allah
( B )or prayers that were not narsated from the Prophet (g),
no
matter how beautiful the wording or the meaning may appear. The
Messenger of Allah (&) is the best teacher and guide to the straight
path, and he knew best what is better and more perfect.

(s).

Some people falsely attribute fabricated, innovated
supplications and phrases of remembrance to Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&), but the one who loves him should follow his
way and his method.-~etaught us to follow the Prophet (g)
in word
and deed. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) was a person
whose supplications were answered. It was narrated from Zadhin
Abu 'Umar that a man told 'Ali (&) something, and he remarked: "I
think you are lying to me." The man said: "No, I am not." 'Ali (&)
asked: "Shall I pray against you if you are lying?" The man said: "Go
ahead." So 'Ali (&)prayed (offered supplication), and shortly after
that, the man became blind.253 'Ali (&) used to say when he was
praised: "0 Allah, forgive me for what they do not know about me,
do not hold me accountable for what they say, and make me better
than what they think."'54

i

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) narrated that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "If any one of you sneezes, let him say
'Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah).' Those around him should
respond by saying 'Yarhamuk-Allah (May AUah have mercy on
you).' And he should respond to them by saying ' Y a h d e e hAllah
wa yuflaha bZlakum (May Allah guide you and rectify your
condition)."'255 This action reflects a good attitude and good
manners towards AUah (s)
by praising Him in a situation where one
is enjoined to give thanks. Al-Haleemi said: Sneezing wards off harm
from the brain, where one's power of thought resides and from which
the nervous system starts, through which a person has his senses.
With soundness of the brain, all other faculties will remain sound.
Thus it becomes clear that it is a great blessing, so it is appropriate to
respond with praise of Allah because that is acknowledging that
AUah (&)is the Creator Who has all power; it is attributing creation
to Him and not to natural processes.256

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) demonstrated some of the
etiquette of the traveller in the report that he narrated from the
Messenger of AUah (s):
"When the Prophet (g)
wanted to travel,
he would say: 'By Your help, O Allah, I prevail. By Your help I
travel around, and by Your help I

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b
demonstrated
another point of the traveller's etiquette. When he set out to travel and
placed his foot in the stirrnp, he said: "Bismillah (in the name of
AUah)." When be had mounted the animal, he said: "Al-hamdu
Lillah (praise be to Allah)." Then he said: BGlory to Him Who has
subjected this to us, and we could never have it (by our efforts). And
verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to rehlrn) (Qur'an 43: 13-14).Then
he said "Al-&mdu LilZBh (praise be to Allah)" three times and
"AllZhu akbar (AUah is most Great)" three times, then: "0 Allah,
there is no god but You. Verily I have wronged myself, so forgive

386

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

me, for surely no one can forgive sins except You." Then he smiled.
It was said to him: "Why are you smiling, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen?"
He said: "I saw the Prophet (g)
doing what I have done and saying
what I have said, then he smiled. We said: 'Why are you smiling, 0
Prophet of Allah?' He said: 'I am amazed by a person who says,
'there is no god but You, verily I have wronged myself, so forgive
me, for surely no one can forgive sins except You', knowing that no
one forgives sin except ~ i m . " ' ~ ~ ~

It was narrated that Ibn A'had said: "Ali ibn Abi T%b (&)
said to me: '0 Ibn A'bad, do you know what the right of food is? I
said: 'What is its right, 0 'Ali ibn Abi Taib?' He said: 'You should
say: In the name of Allah, 0 AUah, bless us in that which You have
provided for us.' He said: 'Do you know how to give thanks for it
when you have finished?' I said: 'How should I give thanks for it?'
He said: 'By saying: Praise be to Allah, Who has fed us and given us
to drink."'259
When 'Ah saw the new moon, he would say: "0 Allah, I ask
you for the good of this month and its support, help, blessings,
provision, light, purity and guidance. I seek refuge in You from its
evil, and the evil of what is in it, and the evil of what comes after
it,n260

He used to say when prostrating: "0 Lord, I have wronged
myself, so forgive me."261 Between the two prostrations, he would
say: "0 Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, support me and grant
me provision."262 He taught the people to recite this supplication
when entering the marketplace: ''In the name of Allah, the Most
Gracious, the Most Merciful. I put my trust in Allah, and there is no
power and no strength except in Allah. 0 Allah, I seek refuge in Yon
from a false oath and a losing deal, and from the evil of what is in this
market."263 He used to say: "There are no words dearer to Allah ( B )
than a person's saying: '0 Allah, there is no god but You. 0 Allah, I

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

387

do not worship anyone but You. 0 Allah, I do not associate anything
with You. 0 Allah, I have wronged myself, so forgive me my sins,
for no one forgives sins but Y ~ u . " He
' ~ also
~ ~ used to say: "0Allah,
make us steadfast in adhering to justice and fairness and what is right;
make us adhere to the Book, guided and guiding others, content and
making others content, not going astray or leading others astray."265
Another of 'Ali's supplications was: "0 Allah, I ask you by
Your mercy that encompasses all things, by Your might that
overwhelms all things, by Your glory that prevails over all things, by
Your sovereignty that encompasses all things, by Your power that
nothing can resist, by Your light that illuminates all things, by Your
knowledge that encompasses all things, by Your name that prevails
over all things, and by Your eternal countenance that remains after all
things have perished. 0 Allah, 0 Most Gracious, 0 Most Merciful,
forgive me my sins that incur Your wrath and the sins that generate
regret. Forgive me the sins that keep away blessings, and forgive me
the sins that change blessings into their opposite. Forgive me the sins
that bring down calamity and cause enemies to prevail. Forgive me
the sins that cause rain to be withheld and supplications to be
rejected. Forgive me the sins that would doom me to hell."266 This
supplication demonstrates Ali's sense of needing his Lord and dso
his fear of his sin; it shows us how we should deal with the beautiFul
names of Allah (&) and call upon Him by them. This supplication
also sheds light on the true sense of servitude to AUah (g)
that was
felt by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Aliibn Abi T%b (&).
It is also narrated that 'Ali (&) said: "The Messenger of Allah
(B)taught me these words and told me that if any calamity or
hardship befell me, I should say them: 'There is no god hut Allah, the
Forbearing, the Most Generous. Glory be to Him. Blessed be Allah,

say these words, recite them over one who was sick with a fever, and
teach them to his daughter, who was living away from home.268
These are some of the characteristics that were the fruit of his
tawheed, his faith in Allah and his preparations to meet Allah (&).
As we cover the events of his Life, the reader will notice many of his
attributes, including courage, forbearance and eloquence.

2.9. The ultimate reference points
for the government of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&)
The ultimate reference points for the government of A& dMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) were the Book of Allah (g)
and
the Sunnah of His Messenger (&),following the example of the two
shaykhs Ahu Bakr and 'umar~(mayAllah be pleased with them).

2.9.1. The Book of Allah (&)
Allah (s)says: dSurely, We have sent down to you [O
Muhammad] the Book [this Qur'an] in truth that you might judge
between men by that which Allah has shown you [i.e.has taught you
through Divine Revelation], so be not a pleader for the treacherous)
(Qur'an 4: 105). The Book of Allah contains all Sharia rnlings that
have to do with worldly affairs. The noble Qur'an also tells the
Muslims everything they need to know of the foundations on which
their state is to be established. Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib
(&>) said: "Adhere to your religion, follow the guidance of your
Prophet, follow his Snnnah and try to find an answer in the Qnr'an
about whatever you are uncertain of. Whatever the Qur'an approves,
adhere to it, and whatever it disapproves of, turn away from it."269

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib

389

2.9.2. The Sunnah
The Islamic constitntion is derived from the Sunnah, from
which it is possible to find out the proper way of implementing and
executing the rulings of the noble ~ u r ' a n . ~Amir
~ ' al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi Titlib (&) said: "Follow the guidance of your Prophet
(@),for it is the best of guidance, and follow his way, for it is the best
of ways."2"

2.9.3. Following the example of
the Rightly Guided Caliphs
The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Follow the example of
those who come after me, Abu Bakr and mar."^^^ Arnir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi Titlib (&) said concerning Ahu Bakr and
'Umar (&): "By the One Who causes the seed to split and sprout
and the One Who created the soul, no one loves them but a pious
believer, and no one hates them but an immoral evildoer. They
accompanied the Messenger of Allah
with sincerity and loyalty,
enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and they never
did anything contrruy to what the Messenger of Allah (@) wanted to
do. The Messenger of Allah (g)
never regarded anyone else's advice
as equal to theirs, and he never loved anyone else as he loved them.
When the Messenger of Allah (g)
died, he was pleased with them;
and when they died, the believers were pleased with them." He
continued speaking until he said concerning Abu Bakr (4):
"He
was the best of those who remained; he was more merciful than
anyone else, more kind, more pious and senior in terms of age and
Islam. He led us as the Messenger of Allah (g)
had led us until he
died like that, then 'Umar was appointed in charge after him ... He
conducted affairs according to the way of the Prophet (g)
and his
companion (Abu Bakr), following in their footsteps as the camel calf
follows its mother... Who do you know who is like them? May Allah

(s)

390

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

( B )have mercy on them, and may Allah (&)help us to follow their
path. No one can attain what they attained except by following in
their footsteps and loving them. So whoever loves me, let him love
them. Whoever does not love them hates me, and I have nothing to do
with him."273
'Ali defended the actions of 'Uthmin ibn 'Affgn, saying: "0
people, do not go to extremes (in criticising) 'Uthmin, and do not say
anything but good about him. For by Allah (B),
he did not do what
be did (to the mushafs) except on the basis of the agreement of us all
-meaning the Companions. If I were in his position, I would have
done the same as he did."274 He also used to say: "I would not undo a
knot that 'Umar tied."275

2.10. The right of the Ummah
to keep watch on its rulers
The Ummah has the right to keep watch on its rulers and set
them straight. Allah (&) says:

4Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is
good @slam],enjoining al-Ma'roof [i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all
that Islam orders one to do] and forbidding al-Munkar [polytheism
and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden]. And it is they who are
(Qur'an 3: 104)
the successful.8

(4)

The first thing that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali
said after he
was appointed was: "No one has any right to this matter (the position
of leader) except the one you appoint, and I cannot decide any matter
without your
This is similar to what Abu Bakr (&)
said when he was appointed: "If I do well, then help me, and if I do
wrong, then set me straight."277 'Umar said something like it: '"The
dearest of people to me is the one who points out my mistakes to
me.,,278 c Umar also said: "I am afraid that I may do wrong and no one

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

391

will stop me for fear of me."z79 'Utbmin said something with the
same meaning: "If you find in the Book of Allah ( B )that you should
put my leg in chains, then put my leg in chains."z80This is how the
caliphs acted in the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. They
submitted to the right of the Ummah to watch over the rulers, and no
one objected, which indicates that there was agreement on this.28'
The consensus of the Companions -as rulers and subjects at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs can only mean one thing,
which is a sound understanding of the Qur'an and the proper way of
acting upon the Snnnah. They were there at the time when the Book
was being revealed, and they witnessed the way that the Prophet
told the people to live in accordance with the Qur'an. They are the
ones who best understood the spirit of this religion, were most
knowledgeable about the aims of Sharia and were most able to
distinguish between truth and falsehood. It is most unlikely -rather
it is impossible -that they would agree on falsehood, because the
Prophet (g)
-, said: "My Ummah will never unite on misguidance."282
Hence their consensus is regarded as evidence to which attention
must be paid and that should be included in the sources of the Islamic
constitution. The consensus of the Ummah may be on the
understanding of a text, or they may agree on an analogy, and that
becomes evidence.283

(a)

During his caliphate, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali encouraged the
people to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. One day he
gave a speech in which he praised and glorified Allah, then he said:
"0people, what destroyed those before you was that they committed
sins, and the devoted scholars and rabbis did not stop them, thus they
were seized by punishment. So enjoin what is good and forbid what
is evil before there befalls you the like of what befell them, and
remember that enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil
does not stop provision and does not bring one closer to death."284

2.11. Consultation
One of the principles of the Islamic state is the obligation of
the leaders and rulers to consult with the Muslims, listening to their
views and ruling on the basis of consultation. Allah (&) says:
(And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had
you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away
from about you; so pass over [their faults], and ask [Allah's]
forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you
have taken a decision, put your trust in AUah, certainly, AUah loves
those who put their trust [in Him].)
(Qur'an 3: 159)
4And those who answer the Call of their Lord [i.e. to believe that He
is the only One Lord (Allah), and to worship none but Him Alone],
and perform as-Salrih [Zqrimat-as-Salcih], and who [conduct] their
affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend of what We have
bestowed on them.)
(Qur'an 42: 38)
Tbe verse mentions together two things: rule by consultation
among the Muslims and the establishment of prayer. This indicates
that the ruling on consultation is as important as the ruling on prayer;
thus consultation is a religious obligation.285Amir d-Mu'rnineen
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) was keen to adhere to the method of
consultation in his dealings, actions and decisions. For example,
when he received a letter from his commander Ma'qil ibn Qays arRiy&, who was in charge of fighting the Kharijite al-Khirreet ibn
Rhhid, he gathered his companions and read the letter to them. He
consulted them and asked for their opinions until most of them
agreed on one opinion, namely: "We think that you should write to
Ma'qil ibn Qays and tell him to seek out the evildoer and keep after
him until he kills him or banishes him, lest be tum the people against

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

393

Another report narrated from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
tells us that he said: "Consultation is the essence of guidance. The
one who bases his actions on his own opinions without consulting
others is in grave danger."z87 He also said: "What a great support
when you seek consultation, and what a bad preparation when you do
not consult anyone."288He said: "The view of an old man is better
than what the young man sees with his own eye."z89
When Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) sent Mil& ibn al-Hikith
al-Ashtar to Egypt, he gave him this advice concerning consultation:
"Do not include among your advisers any miser, because he will
advise you not to be generous and will make you fear poverty. Do not
include any coward, because he will weaken your resolve. Do not
include anyone who is covetous, because he will try to make you
accumulate things by unjust means. Miserliness, cowardice and
covetousness are different types of inclinations that are based on
thinking badly of Allah (&)."290

'Ali (&) held the view that if the ruler did not have any
advisers, he would not he aware of what was good and had in the way
the state was run, and he would he unaware of many issues of state
and ruling. He knew that consultation would enable him to find out
what he did not already know, and it would remove uncertainty in all
matters on which he had to make decisions. He said to al-Ashtar anNakha'i, when he appointed him as governor of Egypt: "Examine the
profiles of the workers whom you appoint, and let your appointment
of them be on the basis of qualification and not on the basis of
favouritism or preference. Appointing people to official positions on
the basis of favouritism is injustice and betrayal of Allah
and it
causes great harm to the people. People's affairs cannot be run
soundly, and neither can the affairs of governors, unless the
governors choose those who are most qualified to manage the
people's affairs and choose their workers to take care of matters that

(s),

394

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

they cannot handle themselves. For positions of authority, choose
people who are pious, dignified, knowledgeable and kind. Make sure
that they are experienced, intelligent and modest people from
righteous families, who are religiously committed and pious, because
they are the noblest in attitude and more careful in protecting
themselves from falling into error; they are the least greedy and are
more aware of the consequences of things than others. These should
be your workers and helpers."291

2.12. Justice and equality
One of the aims of Islamic rule is to establish the foundations
of the Islamic system, which plays a role in the establishment of
Muslim society. Among the most important of these foundations are
justice and equality. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (A)
established
justice among the people. His good qualities and his deep knowledge
and understanding joined together to make him qualified to play this
role in the most perfect manner, to the extent that the Messenger (@$,
because of his confidence in hiill and in his abilities, sent him to
Yemen as a judge.292 The Messenger of Allah (g)offered this
excellent supplication for him: "0 Allah, make his tongue steadfast
(in speaking the tmth) and guide his heart."293
It was natural that he should establish his rule on the basis of
comprehensive justice and make that his main objective, because by
means of justice the affairs of state become sound, and love and
harmony prevail among the people.294 Undoubtedly, justice in the
mind of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was the justice of Islam,
which is the main foundation on which Islamic society and Islamic
rule are based. Islam cannot exist in a society where injustice prevails
and justice is not known.

II

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

395

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) was exemplary in
his justice; he captured hearts and dazzled minds. The view that he
hied to implement was that justice was one of the most important
pillars of the Rightly Guided Caliphate, a practical means of calling
people to Islam and opening their hems to faith. This was the method
followed by the Messenger (g),
as his rule was based on total justice
among people.
It was narrated that Shurayh said: "When 'Ali (&)
. . set out to
fight MuZ2wiyah(&), he lost a shield. When the battle was over and
he returned to Kufah, he found a shield in the possession of a Jewish
man who was selling it in the marketplace. He said to him: '0 Jew,
this shield is my shield; I did not sell it or give it away.' The Jew said:
'It is my shield and is in my possession.' 'Ali (&) said: ' k t us go to
the judge.' So they went to Shurayh, and 'Ali (&) sat beside
Shurayh, while the Jew sat in front of him. Shurayh said: 'Speak, 0
Amir al-Mu'mineen.' He said: 'Yes. I say that this shield that is in the
Jew's hands is my shield; I did not sell it or give it away.' Shurayh
said: '0 Amiu al-Mu'mineen, give me proof.' He said: 'Yes.
~ u n b n r ?al-Hasan
~~
and al-Husayn will bear witness that this shield
is my shield.' Shurayh said: 'The testimony of the son for the father
does not count.' 'ALi (&) said: 'The testimony of a man who is one
of the people of paradise does not count? I heard the Messenger of
Allah (g)
say: "Al-Hasan and al-Husayn will be the leaders of the
youth among the people of paradise.rr ,296 The Jew said: 'The Amir
al-Mn'mineen brought me to his judge, and his judge is r u h g against
him? I bear witness that this is the truth; I bear witness that there is no
God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (@J,
and that the shield is your shield. You were riding on your dusky
camel, heading towards Siffeen; you dropped this (shield) at night,
and I picked it up.' 'Ali (&) said: 'Since you admit it, it is yours,'
and he gave him a horse too. I saw him when he went out to fight the
Kharijites with 'Ali at ~ a h a n v i n . " ~ ~ ~

396

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Another example of his justice in d i n g was narrated by alQurashi from his father, who said: "We were standing at the gate of
the palace when 'Ali
came out to us. When he saw us, we
stepped back out of respect; when he had passed, we walked behind
him. While he was like that, a man called out: 'Help for the sake of
Allah (;&)!' There were two men fighting. He punched one on the
chest and then the other, and told them to move away from one
another. One of them said: '0Amir al-Mu'mineen, this man bought a
sheep from me, and I stipulated to him that he should not give me any
faulty dirhams. He gave me a faulty dirham, so I returned it to him,
and he slapped me.' 'Ali
said to the other one: 'What do you
say?' He sajd: 'He is telling the truth, 0 Amir d-Mu'mineen.' He
said: 'So give him what he stipulated.' Then he said to the one who
had slapped him: 'Sit down,' and he said to the one who had been
slapped: 'Settle the score.' He said: 'Or pardon, 0 Amir d Mu'mineen?' 'Ali (&) said: 'It is up to you.' When the man left,
'Ali (&) said: '0 Muslims, grab him (the other one).' They caught
him, and he was carried on a man's back as you would carry a
schoolboy, and he was given fifteen lashes. 'Ali (&) said: 'This is a
punishment because yon transgressed against him.' According to
another report he said: 'This is the right of the ruler."'298

(4)

(4)

This report is regarded as a wonderful example of humility
because Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) came out of his house to go to
the marketplace and check on the people's situation, and he himself
solved their proble~ns.This is the kind of sublime behaviour that
makes the presence of the rnlers felt in the real life of the people,
whether that is done by the caliph or someone of lower rank. It is not
essential to do it every day, but it is sufficient to make people feel that
the rulers are with them to deal with their problems and to reassure
people that no one is going to transgress against them or their due
rights, and that they can regain their rights if they are violated. It also
discourages anyone who thinks of transgressing against the people's

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

397

rights. Over and above that, it deters anyone who thinks of
transgressing against the rights of Allah (g).
This strong bond between the rulers and the people may be
manifested in different ways, as suited to the ways of life in different
eras. No one should say that what Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did
is something that was possible in his era but is far-fetched in the time
we are living in, because it does not matter how it is done. What
matters are the aims and goals by means of which a happy life is
guaranteed for the Muslims, and that is achieved by paying attention
to the rights of Allah (%) first of all, and then the rights of the people,
both general and specific. The fact that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) ordered that the punishment be carried out on the transgressor,
even though the one who was transgressed against pardoned him, is
indicative of his understanding of the goal of Islam, which is to
preserve security and spread peace among the believers. Thus Islam
seeks to deter those who are inclined to violate the rights of others,
because they know that the punishment will be carried out on them
even if their victims let them off.299
Another example of 'Ali's justice was narrated by '&im ibn
Kulayb from his father, who said: "Some wealth from sfa ah an^^^ was
brought to 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&), and he divided it into seven parts.
Within that was a loaf of bread. He divided it into seven parts, and on
each share of the treasure he put a piece of bread. Then he drew lots
to determine which of them would be given first."301
With regard to the principle of equality followed by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) in his state, it is regarded as one
of the general principles that are confirmed by Islam. Allah
says:
4 0 mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and
made you into nations and tribes, that yon may know one another.
Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that [believer] who
has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily,
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.# (Qur'an 49: 13)

(s)

398

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

'Ali's implementation of this principle is the best model. We
have seen his keenness to divide wealth on an equal basis among the
people as soon as it reached him, after deducting from it what was
needed for the expenses of state. He never allowed himself to take
anything from this wealth except as much as he gave to other people.
He gave stipends to his opponents among the Khxijites, just as he
gave to others. (That was before they shed blood and transgressed
against the people.)302He (&)
.. gave to the people equally, following
the example of Abu Batcr (&). He did not give precedence to a
nobleman over a commoner, or to an Arab over a non-Arab.
On one occasion, he gave equal shares of food and money to
two women, one of whom was Arab while the other was not. The
former objected, saying: "By AUah, I am an Arab woman, and this
woman is a non-Arab." 'Ali
replied: "By Allah, I do not see
any reason to give precedence to the offspring of Ism2'eel over the
offspring of Ishiiq with regard to this wealth." Similarly, when he
was asked to give precedence to the noble Arabs and Quraysh over
the freed slaves and non-Arabs, he said: "No, by Allah. If it were my
own wealth, I would divide it equally among the people, so how
about when it is the people's own wealth?"303

(4)

It was narrated that Yahya ibn Salamah said: "Ali appointed
'Amr ibn Salamah as governor of Isfahan, and he came bringing its
wealth and some skins containing honey and ghee. Umm Kulthoom
bint 'Ali sent word to 'Amr, asking him for ghee and honey, and he
sent to her a container of honey and a container of ghee. The next day,
'Ali (&) went out and brought the wealth, honey and ghee to be
divided: He counted the vessels and found two missing. He asked
' A m about them, and he did not tell him anything, but he said: 'I shall
bring them for you.' 'Ali (&,)insisted that he should tell him what he
had done with them, so he told him. 'Ali (&) sent word to Umm
Kulthoom. He took the two vessels from her and saw that some was

missing from them. He told the traders to estimate how much was
missing from them, and it was three dirhams' worth. So he sent word
to her and took it from her, then he shared out the total amount."304
It was narrated from Ahu R S ' , the storekeeper for 'Ali (&)
who was in charge of the public treasury, that he said: "He came in
one day, and his daughter had adorned herself. He saw her wearing
pearls that he recognised from the public treasury. He said: 'Where
did she get this from? By Allah, I shall cut off her hand.' When I saw
that he was serious, I said: 'By Allah, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, I
adorned my niece with them. How could she obtain them if I did not
give them to her?' And he fell ~ilent."~''

2.13. Freedom
Freedom was one of the basic principles of government at the
time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. This principle dictates that all
freedoms should be guaranteed and protected, within the limits of
Sharia and in a way that does not contradict it. Islam calls for the
freedom of all people, in a comprehensive call the like of which is
rarely found in history.
The first call, found in a number of Qur'anic verses, is for the
people to affirm the unity of AUah ( B )and to direct worship to Him
alone, to the exclusion of all other beings and creatures. This call to
tawheed brings freedom and independence for all people. Moreover,
Islam recognises freedom in all senses and all aspects. Sometimes the
call is positive, such as enjoining what is good and forbidding what is
evil, and sometimes it is negative, such as refraining from forcing
anyone to enter Islam. In many cases, the concept of freedom is
merged with concepts of mercy, justice, consultation and equality,
because each of these principles that Islam promotes cannot be sound
and cannot be achieved except in the presence of freedom. During the
rule of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, the principle of freedom

400

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

contributed effectively to the spread of the religion of Islam. It
facilitated the Muslim conquests and the expansion of the state's
tenitory, because Islam honours human beings and guarantees their
freedom in the most comprehensive manner. The political systems
that were prevalent at that time, in the Byzantine and Persian empires,
were tyrannical and dictatorial systems in which power was
concentrated in the hands of a few. They caused suffering and the
worst degree of suppression, persecution and injustice to people,
especially political opponents and religious minorities. However, in
Islam at the time of the Prophet (g)
and the Rightly Guided Caliphs,
the general freedom that is known nowadays was known and
protected.3"
On a number of occasions, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi
T2ih
defended freedom, and he took a number of actions that
supported this principle in Muslim society. One of his sayings was:
'What a bad provision for the hereafter to transgress against the
people."307 This brief statement indicates that transgressing against
the people in any way is not permissible in Islam, and it reminds
transgressors of the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. It
is known that he also said: "It is not justice to judge against the man of
sound character on the basis of speculation."308 These words clearly
indicate that it is not permissible to judge people on the basis of mere
speculation and doubts; rather it should be on the basis of certainty that
is founded on irrefutable evidence, and the best of this evidence is that
which the Sharia stipulates. Thus the principle that was established by
modem criminal laws. that the accused is considered innocent until
proven otherwise, was known to Islam a long time ago.3o9

(4)

The principle of freedom was manifested in the most brilliant
way during the time of 'Ali (A).
Despite exceptional circumstances
(tribulation, conspiracies and wars) that could have justified
restrictions on people's freedom of movement and residence, or what

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

401

is known nowadays as martial law, 'Ali (&) did not limit the
freedom of anyone, whether they were his followers or his
opponents. He did not force anyone to stay in the area under his
authority or to leave that area. He did not force anyone to go out with
him to fight his enemies, and he did not even prevent anyone from
joining ~ u ' 2 w i ~ a hHe. ~did
~ ~ not limit the freedom of the
companions of Abdullah ibn Mas'ood, 'Ubaydah as-Salm2ni and arRabee' ibn Khaytham, and he did not force them to go out with him
to fight the people of Syria when they refused to do so; rather he
allowed them to go and guard one of the border regions as they
wished."' When the Kharijites rebelled against him after the battle of
Siffeen because of the issue of arbitration, he did not force any of
them to stay under his authority or to leave. On the contrary, he
instructed his officials not to intercept them as long as they did not
cause any mischief or violate the rights of the people.31z He said to
them: "We grant you three things; we will not prevent you from
praying in this mosque, we will not withhold your share of this fay'
(booty) as long as you are with us, and we will not fight you unless
you fight us."313

3. 'Ali's life in society and his
attention to enjoining what is good
and forbidding what is evil
3.1. His call to tawheed and combating shirk
The life of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) was
filled with the call to affirm the Oneness of Allah; teaching the people
the meaning of faith and of relying on, trusting in and fearing Allah;
teaching the people about Him (&) through His beautiful names and
sublime attributes; and combating polytheism of all kinds. He was

402

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

always teaching and educating people about the call of tawheed and
fighting polytheism, as manifested in the following ways:

3.1.1. No one should place his hopes in
anyone except his Lord, and he should
never fear anything except his sin
These are among the best, most eloquent and most perfect of
words, for hope is connected to something good, and fear is
connected to something bad. Evil only befalls a person because of his
sins, as AUah (&) says: ( ~ n whatever
d
of misfortnne befalls yon, it
is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much)
(Qur'an 42: 30). The one who has hope seeks to attajn good and ward
off evil. No one brings blessings except AUah (&), and no one wards
off calamity except AUah (&).
(And if Allah touches you with harm, there is none who can remove
it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can
(Qur'an 10: 107)
repel His Favour.)
(Whatever of mercy [i.e. of good], Allah may grant to mankind, none
can withhold it; and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it
thereafter.#
(Qur'an 35: 2)

(s),

Hope is based on trnst in Allah
and the one who puts his
trust in Allah (&) is seeking what he hopes for in terms of obtaining
benefits and warding off hanil. Trust can only be put in Allah (&), as
He says: (If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He
forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in AUah
[Alone] let believers put their trust.) (Qur'an 3: 160)
(Would that they were contented with what Allah and His Messenger
gave them and had said: 'Allah is Sufficient for us. Allah will give us
of His Bounty, and so will His Messenger [from dms]. We implore
Allah [to enrich U S ] . ' ~
(Qur'an 9: 59)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

403

$Those [i.e. believers] unto whom the people [hypocrites] said,
'Verily, the people [pagans] have gathered against you [a great
army], therefore, fear them.' But it [only] increased them in Faith,
and they said: 'Allah [Alone] is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best
Disposer of affairs [for ns].'B
(Qur'an 3: 173)
So they say: Allah (&) is sufficient for us, meaning that He is
sufficient to ward off calamity. They are commanded to say: Allah
(&) is sufficient to bring us blessings, and He is sufficient for His
slave, to protect against evil and help him to attain good. 41s Allah not
sufficient for His slave?# (Qur'an 39: 36) Whoever put his w s t and
hope in anyone other than Allah (&$) will be let down and deprived
of help.
$The likeness of those who (ake [false deities as] Awliyu' [protectors,
helpers] other than Allah is the likeness of a spider who builds [for
itselfl a house; but verily, the frailest [weakest] of houses is the
spider's house.#
(Qur'an 29: 41)
$And they have a e n [for worship] &huh [gods] besides Allah, that
they might give them honour, power and glory [and also protect them
from Allah's punishment]. Nay, but they [the so-called gods] will
deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them [on the
Day of Resurrection].#
(Qnr'an 19: 81-82)
B ~ n whoever
d
assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from
the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him
to a far off place.#
(Qur'an 22: 31)
dSet not up with Allah any other il2h [god], [0man]! F i s verse is
addressed to Prophet Muhammad, but its implication is general to all
mankind], or you will sit down reproved, forsaken [in the hellfire].#
(Qur'an 17: 22)

(You worship besides Allah only idols, and you only invent
falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allah have no

404

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflife

power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allah
[Alone], and worship Him [Alone], and be grateful to Him. To Him
[Alone] you will be brought back.)
(Qur'an 29: 17)
Whoever strives for the sake of anything other than Allah (&),
hoping to benefit from that for which he is striving, is a loser. Allah
( B )says: BAS for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a
mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until be
comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing; but he finds Allah with him,
Who will pay him his due bell]. And Allah is Swift in taking
account.) (Qur'an 24: 39)
4The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their
works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy
day; they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned.)
(Qur'an 14: 18)

(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they [disbelievers, polytheists,
sinners] did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating
particles of dust.)
(Qur'an 25: 23)
4Everything will perish save His Face.%

(Qur'an 28: 88)

As it was said in the commentary on these verses: All action is
in vain except that by means of which His countenance is sought.
When anyone strives for anything but Allah (&) and puts his hope in
that, this effort is in vain. The one who is hoping sometimes seeks by
means of his actions the pleasure of the one in whom he has placed
his hope, and sometimes he relies on him in his heart and tnrns to him
and asks him for help to achieve it; that is a kind of worship of him
and a kind of seeking his help, and Allah
says: dYou [Alone] we
worship, and You [Alone] we ask for help [for each and everything].)

(s)

(Qur'an 1: 5)
(SO

worship Him [O Muhammad] and put your trust in Him.)
(Qur'an 11: 123)

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

405

(iSay: 'He is my Lord! Lri il2ha ill6 Huwa [none has the right to be
worshipped but He]! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return
with repentance.'b
(Qur'an 13: 30)
To explain further: Whatever good a person attains is from
Allah, and whatever misfortunes are warded off from him or he is
granted relief from, it is Allah Who prevented it, and it is AUah Who
granted him relief. Whatever actions or means led to that were
created by Him. AUah is the Creator of all means, whether the means
are the action of a living being done by choice and intentionally, as
Allah may create the cause by the action of the angels, jinn, humans
or animals, or by the actions of inanimate objects because of what
Allah (&) has created in them of nature or inclinations, or by means
of forces that are under His control, such as wind, water and so on.
Allah
is the Creator of all that, and there is no power and no
strength except in ~ i r n . Whatever
~'~
He wills happens, and whatever
He does not will does not happen. All hope and trust must be placed
in the Lord, and all supplication must be directed to Him. E H e wills
something and makes it easy, it will happen and will be easy, even if
people do not want it. But if He does not will it and does not make it
easy, it will not happen, even if people want it.315These are some of
the meanings of the words of Arnir al-Mu'mineen: "No one should
place his hopes in anyone except his ~ o r d . " ~ ' ~

(s)

As for his words, "And he should never fear anything except
his sin,>317, Allah (s)
says: #But whenever good came to them, they
said: 'Ours is this.' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil
omens connected with Moosa [Moses] and those with him), (Qnr'an
7: 131). So Allah (&)tells us that good fortune comes from Him, and
He blesses people with it, hut misfortune only befalls them because
of their sin. Hence Allah (g)
says: (And Allah would not punish
them while you [Muhammad] are amongst them, nor will He punish
them while they seek [Allah's] forgiveness.) (Qur'an 8: 33)

406

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of l$e

He is telling us that He does not punish the one who asks for
forgiveness, because asking for forgiveness erases the sin that is the
cause of punishment. Thus punishment is warded off, as the Prophet
told us: "Whoever persists in asking for forgiveness, Allah (&)
will grant him relief from every wony and a way out from every
hardship, and He (g)
will grant him provision from (sources) he
could never imagine."318 AUah ($g) says:

(s)

B[Saying] worship none hut Allah. Verily, I [Muhammad] am unto
you from Him a wamer and a bringer of glad tidings. And
[commanding you]: 'Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and hun to
Him in repentance, that Hemay grant you good enjoyment, for a term
appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace
[i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving,
physically and with his wealth, and even with good words1.b
(Qur'an 11: 2-3)

Here Allah (s)
tells us that the one who affinns His Oneness
and seeks His forgiveness will be granted good enjoyment for a term
appointed, and whoever does good after that will receive His
abounding grace. According to the hadith, Satan said: "I cause doom
to people by means of sins, and they cause my doom by means of Lci
ikiha illa Allih (saying that none has the right to be worshipped but
Allah) and asking for forgiveness.319 When I saw that, I tried to
misguide them on the basis of whims and desires, so that they would
sin and not repent, because they think that they are doing well."320
'Umar ibn 'Abdnl-'Azeez said: "There is no calamity that occurred
except because of sin, and there is no calamity that was relieved
except because of repentance." Hence AUah
says:

(s)

(Those [i.e. believers] unto whom the people [hypocrites] said,
'Verily, the people [pagans] have gathered against you [a great
army], therefore, fear them.' But it [only] increased them in Faith,
and they said: 'Allah [Alone] is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

407

Disposer of affairs [for us].' So they returned with grace and bounty
from Allah. No harm touched them; and they followed the good
Pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty. It is only
Satan that suggests to you the fear of his Awliy? [supporters and
friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His
Messenger, Muhammad)]; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are
[true] believers.)
(Qur'an 3: 173.175)
So AUah ( g ) told the believers not to fear the friends of Satan,
and He commanded them to fear Him. Fear of Him dictates doing
that which He enjoins, refraining from doing that which He forbids,
and asking Him for forgiveness for sins. Then calamity will be
warded off, and victory against enemies will be granted. Hence Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "No one should fear anything but his
sin.,>3Zl I£ someone gains power over him, it is only because of his
sins, so let him fear Allah (&) and repent from the sins that caused
whatever befell him.322AS it says in the report: "Allah
says: 'I
am Allah, the King of Kings; the hearts and forelocks of the kings are
in My hand. Whoever obeys Me, I will make them (kings) merciful to
him, and whoever disobeys Me, I will make them a source of
vengeance against him. So do not be distracted by reviling kings.
Obey Me, and I will soften their hearts towards

3.1.2. Amir al-Mu'mineen taught the people
the names and attributes of Allah (%)
Allah (&) says: #So know [O Muhammad] that Lni iliha illa
Allah [none has the right to he worshipped but Allah], and ask
forgiveness for your sin) (Qur'an 47: 19). The one who has more
knowledge of Allah ( g ) will fear Him more, as AUah (&) says: dIt
is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah)
(Qur'an 35: 28). So the noble Qur'an states that knowledge of the
beautiful names and sublime attributes of Allah is one of the greatest

408

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way o f life

means of increasing and strengthening faith and making it steadfast.
Knowledge of Allah ( B )includes the three types of tawheed: the
tawheed of His Lordship, the tawheed of directing acts of worship to
Him alone, and the tawheed of His names and attributes. These three
types are the essence, foundation and aim of faith. The more one
knows the names and attributes of AUah (s),
the more one's faith
grows and increases in certainty.324AUah ( B )says: (And [all] the
Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and
leave the company of those who belie or deny [or utter impious
speech against] His Names. They will be requited for what they used
to do) (Qur'an 7: 180). (Say [O Muhammad]: 'Invoke Allah [or
invoke the Most Gracious (Allah)], by whatever name you invoke
Him [it is the same], for to Him belong the Best Names') (Qur'an 17:
110). And it is proven in Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (@J
said: "Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Whoever
learns them by heart will enter paradise."325h other words, whoever
memorises them, understands their meanings, believes in them and
worships Allah (g)
with them will enter paradise, and no one will
enter paradise except the believers.326
Because of the importance of this knowledge, Amir d Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "0 seeker of knowledge, there are three
signs of the knowledgeable person: knowledge of Allah, knowledge
of what AUah loves, and knowledge of what Allah hates."327He also
said, describing Allah (&): "He has knowledge of every place, of
every moment in time. He did not create things from raw material;
neither did He create things from something that already existed.
Rather He created what He created in a perfect manner and gave it
shape and shaped it perfectly. He is One in His supremacy, and
nothing is beyond His control. He does not benefit from acts of
obedience on the part of His creation. He responds quickly to those
who call upon Him. The angels in heaven and on earth obey Him. His
knowledge of those who are long dead is l i e His knowledge of those

'Ali ibn Abi T&b

409

who are still living. His knowledge of what is in the highest heaven is
like his knowledge of what is in the deepest earth. His knowledge
encompasses all things, and He does not become confused by the
multitude of voices and languages. He is the Al-Seeing Controller,
the Knower of all things, the Ever Living, Self Sustaining. Glory be
to Him, and exalted be He far above his athibutes being likened to
human attributes."328
A Jew came to Ax~liral-Mu'nlineen 'ALi ibn Abi TSib (&)
and asked him: "When did our Lord come into existence?" 'Ali's
face changed, and he said: "Are you saying that He did not exist, then
He existed? He existed before anything existed, and His existence
has no comparison. He exists with no beginning and no end. AU
things will end, but He is eternal, and He is the ultimate goal." The
Jewish man became ~ u s l i m . ~Among
'~
the reports that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) narrated from the Messenger of Allah (gJ
concerning the attributes of Allah (g)
was the report that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Allah is kind and loves kindness, and
He gives for kindness that which He does not give for harshness."330
Knowing the names and attributes of AUah (B),
pondering
their meanings and believing in them generates love of Allah (g)
and veneration of Him. This, in turn, motivates one to heed His
commands and prohibitions, to tum to Him in times of calamity, to
ask of Him in times of need, to seek His help in times of hardship,
and to perfonn other kinds of worship that are rooted in the heart."'

3.1.3. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)
taught the people about the blessings of Allah ( B )
for which they should give thanks
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T s i b (A)said, reminding
the people of Allah and His blessings to His slaves: "I exhort you, 0
slaves of Allah, to fear AUah (&) Who set out parables for you, set a

time for you on earth, gave you hearing to understand what you need
to understand, gave you sight to see the things around you, and gave
you hearts and minds to understand things, in a body to which He
gave shape and function. For Allah (s)
did not create you in vain,
and He did not forsake you; rather He honoured you with a great deal
of blessings and granted you a great deal from His generosity. He has
encompassed you with His knowledge and has promised you reward
for times of ease and hardship. So fear Allah, 0 slaves of Allah (&),
and strive hard in seeking Him. Hasten to do good deeds before
death, the destroyer of pleasures, approaches."332
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ih (&) used to urge the
people to draw close to Allah ( B )by giving thanks for the blessings
that they had, and he used to warn them against being content with
that and feeling secure with it. He encouraged them to seek what is
with Allah ( B )of more blessings by giving thanks for blessings. as
he said: "If you are blessed with a time of ease, then give thanks to
Allah and combine that with fear of Him. If hardship befalls you,
remember Allah and combine that with hope in Him, for Allah grants
to the Muslims a goodly reward, but He gives more to those who give
thanks."333 Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (4)
called the
people to evaluate themselves, and he said: "The one who knows

'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said: "The Messenger of Allah (@,)
was at a funeral, and he said: 'Which of you will go to o ad in ah^^^
and not leave any idol without breaking it, or any grave without

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

So he set out, then he came back and said: '0 Messenger of Allah, I
did not leave any idol but I broke it, and I did not leave any grave but
I levelled it, and I did not leave any image but I erased it.' The
Messenger of Allah
said: 'Whoever goes back to any of these
things has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad

(%.,,,,336

When he became caliph, 'Ali (&) sent Abu d-Hayij d-Asadi
and said to him: "I am sending you on the same mission as the
Messenger of Allah (g)
sent me. Do not leave any image without
destroying it, or any raised grave without levelling it."337 He told
him that images should be erased and that the graves should be level
with the ground, with no raised features.

Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) would often go to the
graveyard to visit it and to seek a lesson therefrom. He looked out
over the graveyard and said: "0 people of the graves, tell us your
news. As for our news, the women have gotten married, the wealth
has been divided, and the houses are inhabited by people other than
you." Then he said: "If they could speak, they would say: 'We do not
think there is anything better than piety."'338 Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) used to strive hard to purify his tawheed, and he blocked by
all means any practices that might lead to idolatry. Hence he warned
against taking graves as places of worship, because of the trouble that
might cause to the occupants of the graves and because it is a means
that leads to worship of the dead. He said: 'The most evil of people
are those who take graves as places of
By his words and
actions, he was following the words of the Messenger of Allah (g):
"The wrath of AUah is very great against people who took the graves
of their Prophets as places of
There are other sound
hadiths about this topic, too.
It is essential to note that the purpose of visiting the graves is to
achieve two things, as is clear from the Prophet's teachings: one is to

412

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

seek a lesson from death, and the other is to pray for the deceased and
to ask for mercy for them. There is nothing in any of these reports to
indicate that the visitor should go to the grave for the purpose of
seeking to have his needs met. Going to the grave in order to benefit
from it is contrary to the teaching of the Prophet (g),
and it is
contraq to the etiquette of visiting the graves, as stated by the
scholars.341
Ibn alL'Arabi made a list of the aims of travel, and this included
travelling to see one's brothers to check on their situation. After
mentioning the virtue of the one who visits a brother for the sake of
Allah (&), he said: "This applies if he is alive. If he is dead, it is
permissible to visit his grave too, and to pray for mercy for him, so
that the deceased may benefit from the living. But he should not seek
to benefit from the deceased, because this is an innovation."342
In fact, going to graves in the hopes of having one's needs met
is exactly like what the Prophet (g)
warned his Companions against
when they asked him to make them a tree that would bring blessings.
According to the hadith of Abu W2qid al-Laythi, when the
Messenger of Allah (g)
set out for Hunayn, he passed by a tree of
the idol-worshippers that was called Dh2t AnwLif, on which they
would hang their weapons (for blessing). They said: "0 Messenger of
Allah (@), make for us a Dh2t Anwit like they have." The Prophet
(g)
said: "Glory to Allah! This is just like what was said to Moosa,
'Make us a god like they have.' By the One in Whose hand is my
soul, you will follow the way of those who came before
In 'Iddat al-Mureed, Shaykh az-Zarooq quotes the hadich
mentioned above and says: "According to the scholars, it is not
permissible to venerate a place, tree, building or anything else that
has a basis in the beliefs of pre-Islamic ignorance, in hope of being
healed or having one's needs met."344 Then he said: ''In the hadith,
there is evidence that everything that perpetuates or has an origin in

j

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

413

pre-Islamic idol worship, such as wood, iron, stone, structures and so
on, is forbidden if it cannot be put to any mundane
Undoubtedly, veneration of graves has its origin in the
worship from the time of spritual darkness before Islam; in fact it is
the root thereof. Nothing is more indicative of that than the fact that
the most famous of the idols that they worshipped instead of Allah
(&)were al-Lit and Manit. These were the names of righteous men,
but after they died, the people exaggerated in their veneration of them
until they began to worship them instead of Allah (&).346 Here the
and the actions of 'ALi (&) played a
hadith of the Prophet (g)
critical role in protecting the concept of tawheed. It becomes clear to
us that what some ignorant Muslims do, such as venerating graves,
circumambulatingthem, and becoming attached to their occupants, is
something harim that is contrary to the commands of Allah (&) and
the attitude and actions of Amir al-Mu'mineen. The devoted scholars
who put their hope in Allah ( B )and the Last Day must follow the
example of the Prophet (g),
as Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did.
They must strive to teach the people to worship the Lord alone and
make their hearts attached to Allah
the One, the Subduer. They
must conquer, with wisdom and beautiful preaching, the obstacles
that bar the way to Allah.

3.1.4.a. The prescribed manner of visiting graves
There is a prescribed manner of visiting graves, but many
people are unaware of it. This is due to the prevalence of innovations
and myths in the Muslim world and the lack of guidance from
scholars and callers to Islam concerning the prescribed manner of
visiting graves and what should he said when visiting them. The aims
are to he reminded of death, the true status of man and what his end
will be, and to remember that there will come a day when this place,
which he is visiting today, will be his resting place. This will help to
make the people steadfast in obeying Allah (&), and it will

414

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

(s),

encourage them to push themselves to worship Allah
especially
if they are lazy and unwilling to worship. Greeting the dead, and
praying for mercy and forgiveness for them, is also prescribed.
Among the evidence concerning that is the hadith of 'kishah (I&,),
who said: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
used to go out at the endof
the night to Baqee' Cemetery and say: 'Peace be upon you, 0 abode
of believing people, and we - if Allah wills - will join yon. 0
Allah (%), forgive the people of Baqee' Cemetery."' According to
another report from her (@), Jibreel came to the Prophet (SJand
told him that Allah was c o k d i n g him to pray for forgiveness for
the people of Baqee' Cemetery. '2ishah (I&) said: "What should I
say to them, 0 Messenger of Allah ( g ) ? " ~e said: "Say: 'Peace be
upon the people of these abodes, believers and Muslims. May AUah
have mercy on those of us who have gone on before and those who
come later, and we will - if Allah wills - join you. r 1,347
3.1.4.b. The beginning of celebrations of visits to tombs
It is said that the first ones to introduce the celebration of
annual visits to tombs were the Fatimids in the fourth century AH.
Al-Maqreezi Alpnad ibn 'Ali said: "They had six birthdays: the
birthday of the Prophet ( g ) ; the birthdays of 'Ali ihn Abi Tsib, alHasan, al-Husayn and Fztimah (may Allah be pleased with them),
and the birthday of the caliph. They used to offer sacrifices of camels,
cattle and sheep at the tomb of a l - ~ n s a ~ n . " ~ ~ ~
Before this time, during the first three centuries, the Muslims
did not build tombs or hold celebrations around them. In fact, most of
the Companions (may Allah he pleased with them) were buried
outside Baqee' Cemetery, in Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and the locations
of their graves are not even known. In cases where the grave is said to
he known, the historians and writers of biographies differed
concerning it. How could their burial places be unknown to the
writers of their biographies when they were righteous scholars and

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

415

beacons of guidance, individuals who canied the banner of Islam,
knowledge, jihad and worship? If it had been the custom to build up
tombs at the time of the Companions and the Tibi'oon, then their
locations could not have been hidden. They would have been known
at that time and in later times, and the historians would not have
differed as to whether a specific grave was that of a certain
Companion or not. The fact that people after the earliest generations
performed these actions does not give them any legitimacy at all.
How could it, when the Prophet (g)
had forbidden taking his grave
as a place of gathering? Those who do that are in fact doing exactly
what the Prophet (&) forbade, quoting their own actions and the
actions of their shaykhs as evidence and giving that precedence over
the teaching of the Messenger of Allah (gg)and his Companions. But
Allah (&) says: 4 0 you who believe! Do not put [yourselves]
forward before Allah and His Messenger.), (Qur'an 49: 1)
(And let those who oppose the Messenger's [Muhammad]
commandment [i.e., his Sunnah - legal ways, orders, acts of
worship, statement, etc.] [among the sects] beware lest some Fitnah
[disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a
tyrant, etc.] befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.),
(Qur'an 24: 63)

3.1.4.c. Connection between shrines and
backwardness and ignorance
Placing importance on building domes and tombs is contrary
to the command of the Messenger of Allah
to level them, as
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) explained to us. The
people used their talents to decorate them with bright colours; they
were adorned with s i k covers like the covers of the Ka'bah and were
guarded with splendid gates. There were heavy iron boxes to collect
money from visitors, who paid for vows made to the occupants of the
tombs so that their needs might he met and their hopes fulfilled.

(s)

416

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Some people prospered from serving and guarding tombs, and these
people narrated stories of miracles, as well as warnings of bad
consequences for anyone who shed doubts on the soundness of what
was taking place.
It is well known that venerating tombs in this manner is
something that did not flourish until the Muslims became backward
and grew weak, in the eras of intellectual decline and stagnation. By
then, the light of Muhammad's (@) message, which in its first forty
years had managed to spread from Persia to Morocco and had called
for the building of a noble civilisation, had tumed into apathy,
idleness, laziness and pinning hopes on illusions. The Muslims
Limited their efforts to practices that our righteous predecessors, who
filled this world with knowledge and righteous deeds, would not
even discuss or pay any attention to. Does it not behoove us to ask
ourselves: at the time of the Companions, did they do anything of that
nature to the grave of the Messenger of Allah (g),
which is the best
grave on the face of the earth. or to any of their graves, when they are
the best of the Ummah? Did anything like that happen even at the
time of the imams whose example is to be followed, such as M m
ash-Shsa'i, Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on
them?
None of these things happened at their time. Isn't that an
indication that what is going on has no basis in Islam or in worship or
in the concept of the wali (close friend of Allah)? Rather this is a
manifestation of backwardness and ignorance, which was exploited
by those who have an interest to achieve in the name of religion,
regardless of what that interest may be. Their goals are to numb the
public, to gain control of their minds and pockets, to consume their
wealth and to pull them backwards. For many centuries, the Islamic
nation led the world in power, kao~.!dge, civi!inyation, !egislation,
morality, compassion for humanity, invention and other sublime

'Ali ibn Abi Tlilib

41 7

matters. That was how the Muslims were when they were following
true Islam. Then they turned away from that and adopted
misconceptions based on fatalism, idleness, apathy and attachment to
metaphysical matters that have no basis in Sharia and that AUah
did not enjoin. What they had of howledge and guidance was
replaced by these fallacies, which were called blessings, although
they were actually the exact opposite. The ones who turned away
from guidance and means of guidance became the misguided and the
furthest away from blessing.349

(s)

3.1.4.d. Colonialism and the establishment of tombs
The Western colonialist campaigns played a role in
encouraging the Muslims to follow this path so that they would be far
away from the essence of Islam. The English newspaper The Times
quoted the words of one of the British colonialists who encouraged
innovation and myths among the Muslims: "This guarantees to keep
them away from Islam. Shaykh &mad al-Baqoori said that one of
the senior Orientalists told him about some of the methods of
colonialism in Asia, and that it was essential to change the routes of
the caravans coming from India to Baghdad through that vast area to
new routes that served the interests of the colonialists. They could not
find any method to make the caravans choose that new route until
finally they were guided to establish tombs and shrines at short
intervals along that route. Soon the people started to transmit
rnmours about the 'saints' to be found on that route and what they
had seen of their miracles, whereupon this route became very
popular."350
The British government paid attention to the religious situation
in Egypt and was watching the communist movement in the area.
One of the things that confirmed the religious commitment of the
Egyptians was that three million Muslims visited the tomb of &mad
al-Badawi in Tanta in one year. One of the scholars who was sent

418

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

from the AwqZ Ministry to exhort them said: "I have seen, of their
actions, things that require lashes with the whip, not just verbal
rebukes. If they were called to a valid religious duty, they would be
reluctant to do it and would run away. It is sufficient to know about
their situation that they come to the tomb mentioned to fulfil vows
and offer

creation to Allah (&) and the one who feared Allah ( B )the most.
The respect that the Companions had for him is no secret, and their
love for him is beyond estimation. He (g)
was buried in his house,
and the site of his grave was known to his Companions. Although it
is the best grave in this world, they did not build a shrine or structure
or dome over it. Neither the Rightly Guided Caliphs nor any of his
other Companions gathered at his grave to commemorate him on any
particular day of the year for the purpose of remembrance and
worship. Rather if they passed by his grave, they would send
blessings and peace upon him, as their Lord bad enjoined them to do.
They obeyed the Prophet's commands, followed his Sunnah and
guidance, and heeded his commands and prohibitions both during his
life and after his death, in obedience to the words of their Lord: (And
whatsoever the Messenger [Muhammad] gives you, take it; and
whatsoever he forbids you, abstain [from it].) (Qur'an 59: 7) and
(Indeed in the Messenger of Allah [Muhammad] you have a good
example to follow.) (Qur'an 33: 21)
The way of his successors is the best example of the way the
Messenger of All&
commanded us to follow and cling f d y to.
It is not narrated from any of the Muslims that these Companions
(may Allah he pleased with them) gathered on a specific night of the
year at his grave for remembrance and worship, hoping for his
blessings, even though they were the closest of people to Allah. They

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

419

were the guided group, the supporters of the truth and the troops of
faith, they had more knowledge than us of what the Messenger of
Allah (g)
loved, and they were more keen to obey him. The high
esteem in which they held the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the great
respect that they had for him in their hearts is no secret, and no one
disputes that. This is confirmed by the Qur'an, and all the scholars of
Islam are agreed that they honoured, loved and respected him.
If this annual gathering at his grave was something that could
bring people closer to Allah (&), and there was no fear that it might
lead to misguidance in religion, they would have been the first to do
it, but the Messenger of Allah (g)
did not command them during his
lifetime to do anything like that. There is nothing in his Sunnah, no
action and no approval, that could indicate that snch acts are
permissible at the grave of the Prophet (@Jor at the grave of any of
the Companions. Years of his life went by, and neither he nor his
Companions performed any acts of worship of that nature. He is the
best of Allah's creation in servitude and worship of Allah (&), the
most perfect in howledge of what pleases Him, the most sincere
towards his Ummah and the most keen to guide them to that which
benefits them. This is something that is confirmed in the Qur'an:
@verily,there bas come unto you a Messenger [Muhammad] from
amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury
or difficulty. He [Muhammad] is anxious over you; for the believers
[he is] full of pity, kind, and merciful.) (Qur'an 9: 128)
The Prophet (g)
., forbade us to take his grave as a place of
gathering. He said: "Do not make your houses like graves, and do not
make my grave a place of regular gathering; but send blessings upon
me, for your blessings will reach me wherever I am."352 In other
words: Do not allocate special days for visiting my grave, or special
times every month or every year and so on, for public gatherings that
are repeated in a regular manner snch as Eid; do not create rituals for

420

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way oflife

it, for which you travel like hajj; and do not imitate the Jews and
Christians, for they do that, and it has led them to exaggeration and
going to extremes in praising the deceased, to the extent that they
made the Messiah (peace be upon him) a god. The Prophet 1%)
wamed his Companions against that, saying: "Do not praise me as
the Christians praised the son of Maryam, for I am only His slave.
Say: The slave of Allah and His ~ e s s e n ~ e r . " ~ ~ ~
If this is prohibited for the grave of the Prophet (gJ- the
noblest of creation before Allah (g),
the leader of the first and the
last, the best of all creation, the one whose intercession is most hoped
for before Allah (&) on the Day of Judgement - then what about
the graves of those who are of lesser status, such as the 'saints' and
the righteous? Taking their graves as places of regular gathering is a
violation of this prohibition. It is like going against the Prophet's
command, which Allah ( B )warned about in this verse: (And let
those who oppose the Messenger's [Muhammad] commandment
[i.e., his Sunnah - legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statement,
etc.] [among the sects] beware lest some Fimah [disbelief, trials,
afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.] befall
them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.) (Qur'an 24: 63)
This is the way of the best of generations. The one who goes
against them, thinking that he is doing acts of worship and drawing
close to Allah (B),is doing one of two things: either he is
introducing innovation wrongfully, or he is claiming that he has
surpassed them in virtue and knowledge. Imam M2lik (may Allah
have mercy on him) used to say: "Whoever introduces anything to
this Ummah that its early generations did not do is claiming that the
Messenger of AUah (g)
betrayed the religion, because Allah (&)
says: (This day, I have perfected your religion for YOU.) (Qur'an 5: 3)
So whatever was not part of the religion of Islam then cannot he part
of the religion of Islam today."354 He also used to say: "And the

Sunnah is like Nooh's ark: whoever embarks on it will be saved, and
whoever stays behind will
Establishing shrines as an act of worship is something that was
not done by the Messenger of Allah (g)
or his Companions. He
forbade that, and going against him is introducing innovations to the
religion that will lead to misguidance. In every Friday sermon, the
Prophet (@) gave the waming: "The best of speech is the Book of
Allah (&),and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad;
the worst of matters are those which are newly invented, and evely
innovation is going astray."356 He also (g)
said: "Whoever
introduces something into this matter of ours that is not part of it will
have it rejected."357
Gathering the people for the purpose of worship on a specific
day and on a regular basis, in a place to which they travel from all
over, is only permissible in cases prescribed by Allah
These
include the established rituals of pilgrimages in Makkah, 'Arafah,
Mina and Muzdalifah; the prayers on Eid and Friday; and prayers in
congregation. These are the symbols which Allah (%)enjoined to be
venerated and established, and He praised those who do that, saying:
#Thus it is an obligation that mankind owes to Allab. And whosoever
honours the symbols of Allah, then it is truly from the piety of the
heart.) (Qur'an 22: 32)

(s).

Introducing events and locations other than those that have
been mentioned, on any day of the year, is an innovation in religion,
because it is introducing acts of worship and rituals that are not
prescribed by Allah (B).Among the common folk, these shrines
have become like hajj; they gather at these places on a certain day of
the year to offer sacrifices and perform acts of worship, and they
travel for that purpose. This in and of itself is a blameworthy action,
because these are general acts of worship that are good to do at all
times and in all places. If a certain night or day or place is specified

422

The oath of allegiance to 'A& his characteristics & his way of life

for it, which has no basis in Islam, and it is believed that doing it at
that time or in that place has a special effect in attaining blessings or
raising one's status or causing deeds to be accepted or maximising
the reward, then these actions, which are originally prescribed kinds
of worship, turn into innovations according to scholarly consensus,
because the amount of reward that is connected to actions is
something that can only be known from the texts of Sbaria.
This has led to a great deal of conuption in the beliefs of the
common folk about the occupants of the graves over which domes
have been built, contrary to the prohibition of the Messenger of Allah
(B),Some believe that they have the power to cause harm, bring
benefit and meet needs, so they seek to draw close to them by visiting
the shrine on a certain day of the year and offering a sacrifice there.
The idea was propagated that whoever brings an animal to the shrine
to be slaughtered there at that time bas the hope that his Lord will
grant him what he needs, and that he will not go back without having
that need met. These shrines became a focal point for people with
needs, such as a childless person asking for a child or a sick person
asking to be healed. They began to ask of them what a person should
ask of his Lord. They sought help from them and thought that their
needs would be met by their Lord because of their intercession and
through them. They began to offer sacrifices at these shrines to bring
rain if it was delayed, turning away from the Book of Allah (&)and
the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (@), who enjoined
repentance, seeking forgiveness, supplication and a special prayer
asking for rain. Rain may fall after they offer their sacrifice, as a
further test and to let them get carried away in their misguidance, but
nevertheless their action remains the work of the devils and beliefs of
pre-Islamic ignorance.358It is only to Allah
that we complain.

him and follow him should follow his words and actions, which
instruct us to adhere to the Holy Qur'an and the guidance of the
Prophet (g).
How good are his words: "No person should hope in
anyone but his Lord, and he should not fear anything but his sin."359
He said to Abn al-Haygj d-Asadi: "Shall I not send you on the same

sent me? Do not leave any
image without erasing it, or any raised grave without levelling it."360

3.1.6.f. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a i b (&)
was keen to demonstrate that belief in the stars is false
When Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) wanted to
travel to fight the Kharijites, an astrologer came up to him and said:
"0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, do not travel, for the moon isin Scorpio, and
if you travel when the moon is in Scorpio, you will be defeated," or
words to that effect. 'Ali (&) said: "Rather I will travel, putting my
faith and trust in AUah, to prove that you are lying." He travelled and
was blessed in that journey, and he defeated the Kharijite~.~~'
According to another report, when he had finished fighting in
Nabrawin, he praised and glorified AUah (B),
then he said: "Had we
marched at the time suggested by the astrologer, the ignorant who do
not know would have said: 'He marched at the time that the
astrologer told him, and that is why he prevailed."'36z
Look at how keen Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was to
ensure that his companions' belief was free from the corrupt claims
of the astrologer. 'Ali(&), even though he was engaged in the
important issue of fighting the Kharijites and was preoccupied with
the outcome of the battle, did not forget what that astrologer had said
to him at the beginning of his journey. He highlighted the corrupt
nature of that belief at the appropriate time, after his battle with the
Kharijites had ended and he had prevailed over them.363

3.1.4.g. How faith begins in the heart, according to
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&),
and his definition of piety
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) said: "Faith
begins as a small white spot in the heart, and the more a person
increases in faith, the whiter his heart becomes. But the more a person
increases in hypocrisy, the blacker his heart becomes until, when the
person becomes a complete hypocrite, his heart becomes black. By
Allah, if you were to open the heart of the believer, you would find it
to be white, and if you were to open the heart of the hypocrite and the
disbeliever, yon would find it to be
The Sunni scholars have explained the real nature of faith.
They said that faith is belief in the heart, uttering the twin declaration
of faith, doing righteous deeds and carrying out obligations. In other
words, it is belief, words and actions. These three all come under the
heading of faith and represent parts of its essence. There are many
comments of the scholars and those who came after them about this
fact, and they quoted as evidence a great deat from the Qur'an and
hadith to demonstrate the soundness of this view on the reality of
faith.365Allah
says:

(s)

(The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a
fear in their hearts and when His Verses [this Qur'an] are recited unto
them, they [i.e. the Verses] increase their Faith, and they put their
trust in their Lord [Alone]; Who perform as-Sala [Zqhmat-as-Suliih]
and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the
believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and
forgiveness and a generous provision
(Qur'an 8: 2 4 )
These verses, which discuss the attributes of the believers,
combine actions of the heart and actions of physical faculties. All of
that is regarded as faith, and faith is limited to that, which is why it
says 'only' (innuma). It defines the believers as having these

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

425

attributes combined, when it says at the end, "It is they who are the
believers in buth." The physical actions referred to here are
establishing prayer and spending for the sake of Allah (3g).366
The Messenger of Allah (B)said: "Faith has seventy-odd
branches; the best of them is saying La^ ilriha illa-Allih (none has the
right to be worshipped but Allah), and the least of them is removing a
harmful thing from the road. And modesty is one of the branches of
faith,n367
Saying Lci iliha illa-Allrih refers to words, removing a
harmful thing from the road is an action, and modesty is an attitude
and behaviour. Making each of these three a part of faith is iudicative
of the essence of faith, and most of the branches of faith are physical
deeds.368Imam Bukhari said in his Saheeh: "It is words and deeds,
and it increases and decreases. Loving and hating for the sake of
Allah are part of faith." 'Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez said: "Faith
contains obligations, prescriptions, limits and sunnahs. Whoever
acquires all of them has acquired perfect faith, and whoever does not
acquire all of them has not acquired perfect faith. If I live, I shall
explain it to you so that you might act upon it, but if I die, then I am
not eager to stay with
When Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was asked about faith, be
said: "Faith is based on four pillars: patience, certainty, justice and
striving. Patience is based on four things: longing, fear, asceticism
and expecting death. The one who longs for paradise will he able to
turn away from physical desires, the one who fears hellfire will avoid
h a r h things, the one who bas no interest in worldly gains will not be
distressed by calamities, and the one who expects death will hasten to
do good things. Certainty is based on four things: deep insight,
wisdom, leaming lessons from others and the ways of those who
came before. Whoever has deep insight will have wisdom, and
whoever has wisdom will learn the lesson; the one who learns the
lesson will be as if he was among those who came before. Justice is

426

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of life

based on four things: deep understanding, deep knowledge, proper
judgement and patient forbearance. Whoever understands will gain
deep knowledge, whoever gains deep knowledge will have proper
judgement, and whoever has forbearance will not go to extremes and
will be well liked by people. Striving is based on four things:
enjoining what is good, forbidding what is evil, taking a sincere
stance in different situations and resenting evildoers. The one who
enjoins what is good will support the believers; the one who forbids
what is evil will annoy the hypocrites; the one who takes a sincere
stance in all situations has done what is required of him; and the one
who resents the evildoers and gets angry for the sake of Allah, Allah
will get angry for his sake and will make him content on the Day of
~esnrrection."~~~
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi ibn Abi T2ib (&) said, defining
piety: "(It is) refraining from persisting in sin and refraining from
relying too much on obedience."371He also said: "Piety is fear of the
Most Majestic, acting in accordance with the revelation, being
content with little and preparing for the day of departure (death)."372
'Ali's concern for urging people to be pious bore fruit on both the
individual and social levels. For example:
Allah will love a person: (Surely, Allah loves al-Muttaqoon
[the plous].b (Qur'an 9: 4 )
Allah will be with him: (Truly, Allah is with those who fear
Him [keep their duty unto Him], and those who are M&sinCn [gooddoers1.b (Qur'an 16: 128)

He will benefit from the Qur'an: $This is the Book [the
Qur'an], whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are alMuttaqoon [the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear
Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He
has forbidden) and love Allah much b e d o m all kinds of good deeds
which He bas ordained)].$ (Qur'an 2: 2 )

3.1.4.h. The divine will a n d decree, as understood
by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi ?;lib (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) said: "Nothing

does not have two angels appointed to defend him and take care of
himuntil the time comes for what Allah has decreed, whereupon they

protection will be taken away. No one knows true faith until he
realises that what befalls him could never have missed him, and what
misses him could never have befallen him."374
He (&) also said: "The divine decree comes down from

family or his wealth. If a person sees that he has some decrease with
regard to himself or his family or his wealth, and he sees that others
have a great deal, that should not be a source of resentment for him.
The sincere Muslin1 will have one of two rewards when he prays to
Allah: either Allah will grant him wealth, and thus he will have
family and wealth, and he will still have his respected status and
religious commitment, or AUah will give him blessings in the
hereafter, and the hereafter is better and more lasting. The blessings
will he twofold: blessings in this world: wealth and piety, as well as
blessings in the hereafter: the righteous good deeds that remain. And
Allah may grant both to some people."375

3.2. The amazing sermons of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) made sure to
educate, guide and teach the people through his daily interactions
with them, especially on Fridays when the sermon from the minbar
offered an opportunity for guiding and teaching the Ummah. History
has recorded many of the sermons of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali , .,
The following is a brief look at his sermons, such as this brilliant
example, in which he said:

(A).

'This world is coming to an end and will soon bid farewell, and the
hereafter is coming and will soon begin. Today the horses are being
kept in preparation, and tomorrow will be the race. Indeed you are
living in the days of hope that will be interrnpted by death. Whoever
falls short during the days of hope before his death comes will be
doomed. Strive hard for the sake of Allah (&) in the hope of reward
as you strive hard for His sake for fear of His punishment. I have
never seen anything like paradise whose seekers could sleep, and I
have never seen anything like hell, those who fear which can sleep.
The one who does not benefit from the truth will be harmed by
falsehood, and whoever does not benefit from guidance will be led
astray by misguidance. You have been instructed to travel, and you
have been told about your provision. 0 people, this world is a
t e m p o r q convenience; the righteous and the immoral alike may
enjoy its luxuries. But the hereafter is true, and it will be ruled by a
powerful King. Satan threatens you with poverty and bids you to do
evil, but Allah (&) promises you forgiveness and bounty from Him,
and Allah (&) cares for all and knows all things. 0 people, do
righteous deeds during your lifetime, and your offspring will be taken
care of. Allah (;gi;i) has promised His paradise to those who obey
Him, and He has warned of His hell for those who disobey Him. Its
fire will never be extinguished, its prisoners will never be ransomed,

430

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

and the one who suffers therein will never be helped. Its heat is
intense, its bottom is deep and its water is a boiling fetid
If we ponder the quotation above, we will find that several
methods of impacting or moving people are represented here:
1. A sincere tone that is based on his strong conviction of what he
is calling for, which makes it seem as if his words are taken from
his burning soul and warm emotions. As soon as be utters a
sentence, their ears will receive it and their hearts will
understand it.

2. Words that are powerful yet easy and sweet; the way they are put
together is clear, and the sentences are short. This may help the
listener to understand the intended meaning.

3.

Mentioning opposite meanings, which makes the meaning
clearer and will have a great impact on the listener. For example,
''This world is coming to an end and will soon bid farewell, and
the hereafter is coming and will soon begin," and "I have never
seen anything like paradise whose seekers could sleep and I have
never seen anything like hell, those who fear which can sleep."

4.

Refemng to the Holy Qnr'an, as in the words, "Satan threatens
you with poverty and bids you to do evil, but Allah promises you
forgiveness and bounty from Him, and Allah cares for all and
knows all things."378 This is based on the verse: (Satan threatens
yon with poverty and orders you to commit Fahsha [evil deeds,
illegal sexual intercourse, sins]; whereas Allah promises you
forgiveness from Himself and bounty, and Allah is AllSufficient for His creatures' needs, ~ l l - ~ n o w e r(Qur'an
.)
2: 268)

5. The ideas in this sermon are strongly influenced by the Holy
Qur'an and the words of the Messenger (g),
and they are
strongly connected to human life, with deep, sublime and
comprehensive meanings. He excelled in choosing words and

'Ali ibn Abi Tirlib

431

putting sentences together, speaking briefly and using images to
express meaning. In conclusion, this speech has a special
importance because of what it contains of religious, literary and
personal references. It represents a powerful indication of the
character of its author, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi mib
(&I. It tells of his sound understanding of Islamic concepts that
deal with the nature of this world, the goal of human existence
and the ultimate destination of humanity. This speech explains
the conclusions that Amir al-Mu'miueen 'Ali ibn Ahi T2ib
(&) reached concerning that, and it tells us of the deep insight
that he had. This is supported by his clarity of mind and purity of
heart, in addition to other sublime spiritual and intellectual
qualities that were granted to him as a result of his piety, his
adherence to the teachings of Islam, his relying on his Lord and
his feeling content with His decree. All of that helped him to
attain this high literaq level in this piece of prose. Thus in the
field of literature, he was indeed a knight of the word and a
leader of literary expression, as he was a just and ascetic leader, a
wise and experienced rnler, and a knight whom no one could
resist.379
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
,.
paid attention to making use of
different occasions to exhort and remind the people; he did not limit it
to Friday sermons only. When he walked with the funeral procession
and heard the voices of the bereaved family raised in weeping as the
body was placed in the niche in the grave, he would say: "Why are
you weeping? By Allah, if they could see what your deceased one is
seeing, they would be distracted from their deceased one by what
they see. Death will come back again and again, until none of them is
left. So fear Allah, 0 slaves of Allah, and strive hard in righteous
deeds. Hasten to do good deeds before death, the destroyer of
pleasures, comes. The pleasures of this world will not last, and you
cannot feel secure against the calamities of this world, for it is

I

fleeting and deceitful and cannot be relied on. Learn the lessons, 0
slaves of Allah, and heed the exhortation, for soon you will die and
will be buried. Soon the Tnunpet will be blown, and the occupants of
the graves will be raised and driven to the arena of gathering for the
Reckoning. Everything is under the control of the Almighty. Every
person will have an angel to drive him and an angel to bear witness to
his deeds. $And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord [Allah],
when He will come to judge among men, and the Book will he placed
[open], and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward,
and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be
wronged.) (Qur'an 39: 69) "
From this exhortation, we notice the following ways of how to
make a speech have an impact:

1. Giving the exhortation at an appropriate time. This was given on
the occasion of a funeral, when people are prepared to receive
admonitions about death and the hereafter.

2. Eloquent delivery. The words of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn
Abi T2ib (&) were distinguished by their moving style that
had an impact on the hearts of the listeners.

3.

Following the way of the Qur'an. This message was based on the
Qur'an. His words: "And every person will have an angel to
drive him and an angel to bear witness to his deeds," are based
on the words of Allah (&), dAnd every person will come forth
along with an [angel] to drive [him] and an [angel] to bear
witness.) (Qur'an 50: 21)

4.

Warning the people by mentioning the terrors of the Day of
Resurrection. He said: "For soon you will die and will be buried.
Soon the Trumpet will be blown, and the occupants of the graves
will be raised and driven to the arena of gathering for the
Reckoning. Everything is under the control of the Almighty."

Presenting a vivid image by using the past tense (in Arabic) to
describe something that is going to happen in the future, so that
the listener can imagine what is awaiting him. For example, he
said: "for soon you will die and will be buried [this appears in the
past tense in the Arabic original]."

6.

Using a gentle approach so as to attract listeners and not put
them off.380

These are a few examples of the speeches and exhortations of
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) that became widely
known among the people and played a role in educating them,
teaching them good manners and purifying their hearts. Their impact
was felt in his generation and the generations that came after him,
until the present day.

3.3. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)
and poetry
From the reports that have reached us, it seems that the poetry
movement was active at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. The
sources for information on poetry and poets at the time of Amir d Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) are the books of literary works, which are rich
in this regard. ~ l & u g h it is well known that literary works did not
rely on trnstworthy narration with regard to the way they were
transmitted, they are the main sources for information on literature
and literaq criticism having to do with the Rightly Guided Caliphs
and the Companions in general, and those who followed them in
truth. The only exceptions are some lines of verse that were recited at
the time of the Prophet (g)
and mentioned in the books of hadith.381
'Ali's attitude towards poetry was no different from that of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs who came before him. Their attitude was
based on the Book of Allah 1%) and the Sumah of His Messenger

434

R e oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

(g).
'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) would listen to poets and to what he
was asked to listen to of sincere words and sublime meanings. He
would give rewards for poetry if he liked it and was impressed with
it, as we have seen above when the Bedouin said (in verse):
You gave me a suit to wear, the beauty of which will wear out,
but I shall clothe you with many suits of praise.382

'Ali's evaluation of poetry was fine and astute. His standards of
criticismremain valid and are still referred to by critics today. He said:
"Poetry is the standard of speech."383 This means that poetry has
characteristics by means of which good wording can be distinguished
from bad according to the standards of this verbal art,even though the
values mentioned may differ from those of other people.384
With regard to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) as a poet, there
is a difference of opinion concerning most of the poetry that is
attributed to him. However, this dispute does not undermine his
position as a poet with regard to what is most likely to be his poetry,
nor does it affect his linguistic and literary pre-eminence. But it
seems to the researcher that poetry was not his main focus. Moreover,
his political career and the major events that accompanied it did not
give him the opportunity to focus on the composition and narration of
poetry, or to seek beautiful meanings and choose moving rhythms.
Nevertheless, there is a great deal of poetry that is attributed to him,
including a collection of poetry that includes a number of odes and
shoa poems, as well as some statements that were made
spontaneously and some sublime and wise opinions.
The first one who shed doubt on the attribution of some odes to
him was Ibn H i s h h , who narrated that 'Ali used to say some lines of
verse during the construction of the Prophet's Mosque in Madinah:
There's one that labours night and day,
to build us mosque of brick and clay,
and one who turns porn dust away!385

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

435

Ibn H i s h h commented: "I asked more than one of those who
have knowledge of poetry about these lines, and they said: 'We heard
that 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&) recited them."' Then he said: "It is not
known whether be was the composer or someone else."386
Elsewhere, Ibn H i s b h says: "Ibn Ish2q narrated three odes that are
attributed to 'Ali (&), but this attribution is not sound; he thinks it
most Wcely that they were composed during the Islamic battles by
one of the Muslims. They examined the religious meanings, and the
narrator thought that it was befitting to attribute it to 'Ali, so they did
so." As for the collection of poems that is attributed to him, Dr. N2yif
Ma'roof thinks that Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
is known for his
eloquence, and his eloquence is of a higher standard than that which
is found in this collection. It seems most likely that what is mentioned
in the collection comes from different poets of varying standards of
poetry, and that it was compiled by some of those who loved 'ALi
(&) and found it hard to accept that he was not a poet, thinking that
this would raise him in status with people. However, it may be noted
that 'Ali (&) was not one of the poets of the Messenger, whose role
was to respond to the propaganda attacks launched by the polytheist
poets against Islam and the ~ u s l i m s . ~
There
~ ' is no poetry that can
be soundly attributed to 'Ali except two lines.388There are many
reports that are contrary to this suggestion, and the narrators
confirmed many uses of verse which may soundly be attributed to
him in their view.389

3.4. Wise sayings of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) which became widely
circulated among the people
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) had many
qualities such as cleverness, eloquence, wisdom, purity of heart and
soul, deep faith, profound understanding and closeness to the

436

The oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way of lifc

Messenger of Allah (@). He learned the Revelation from him, which
enabled him to speak eloquently and explain clearly. Still, his words
were like pearls, and his statements became sayings that impressed
people of wisdom. Thus they set standards for people of a literruy
bent and seekers of guidance. In his words there was motivation for
them to do righteous deeds and acquire sublime characteristics. His
beautiful words became a valuable means of calling people, teaching
them, instilling good manners in them, enlightening their minds and
reviving their hearts, because of what they contained of eloquent
expressions, clarity of meaning and deep thought. Moreover, they
stemmed from a pure heart.390By way of example, we will list some
of these sayings:

1. "Prayer at night brings radiance to the face during the
day."391AUah ($g) says: $And those who spend the night
in worship of then Lord, prostrate and standing), (Qur'an
25: 64). He also said: "The light of the believer results from
the optional prayer during the night."392
2. "The soundness of religious commitment comes from
restraint, and corruption thereof results from greed."393

3. "Glad tidings to the one who acts upon what he
knows."394
4. "Opportunity passes as quickly as a cloud."39'

5. "Hardheartedness comes from a full stomach."396
6. "Prominence stems from virtue and good manners, not

8. "A good attitude brings ample provision."399
9. "Kindness is one of the best of treasures."400

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

437

A group of people gathered in the presence of Amir alMu'mineen 'ALi ibn Abi T2ib and discussed kindness.
Amir al-Mu'mineen took this opportunity to encourage
them and urge them to he kind, and he said: "Kindness is
one of the best of treasures and one of the best of crops.
You should not be discouraged from doing acts of
kindness by the ingratitude of those who reject it and deny
it. Kindness cannot be complete except with three things:
thinking little of it, concealing it and hastening it. If you
think little of it, you will make it great; if yon conceal it,
you will perfect it; and if you hasten it, you will give
people the chance to enjoy and appreciate it."401

10. "There is no nobility with had manners."402

11. "There is no rest for the envious."403

warning is based on the verse, #And [remember] the Day
when the Bilirn [wrongdoer, oppressor, polytheist] will
bite at his hands.) (Qur'an 25: 27)
16. "Concealing hardship is a sign of chivalry."408

that became widely known among people
and which sum up a great deal of his experience of life in brief
phrases that cany deep meanings and reflect noble goals and aims.
They had an impact on the life of the society in which he lived and on
the following generations until today. These sayings, speeches,
poetry and exhortations are among the means that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi m b (&) used in guiding, directing and
teaching the Muslim society.

3.5. Comments of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib (&) on the attributes
of the best of people, the supererogatory
worship of the Prophet (g),
and his
description of the noble Companions
3.5.1. The attributes of the best of people
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi Tglih (&) was asked about
the best of people, and he said: 'Those who, if they do righteous
deeds, they become cheerful and hopeful, and if they do wrong
deeds, they ask for forgiveness; if they are faced with trials, they are
patient, and if they get angry, they forgive."43ZHe also said: "Allah
($g) has slaves, and it is as if they heady saw the people of paradise
who will he in paradise forever and the people of hell who are being

punished there. People are safe from their evil, their hearts are filled
with sorrow, their souls are pure and their wants are few. They were
patient for a few days for the sake of a long rest. When you see them
at night, you see them standing on their feet (in prayer) with tears
flowing down their cheeks, praying to Allah (%) to ransom their
necks. As for their days, they are virtuous, forbearing, righteous and
pious. One might look at them and think that they are sick, but there
is nothing wrong with them. They mix with people, but they are
preoccupied with a very serious matter."433
Another of his sayings is: "When the believer looks at
something, it should be to learn a lesson; when he is silent, it should
be because he is thinking about something; and when he speaks, he
should speak words of
He also said: "Glad tidings to every person who is not known
or prominent; he knows people, but people do not know him; he
knows Allah (&) and strives to please Him. Such people are beacons
of guidance, and Allah (&) will save them from every dark trial and
will admit them into mercy and grace from

influenced by the words of the Messenger of Allah (&): "Allah loves
the slave who is pious, independent of means and unknown to the
people."437

3.5.2. 'Ali's (&) answer to the one who asked him
about the supererogatory worship of the Prophet (&)
It was narrated that '&im ibn Damurah said: "We asked 'Ali
(&)about the supererogatory worship of the Prophet (&) during the
day. He said: 'You cannot do it.' We said: 'Tell us what you think we
can do.' He said: 'When the Prophet (g)
finished praying the dawn
prayer, he would wait until the sun was here (meaning in the east) as

high as it is here (meaning in the west) at the time of the afternoon
prayer, then he would get up and pray two raka'ahs. Then he would
wait until the sun was here (meaning in the east) as high as it is here
(meaning in the west) at the time of the noon prayer, then he would
get up and pray four raka'ahs. (And he would pray) four raka'ahs
before the noon prayer when the sun passed the meridian and two
afterwards, and four raka'ahs before the aftemoon prayer, separating
each two raka'ahs with s a l h upon the angels who are close to Allah
(s)and the Prophets and those who followed them of the believers
and Muslims.' 'Ali (&) said: 'That is sixteen raka'ahs of optional
prayer that the Prophet (g)
did during the day, and very few people
can persist in doing that."'438

Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)Among

the reports

narrated by Abn ArZkah are these words: "I prayed the dawn prayer
with 'Ali. When he finished praying and turned to the right to face us,
he stayed still, as if he were depressed, until the sun had risen the
height of a spear above the wall of the mosque. He prayed two
raka'ahs, then he gestured with his hand and said: 'By Allah, I have
seen the Companions of Muhammad (g),
and I did not see anything
like them today. In the morning, they would look yellow, unkempt
and dusty, with a mark between their eyes that looked like a goat's
knee. They spent the night prostrating to Allah ( B ) standing
,
and
reciting the Book of Allah, alternating between prostration and
standing. Then in the morning when they mentioned the name of
Allah (&),they would sway like trees on a windy day, and their eyes
shed tears until their clothing got wet. By AUah
it is as if the
people now are becoming negligent.' Then he got up, and he was
never seen smiling after that until he was killed by Ibn Maljam, the
evil enemy of ~ l l a h . " ~ ~ '

3.5.4. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)

pointed out to his companions the best deeds
Among the speeches that are narrated from him are his words:
"I urge you to fear Allah, for the best means by which a person may
draw close to AUah are faith, jihad for the sake of Allah and a word of
sincerity (the Islamic testimony of faith), for that is the natural
inclination (of humans) instilled by Allah; and establishing prayer,
for it is the foundation of religion; paying zak2h because it is
obligatory; fasting the month of Ramadan because it is protection
against His punishment; going on pilgrimage to His house because it
is purification of sin; upholding ties of kinship because that extends
one's life and increases love of family; hidden charity because it
expiates sins and extinguishes the wrath of the Lord; doing kind
deeds because they protect against a bad death, and remembering
Allah ( B )a great deal because that is the best of remembrance."443

3.5.5. Visiting the sick
It was narrated from Thuwayr ibn Abi F m t a h that his father
said: "Ali (&) took me by the hand and said: 'Let us go and visit alHasan because he is sick.' We found Abu Moosa with him, and 'Ali
said: 'Have you come to visit him because he is sick, 0 Abu
Moosa, or is it just a (social) visit?' He said: 'No, I am visiting him
because he is sick.' 'Ali (A)said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah
(g)
say: "There is no MU.& who visits a Muslim (because he is
sick) in the morning but seventy thousand angels will send blessings
on him until evening comes, and if he visits him (because he is sick)
in the evening, seventy thousand angels will send blessings upon him
until morning comes." ' "444

(4)

3.5.6. Encouraging his son al-Hasan
to give speeches
Amir al-Mu'mineen said to his son al-Hasan one day: "0 my
son, why don't yon give speeches so that I can hear you?" He said:
"When I see you, 1feel shy to give speeches." So 'Ali went where alHasan could not see him, then al-Hasan stood up and addressed the
people while 'Ali was listening, and he gave an eloquent speech.
When he finished, 'Ali said: "Offspring one of the other, and Allah
(g)
hears and knows all things."445

3.5.7. " I am not as you think"
'Amr ibn M u d narrated that Abu al-Bukhtari said: "A man
came to 'Ali and praised him, but 'Ali had heard that the man had

I am better than you think."'446

3.5.8. Warning against giving in
to whims and desires

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi ibn Abi Tilib
said: "Beware of
giving in to whims and desires because the immediate consequences
are bad, and the long-term consequences are worse. If you cannot get
control of your whims and desires by means of warning and
punishment, then try to use the method of encouragement and
thinking of reward, because if the deterrent and incentive come
together, you will subject yourself to both, and you will be able to
control your desires."447

3.5.9. Making a Muslim happy
'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said: "One of the means of attaining
forgiveness from Allah is making your Muslim brother happy."448

3.5.10. The most difficult of actions are three
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T%b said: "Among the most
difficult of actions are three: allowing others to settle scores with yon,
remembering Allah (&) in all situations and helping your brothers

financial^^.""^

3.6. Warning against serious diseases
3.6.1. The consequences of sin
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) said: 'The
consequences of sin are having no energy for worship, a reduced
livelihood and reduced physical pleasure." It was said: "What is
reduced physical pleasure?' He said: "He will not indulge in any
permissible pleasure hut something will come to spoil it."450 This
was encouragement and a deterrent from sin. Amir al-Mu'mineen

446

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of life

'Ali (&) did not neglect to point out the positive consequences of
refraining from sin, as he said: "Whoever wants glory without the
suppoa of a large family, offspring without having a lot of children
and independent means without wealth, let him move from the
humiliation of sin to the glory of obedience."451 He also said: "If you
want to attain a position of prominence, avoid what is har21n."~~~

3.6.2. Hoping for a long life and
following whims and desires

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib
delivered a
sermon on the minbar of Kufah. He praised and glorified Allah (s),
then he said: "0people, what I fear most for you is hoping for a long
l i e and following whims and desires. As for hoping to live a long
life, it makes one forget the hereafter. As for following whims and
desires, it makes one abandon the truth. Indeed this world is coming
to an end, and the hereafter is starting soon. Each one of them has
children, so be among the children of the hereafter and do not be
among the children of this world, because today is good deeds with
no reckoning, and tomorrow is for reckoning with no deeds."453
In this speech, Amlr al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) pointed out two
serious matters that have a great impact on people's lives. The first is
hoping to live a long life, because that deceives man so he is
distracted by worldly aims and ambitions, which make him postpone
righteous deeds and forget the hereafter; thus his effort for this world
becomes great, and his effort for the hereafter becomes small. If
every person bore in mind the fact that he is wlnerable to death at
any moment, his efforts in this world would become very little, only
as much as is necessary, and his efforts for the hereafter would
become great, because that is what will remain after death. The
second matter is following whims and desires. This diverts a person
and makes the highest gains in his life the attainment of his own

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

447

whims and desires and the whims and desires of those under whom
he works, so he forgets the supreme Islamic goal, which is seeking
the pleasure of Allah (&) and His bounty in paradise. When the aims
and goals are changed, the plan of action changes and becomes
focused on worldly matters, the aims of which do not go beyond this
life. It also changes relationships and ties, which become based on
worldly interests instead of faith and piety, and there are other
consequences of changing goals.454

3.6.3. Showing off
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Do not do any good deed
to show off, and do not refrain from doing it out of shyness."455He
also said: "There are three signs of the show-off:he is lazy when he is
alone and active when he is with other people; he does more if he is
praised because of it; and he does less if he is criticised because of
it.,,456 The texts of Sharia described showing off as a lesser form of
polytheism. The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: '"The thing I fear most
for you is lesser polytheism." They said: "What is lesser polytheism,
0 Messenger of Allah (g)?"
He said: "Showing off. Allah will say
on the Day of Resurrection, when He will reward the people for their
deeds: 'Go to those to whom you used to show off in the world, and
see whether you find any reward with them."'457 It was also narrated
that Shaddgd ihn Aws said: "At the time cf the Messenger of Allah
(g),
we used to regard showing off as lesser polytheism."458
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
warned against serious diseases
of the heart that have to do with the desire to please another person
and show off to people. He encouraged people to focus their intention
on Allah
alone, to devote their acts of obedience to Him alone
and to adhere to the way of the Prophet's Sunnah. It is proven from
h i that he said: "No words x e good unless accompanied by action,
and no action is good unless accompanied by intention, and no

(s)

448

The oath ofallegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

intention is good unless it is in accordance with the ~ u n u a h . "It~ ~ ~
was narrated from al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyid that he recited the verse:
cf... that He may test you which of you is best in deed ...Bi (Qur'an 67: 2)
He said: 'The most sincere and most correct." They said: "0 Abu
'Ali, what is the most sincere and most correct?He said: "If the
deed is sincere but not correct, it is not accepted, and if it is correct
but not sincere, it is not accepted, unless it is both sincere and correct.
It is sincere when it is done solely for the sake of Allah (&), and it is
correct when it is in accordance with the ~ u n n a h . " ~ ~ '
The forms of showing off are many, including those which
involve actions, such as when a person prays and makes the standing,
bowing and prostrating lengthy and makes a show of humility when
people are looking at him. It may involve words, such as showing off
by exhorting, reminding, memorising stories and reports for the
purpose of debating and making a show of abundant knowledge, or
moving one's lips in dhikr when in the presence of people but
neglecting it at home. Showing off may involve clothing and
appearance, such as leaving the mark of prostration on the forehead;
wearing rough and coarse clothing and making it very short (above
the ankles, for men) so that it might be said that one is an ascetic and
worshipper; or wearing a certain type of clothing that is usually wom
by those who are regarded by people as scholars, so that it might be
said that one is a scholar. Showing off may also involve one's friends
and visitors, like the one who tries to ask a scholar or worshipper to
visit him, so that it might be said that so-and-so visited him, or
inviting people to visit him so that it might be said that good people
often come to his house. It may involve keeping company with
shaykhs, so that it might be said that so-and-so met many shaykhs
and learned from them, so that he can boast about it. Showing off
may be in worldly terms, such as the one who walks and struts in a
proud manner, or turns his cheek from others or wraps himself in a

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

449

cloak or drives his car in a certain manner. It may be in physical
terms, such as looking thin and wan so that people will think that he
is serious in worship, fears Allah ( g ) a great deal and is filled with
sorrow. There are many other forms that showing off may take, by
means of which the show-offs seek to attain high status in people's
hearts and minds.461
In general, adhering to righteous deeds, remembering and
worshipping Allah a great deal, fearing Him alone and not fearing
people when devoting oneself to Allah, loving the righteous people
and so on - all of these are good and righteous deeds that are
necessary. But it is essential that they should all be for the sake of
Allah (g),
because showing off means doing the righteous deeds for
someone other than Allah (g).
It is imperative for the believer to
correct his intention and make it for the sake of Allah ( g ) alone. He
should not give up doing righteous deeds for fear of showing off. Let
those people beware of the seriousness of the disease of showing off
and remember the words of the Messenger of Allah (g)
"Whoever
:
seeks to acquire knowledge in order to debate with the jurists and to
try to compete by means of it with the scholars or to divert people's
attention to him, Allah ($$) will admit him to the
Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) warned against showing off
and explained that deeds cannot be accepted unless they are sincerely
for the sake of Allah (g)
and in accordance with the Sunnah of the
Messenger of Allah (g).
On many occasions, he urged people to
adhere to the Sunnah. He said: "Follow the guidance of your Prophet
(g),
for it is the best of guidance, and follow his Sunnah, for it is the
best of ways."463

3.6.4. Self-admiration
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said: "Selfadmiration is the most serious of problems."464 Self-admiration is

450

7 k oath of allegiance to Xli, his characteristics & his way oflge

one of the problems that spoil deeds and lead people to doom. Selfadmiration is one of the obstacles faced by those who strive in their
march towards Allah (g).
It is a disease that is contrary to sincerity,
and it keeps one away from humility and the sense of needing Allah
(&). It represents a bad attitude towards Allah (&). Moreover, selfadmiration keeps a person from evaluating himself and turns him
away from finding out about his problems and faults. Yet we rarely
hear discussion of this problem, even though it is very serious,
hannful and widespread.
Abdullah ibn al-Mubkak said: "Self-admiration means
thinking that you have something that others do not have."465 Ibn
Taymiyah differentiated between showing off and self-admiration,
and said: "Self-admiration is akin to showing off, but showing off is a
kind of including people as a motive for one's efforts, whereas selfadmiration is including oneself with Allah (%) (in the sense that one
remembers one's talents but forgets that they all come from Allah and
by His help). So the show-off is not fulfilling the words 'You (Alone)
we worship', and the one who admires himself is not fulfilling the
words #and You [Alone] we ask for help,) (Qur'an 1: 5) because the
one who fulfils the words 'You (Alone) we worship' will avoid
showing off, and the one who fulfils the words 'and You (Alone) we
ask for helpp' will avoid self-admiration."466
Al-Ghazili said: "It should be noted that the problems
resulting from self-admiration are many. Self-admiration leads to
arrogance. So what is generated by self-admiration is arrogance, and
arrogance leads to many problems that are not hidden. Selfadmiration leads to forgetting and overlooking one's sins. As for acts
of worship, (the one who admires himself) thinks that his acts of
worship are great, and he uses them as evidence of his righteousness;
he thinks that he is doing Allah (g)
a favour by doing them, and he
forgets the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him by enabling

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

451

and helping him to do them. The one who admires himselE is too
confident in himself and his opinion, so he feels safe from the plan
and punishment of Allah, and he thinks that he has some status before
Allah. His self-admiration makes him praise himself a great deal."467
Al-Qurz said: "The reason why self-admiration is h a r h is
that it is a bad attitude towards Allah, may He be exalted, because a
slave should never think of as great the acts of worship by means of
which he seeks to draw close to his Master; rather he should think of
them as little in comparison to the greatness of his Master, especially
the greatness of Allah (&). Hence AUah (%) says: he^ made not a
just estimate of Allah such as is due to Himb (Qur'an 39: 67). This
means that they did not venerate Him as He deserves to be venerated.
Whoever develops self-admiration and admires his worship is
doomed before his Lord, Who is aware of him. He has exposed
himself to the wrath and anger of Allah (&)."468 It may be said that
self-admiration results from two things:

(s),

(a) Ignorance of the rights of Allah
not making a just
estimate of Allah (&) such as is due to Him, lack of
knowledge of the names and attributes of Allah and not
worshipping Allah on the basis of proper understanding of
His name and attributes.

(b) Not understanding the nature of the ego (lower self),
ignorance of its faults and problems, and negligence in
checking and watching oneself.469
Hence the remedy is to learn about Allah (&), realise His
greatness, make a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him, base
servitude to Him on knowledge of His beautiful names and sublime
attributes, and worship Him on that basis, for all goodness is in His
hands, and His mercy encompasses all things. (And whatever of
blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah.) (Qur'an 16: 53)

I

452

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

Imam ash-Shsa'i said: "If you fear that self-admiration will
affect your deeds, remember the One Whom you are trying to please,
what blessings you are trying to seek and what kind of punishment
you are seeking to escape. The one who thinks of that will see his
deeds as insigr~ificant."~~~
An-Nawawi said: "The way to rid oneself of self-admiration is
to know that knowledge is a blessing from Allah
and a complete
favour. That belongs to Allah (&) which He takes away, and that
belongs to Him which He gives, and everything has an appointed
time with Him, so a person should not develop self-admiration for
something that he had nothing to do with and has no control over, and
it is not certain that it will last."471

(s)

Ibn al-Qayyim said: "It should be noted that when a person
says or does something, seeking the pleasure of AUah (B),
realising
the blessings that Allah
has bestowed by enabling him to do or
say it and knowing that Allah (&) helped him with regard to that,
and he is doing it by the help of Allah ($1 and not by his own power,
knowledge, thought and strength - rather it is Allah (&) Who
created for bim his tongue, heart, eyes and ears -therefore He is the
one who blessed bim with what be said or did. When that becomes
well entrenched in his mind, then self-admiration will not develop in
him, because self-admiration results from focusing on one's own self
and not realising the blessing and help of one's

(s)

As for the other remedy for self-admiration, it is to know
oneself and to keep taking stock of oneself. Ibn al-Jawzi said:
"Whoever thinks of the inclinations of his own self and the sins that
his self is committing will realise his sins and shortcomings for
certain and will be uncertain with regard to other people. What he
must beware of is self-admiration and exaggerating about the
righteous deeds that he is doing for the hereafter. The believer in that
regard is always thinking little of himself. It was said to 'Umar ibn

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

453

'Abdul-'Azeez (&): 'If YOU die, we will bury you in the chamber of
the Messenger of Allah (g).'
He said: 'If I meet Allah with all kinds
of sin except for polytheism, that is dearer to me than thinking of
myself as qualified for that."'473
Ihn Hazm said: "Whoever is tested with self-admiration, let
him think of his faults; if he admires his virtues, let him think of his
bad manners and attitude. If he cannot find any, to the point that he
thinks that he has no faults, then he should realise that his problem is
chronic and that he is the most imperfect of men, and has the most
faults and least discernment. That is because he is feeble-minded and
ignorant, and there is no fault worse than these two, because the wise
man is the one who can see faults in himself and tries to overcome
them, whereas the foolish man is the one who is ignorant of his own
faults. If you admire your opinions, then think of the number of times
when yon got it wrong; remember them and do not forget them.
Think of every time you expressed your opinion and it turned out to
be wrong, and someone else got it right and you were mistaken. If
you admire your knowledge, then remember that it is not from
yourself; rather it is a pure gift from Allah (&) that was given to you
by your Lord, so do not respond to it in a way that angers Him, for He
may cause you to forget it by means of a problem with which He may
test you, which may result in you forgetting what you have learned
and memorised. If you are impressed by your brothers' praise for
you, then think of the criticism of your enemies; then your selfadmiration will disperse. If you have no enemies, there is nothing
good in you; there is no one whose status is lower than the one who
has no enemy. It is no more than the status of the one who has no
blessing from Allah (%) for which to he envied, may Allah keep us
safe and sound. If you
little of your faults, then think of them if
people found out about them. Imagine people finding out about them,
then you will be embarrassed and will recognise your
shortcomings."474

think

454

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali,his characteristics & his way of lqe

Ibn al-Qayyim said, speaking about the wisdom behind the
divine decree allowing evil deeds and sins, that one of the reasons for
this is that: "When Allah (g)
wills good for His slave, He causes
him to forget his acts of obedience and erases them from his mind and
from his lips (so that he does not speak about them). But if he
commits a sin, He makes him think about his sin all the time and
forget his good deeds, so that he focuses constantly on his sin, when
he stands up and sits down, when he comes and goes. This is the
essence of mercy concerning him, as one of the early generation said:
'A person may commit a sin and enter paradise because of it, and he
may do a good deed and enter hell because of it.' They said: 'How is
that?' He said: 'He does one wrong thing and keeps thinking of it,
and whenever he remembers it he weeps, feels regret and repents and
asks for forgiveness. He turns to Allah ($) and beseeches Him, and
he humiliates himself before Him and does righteous deeds, so this
becomes a cause of mercy for him. Another person may do a good
deed and keep thinking about it, so he feels proud of it before his
Lord and before people, and he becomes arrogant because of it and
wonders why people do not show respect to him and honour him
because of it, and this continues until it takes its toll on h i and
causes him to enter hell."'475
This is a brief explanation of the words of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&): "Self-admiration is a disease of the mind and heart."476

3.7. Ali's concern about setting guidelines for the
marketplace, and various incidents in which
he took a stand in order to correct peopIe

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b
was keen to
check on people's dealings in the marketplace and to force them to do
business in accordance with the laws of Islam. It is proven that 'Ali

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

455

(&) gave a great deal of attention to checking on and inspecting the
marketplace. It was narrated from al-Hum ihn Jarmooz al-Muridi that
his father said: "I saw 'Ali ihn Abi T2ih (&)
, ., come out of the palace
wearing two striped garments; his lower garment came to mid-calf
and his upper garment was wrapped tightly around him. He was
carrying his stick and walking about in the marketplace, enjoining
them to fear Allah (&) and he honest in dealing. He said: 'Give just
measure, and do not take out the marrow from hones when selling
meat."'477

It was narrated that Abu Marar said: "I came out of the mosque
and heard a man calling out from behind me: 'Lift up your lower
garment, for that is cleaner for your garment and more pleasing to
your Lord, and cut your hair if you are a Muslim.' I walked behind
him,he was wearing the waist wrapper and an upper gamient on his
shoulders, and he was carrying a stick, as if he were a Bedouin of the
desert. I said: 'Who is this?' A man said to me: 'You must be a
stranger in this city.' I said: 'Yes, I am from Basra.' He said: 'This is
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib, Amir al-Mu'mineen.' When he reached the place
of Ibn Ahi Ma'eet, he saw him driving his camels and said: 'Sell, and
do not swear an oath, for an oath may cause an item to be sold, but it
erases the blessing.' Then he went to the date sellers and saw a female
servant weeping. He said: 'Why are you weeping?' She said: 'This
man sold me some dates for a dirham, hut my master refused to
accept them.' 'Ali
said to him: 'Take your dates and give her a
dirham, for she has nothing to do with it.' And he gave her the
dirham. I said: 'Do you know who this is?' He said: 'No.' I said:
'This is 'Ali ibn Ahi Tilib, Amir al-Mu'mineen.' So she gave back
the dates, and he gave her a dirham. Then the man said: 'I would like
you to he pleased with me, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen.' He said: 'Why
should I be pleased with you if you give people their dues (because
there should he nothing special about that)?' Then he passed by the
date sellers and said: '0 date sellers, feed the poor, and your earnings

will increase.' Then he went - with the Muslims with him - until
he came to the fish sellers and said: 'No fish that was found floating
dead should be sold in our marketplace.' Then he went to Dar Fnrit,
which is the market of the cotton ~ 1 0 t h . " ~ ~ '
It was narrated that Zad2n said: " 'Ali used to walk in the
marketplace on his own, guiding those who had gone astray and
helping the weak. He would pass by the sellers and grocers and
would start with them, reciting Qur'an, and he would recite: (That
home of the hereafter [i.e. paradise], We shall assign to those who
rebel not against the truth with pride and oppression in the land nor
do mischief by committing crimes.) (Qur'an 28: 83) Then he said:
'This verse was revealed concerning just and humble people among
the governors and people in power, to the exclusion of other
people."'479~l-~hal121
narrated with his chain of narration that Abu
Sa'eed said: 'ALi used to go to the marketplace and say: '0 people
of the marketplace, fear Allah (&) and beware of swearing oaths, for
an oath may help to sell the item, but it erases the blessing. Traders
are evil, except the one who takes his dues and pays his dues. Peace
be upon you.' Then he left, then he came back to them and said
something similar to them."480

This direct supervision on the part of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ibn Abi T a b (&) may indicate a number of things, including the
following:
(a)

That his tour of the market was not limited to supervising and
giving guidelines only; rather it went further than that and
involved serving the people in their affairs, such as guiding
one who had gone astray and helping the weak. If a person is
like that, his words and exhortations will be more effective and
will have a greater impact on people's hearts.

Sincere advice to fear Allah (&) and be honest in dealing.
Sometimes he quoted Qur'an to remind them, because the one
who fears Allah will treat people with kindness and be sincere
towards them and will keep away from deceiving and cheating
them.

(c)

Forbidding wrongdoing in transactions and restoring people's
rights, because the master of the slave woman who bought the
dates did not approve of this purchase, and she herself had no
say in the matter.

(d)

Forbidding all kinds of deceit that happens in marketplaces,
such as removing the marrow from the bone that is covered
with meat.

(e)

Explaining some rulings and etiquette that have to do with
transactions among people, including the following:
- Prohibition on swearing oaths when selling. The reason

given for this is that an oath may help to sell the item, but it
wipes out the blessing, as was narrated from the
Messenger of Allah (g):
"An oath may help to sell the
item, hut it erases the blessing."483
- Encouraging and urging people to feed the poor, because

this increases earnings.
Prohibition on selling fish that was found floating dead in
the water. Perhaps this was so that it would not be mixed
with the fresh catch.

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
used to check on traders' affairs
himself, and he instructed his governors in the provinces to do
likewise. He would praise those who did well; as for those who
committed transgressions after being told not to, he would punish
them, without going to extremes.484 He had some beneficial
instructions and prohibitions which encouraged people to adopt the

458

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

best of characteristics and adhere to the Islamic rulings. The
following are some examples:

3.7.1. Denunciation of mixing between
men and women in the marketplaces

(4)

Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali , , would denounce people who
did not prevent their womenfolk from going out to the marketplaces
and mixing with the disbelievers. He said to them: "Do you not feel
any shame or protective jealousy? For I have heard that your
womenfolk go out in the marketplaces and mix with the
di~believers."~~~

3.7.2. Do not refuse a little profit
lest you be deprived of a lot
'Ali (&) used to enter the market with his stick in his hand
and wearing a cloak, and he would say: "0 merchants, take what is
due and give what is due, and you will be safe and sound. Do not
refuse a little profit, lest you be deprived of a lot." He looked at a man
who was cutting fabric and said to him, "Are you cutting when we are
still close to the time of the Messenger of Allah (@J?I shall ask you a
question and if you respond, d l well and good; otherwise I shall beat
you to the ground with this stick. What reinforces religious
commitment and what undermines it?" He said: "As for what
reinforces it, it is piety, and what undermines it is greed." He said:
"You have done well. Cany on cutting, because a man like you is one
who should

3.7.3. The danger of getting involved in trading
before properly understanding its Sharia rulings
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi T%b (&) said: "The one
who gets involved in trading before fully understanding the religion

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

459

will get involved in usury, then he will get involved in usury, then he
will get involved in usury. 'Umar (&) used to hit with his stick
anyone who sat in the marketplace and did not know the rulings, and
he would say: 'No one should sit in our marketplace who does not
know about
'Ali (4)
also used to say: "No one should
sell in our marketplace except one who has acquired deep
understanding of the religion; otherwise he will consume usury,
whether he wants to or not."488
The Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them)
paid attention to aJl matters of ruling, and no one matter took up their
attention at the expense of another. Thus the situation did not go
beyond the control of the ruler. They established guidelines for trade,
which kept the market in good shape, regulated business transactions
and guaranteed stability and steadiness. There were no unfair deals,
cheating, hoarding, black market or ignorance of what was and was
not permitted in the world of trade.
It is possible today to teach traders by means of study circles in
the mosques, especially those that are located in marketplaces. It is
essential to address them by means of pamphlets and brief audiotapes
that explain the d i n g s on business and simplify issues that have to
do with it, highlighting the following issues:
- Presenting selected examples of Muslim business owners

who are sincere to their religion and who support the cause
of Allah (fg)
and His Messenger with their wealth.
- Explaining the importance of the hereafter for them so that

they may combine the good things of this world and the
hereafter.
The scholars and seekers of knowledge have an important duty
to educate this large sector of society. The Islamic movements should
not forget their duty to teach their members who are involved in
business and others about this important issue.

3.7.4. "The one who gets to a place first
has more right to it"
There was an issue concerning trading spots in the market, and
'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) gave a verdict in the marketplace of Kufah
stating that the one who gets to a place first has more right to it, as
long as he is still there during that same day. If he moves from that
spot, then it is permissible for someone else to take it. Al-Ashagh ibn
Nabitah said: "I went out with 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib to the marketplace,
and he saw that the people of the marketplace had reserved spots for
themselves. 'Ali (&) said: 'What is this?' They said: 'The people of
the marketplace have reserved their spots.' He said: 'They do not
have the right to do that. The marketplace of the Muslims is like the
prayer place of the Muslims; whoever gets there first, it is his for the
rest of the day unless he leaves it."' This principle was followed until
the governorship of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah. When Ziy2d ibn
Abeehi became governor in 49 AH, he ruled that the one who sat in
the place was more entitled to it as long as he remained there.489

3.7.5. "The hoarder is an accursed sinner"
Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) said concerning
the hoarding of food: "The one who brings food to the market is
granted provision, and the hoarder is an accursed sinner."490Amir alMu'mineen ordered that hoarded food be burned. Al-H%i& ibn Abi
Shaybah narrated that al-Hakam said: "Ali was told about a man who
hoarded food, one hundred thousand, and he ordered that it be
burned."491
Ibn Q u d h a h was of the view that the hoarding that is
prohibited is that which meets the following conditions:
(a) That it is bought from the marketplace. If he brings
something from elsewhere or keeps something that he

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

461

already had, he is not a hoarder. This is clear from the
words of 'Ali (&).

(b) That what is bought is a staple food.492
(c) That hardship is caused to the people by someone's buying
it in order to hoard it.
'Ali's waming against hoarding was based on the words of the
"No one hoards except a wrongdoer."493
Messenger (g):

3.7.6. "Loss is to be taken horn the capital,
and profit is to be shared out as agreed
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&) explained some
of the mlings on rnudiirabah, which is a kind of business dealing
among people. It involves giving a known amount of wealth to
someone to trade with it, in return for some of the profit. 'Ali (&)
said: "Loss is to be a e n from the capital and profit is to be shared
out as agreed."494 Loss is to be borne by the pamership and is to he
taken from the wealth. In other words, it is to be borne by each
partner according to how much he has put in. If each p m e r put in an
equal part,495then the loss is shared equally between them. If it is
thirds. then the loss is divided on this basis.

3.7.7. Burning of a village in which
alcohol was sold
'Ali (&) strongly denounced those who sold alcohol, and he
ordered the burning of a village in which alcohol was sold. Imam
Abu 'Ubaydah alQ2sirn ibn S a l h narrated that 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib
(&) looked at ~ u r i r a h
and
~ ~said:
~ "What is this village?" They
said: "It is a village called Zur2rah. Meat is slaughtered there, and
alcohol is sold there." He got up and went there and said: "Bring the
fire and set fire to it, and let evil consume itself." The narrator said:

"It was burned from the west as far as the Garden of Khawgsta ibn
~ubroona."~~~

3.7.8. Checking on matters to do
with clothing and appearance
It was narrated that Abu Matar said: "I went out of the mosque
and there was a man calling out behind me: 'Lift up your lower
garment, for that is cleaner for your garment and more pleasing to
your Lord, and cut your hair if you are a ~ u s l i m . " ' ~ ~ ~

3.7.9. Detaining evildoers and mischief makers
'Ali (&) would pursue evildoers and mischief makers, and if
he caught one of them he would detain him. Al-Qii& Abu Yoosuf
narrated that 'Abdul-Miilik ibn 'Umayr said: "If there was among the
tribe or people a promiscuous or immoral man, 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib
(&) would detain him. If he had wealth, he would spend on his
maintenance from his wealth; if he did not have any wealth, he would
spend on him from the public treasury of the Muslims." He also said:
"Protect the people from his evil, and spend on him from their
treasu~~."~~~

3.7.10. Warning against not spending
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) said: 'The miser
is the one who seeks to hasten poverty and Lives in this world like the
poor; he will be brought to account in the hereafter on the basis that
he was rich."500

3.7.11. 'Ali's call to prayer
Amir al-Mu'mineeu 'Ali ibn Abi T S b (&)
,.
paid a great deal
of attention to the matter of prayer. He would walk through the

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

463

streets, calling "Prayer, prayer," and he would wake the people for
the dawn prayer in this way. Al-Hasan (&)told us that on the day he
was stabbed, he went out from his house. When he came out of the
door, he called out: "0 people! Prayer, prayer." He did that every
day, carrying a stick. Two men intercepted him, and Ibn Maljam
struck him on the head.501

3.7.12. Paying attention to public works
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ordered the building of waterways in
the wadis and sewers, lest the road of the Muslims be blocked.50z

3.7.13. The innovation of the storytellers,
and 'Ali's efforts to fight it
The innovation of the storytellers appeared during the time of
'Ali (&), and it was denounced by the Companions and the
T2bi'oon. Muhammad ibn Waddih nmated that Moosa ihn
Mu'2wiyah said: "Ibn Mahdi narrated to us from Sufyzn from
'Ubaydullah ihn NZ' that he said: 'Stories were not told at the time
of the Prophet (g)
or the time of Ahu Bak~,
'Umar and 'Uthmk. The
first time stories were told was during the turmoil (the murder of
'Uthmh)."'503
The storytellers were preachers who held gatherings for
preaching in competition with the gatherings of knowledge. They
exhorted the people by telling stories, tales narrated from Jewish
sources, and so on which had no basis or were fabricated, or were
beyond the comprehension of the masses. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ihn Ahi T%h (&+) banned them because they started telling the
people about weird things and ambiguous matters, and things that
were beyond their comprehension and of which they had no
knowledge.504Amir al-Mu'mineen permitted those who had strong
Sharia knowledge to tell stories in order to exhort the people.

464

The oath of allegiance to 'Ali, his characteristics & his way of life

'Ali's life in society was a call to tawheed and striving against
polytheism. He was keen to teach people the names and amibutes of
Allah
connect their hearts to Him alone, remind them of the
blessings of Allah (g)
and urge them to be grateful for them. He
(&) was also persistent in his efforts to eliminate any traces of preIslamic ignorance, using all kinds of means such as speeches,
exhortations, poetry and proverbs. He did not live a life that was
remote and removed from the people; rather he lived among them on
the basis of his good attitude, manners and knowledge (&).

(s),

3.8. The Police force at the time of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib
When 'Ali (&) was appointed as the new caliph, the police
force was one of the important departments in the state. There are
many stories and reports that speak of the role of the police at the time
of 'Ali (4).
For example, Ashagh ibn Nabitah narrated that a young
man complained to 'Ali ibn Ahi T%h (&) about a group of people.
He said: "These people went out with my father on a journey; they
returned, but my father did not return. I asked them about him, and
they said that he died. I asked them about his wealth, and they said
that he did not leave anything, although he had a great deal of wealth
with him. We referred the matter to Shurayh, and he asked them to
swear an oath and let them go." 'Ali (&) called the police. He
appointed two policemen for each one of them and instructed them
not to let any of them get close to another and not to let anyone speak
to them. He called his scribe, then he called one of the men and said:
"Tell me about the father of this young man. On what day did he go
out? Where did you halt? How was your journey? How did he die?
How did he lose his wealth?" He also asked him about those who
washed him and buried him, who led the funeral prayer for him,
where he was buried and so on, and the scribe wrote it all down. Then

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

465

(a)

'Ali
said takbeer, and everyone present said takbeer. The other
accused person had no knowledge about what was going on, but he
thought that their companion had confessed about them. After the
first one had been taken away, 'Ali(&) summoned another and
asked him the same questions. He carried on lihe that until he had
heard what they all had to say, and he found that each one of them
said something different than his companions. Then he ordered that
the first one be brought back, and he said: "0 enemy of Allah, I am
aware of your stubbornness and lies because of what I heard from
your companions. Nothing can save you from punishment except
telling the truth." Then he ordered that he be imprisoned, and he said
takbeer, and everyone present said takbeer. When the other people
realised what was happening, they did not doubt that their companion
had testified against them. Then he called another one of them and
threatened him, and he said: "0Amir al-Mu'mineen, by Allah, I was
not happy with what they did." Then he called all of them, and they
admitted what had happened. He summoned the one who was in
prison, and it was said to him: "Your companions have confessed,
and nothing will save you except telling the truth." So he admitted
everything that the others had admitted. He forced them to give back
the money, and he took blood money from them for the one who had
been slain.505
This story contains many implications which are useful for
those involved in investigations. At the same time, it proves that there
were prisons and policemen?06 Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali
built a
prison in Kufah which he called Nifi', but it was not well prepared
for prisoners, and they were able to get out of it. He demolished it and
built a replacement, which he called ~ u k h e e s . ~He
~ 'provided the
inmates with what they needed of food, condiments and clothing in
the winter and summer?08 Amir d-Muvlu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
had a police force whose members included Abu al-Hayij al-Asadi,

Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubiidah, Ma'qil ibn Qays ar-Rayy%i, Maik ibn
Khubayb al-Yarhoo'i, al-Asbagb ibn Nabiitah al-Mushiija'i and
Sa'eed ibn SGyah ibn Murrah al-Khuzi'i. One of the roles played by
the police in society was helping the needy and those in trouble by
guiding the lost, feeding the poor, offering help, showing kindness
and other humane acts of help by means of which the countenance of
Allah (&) may be sought.
Hence we can see clearly that the security forces during the era
of the Rightly Guided Caliphs played a civic role in offering general
services to the public. Their role was not limited only to security
matters, even though that was their main focus.

CHAPTER FOUR

Financial and judiciary Institutions
at the time of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi Tslib, and some of
his views on Islamic jurisprudence

1. Financial institutions
A t the time of 'Aliibn Ahi T2lib (&), there were not many
changes worth mentioning in the financial policies of the Islamic
state. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)returned to the way of Ahu B&T
as-Siddeeq (&) in giving equal stipends to the people,' and he did
not show preference to anyone; he gave to slaves as he gave to their
masters.' In some regions, the treasury was entrusted to the
governors themselves. Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubidah, the general
governor of Egypt, was in charge of the treasury there. Similarly,
when 'Ali (&,) sent al-Ashtar an-Nakha'i to be governor of Egypt,
he indicated that in addition to his general duties, he was responsible
for the treasury and for supervising it in a way that served the
people's interests. He explained: "Because if the people are in good
shape, than the treasury will continue to be in good shape. The affairs
of the community cannot be sound unless they are in good shape,
because all the people are dependent on the treasury and on those
who are in charge of it. So your focus should he on developing the
land to bring about prosperity, more than on collecting money from
the people, because collection of taxes is dependent upon prosperity.

468

Financial andjudicia~yinstitutions at the time of 'Ali

Whoever seeks to collect taxes without paying attention to prosperity
will harm the country and destroy the people, and he cannot last as
governor except for a little while. If they complain about burdens,
problems, shortages of water or damage to the land because of
flooding or drought, then you should reduce their burden as much as
you think may help them out, because the more you focus on
prosperity, the better results you will get. The ruin of society results
from the poverty of its people, and the poverty of the people results
from the greed of governors and their focus on collecting taxes.
Because of their misguided thinking, they will stay there for a long
time, hoping to live for a long time, and not learning from the lessons
of othersm3
The way Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) viewed the treasury is
something that went beyond collecting money; it encompassed the
economy of the country as a whole, as the land tax formed the main
source of income at that time. 'Ali (&)
was known for being very
, ,
strict in keeping an eye on his agents in all that ~ e did.
y The treasury
and financial affairs were important matters that Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi T2ih (&) kept a close eye on. He used to send spies
and intelligence gatherers to find out about these rnatter~.~
The
governors had general authority to spend from the wealth and public
t r e a s q of their provinces. The governors who were in direct control
of the treasury and tax collectors at the time of the caliphs used to
spend in legitimate ways from the wealth that they had when it was
needed. They used this wealth for matters of jihad, such as preparing
weapons and mounts, paying soldiers' salaries and other expenses.
They also gave salaries to official workers and employees in the
province.5 In addition to that, they used to cany out construction
projects, such as building bridges and digging channels, springs and
rivers, all of which required spending from the money that they
collected from their provinces.6

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

469

In some situations, control of the treasury was separate from
the job of the governor. In that case, as part of their general
supervision of the province, governors required the officials in
charge of the treasury to spend on the activities mentioned above.
Alternatively, the governor would hire workers to supervise a
particular project, and the costs of the work would be paid from the
income of the province through the treasury department. So even if
the role of the treasury was separate from that of the governor, as has
been suggested by some researcher^,^ spending was still supervised
by the governors in many cases, whether it was for jihad or for
development.
Some Islamic jurists have pointed out that the governors had to
spend in the interests of the Muslims and not freeze this wealth,
because holding this wealth that was taken lawfully, and not
spending it on the interests of the Muslims, would be equivalent to
taking it in an unlawful manner. They regarded freezing public
wealth a7 something unjust and as a shortcoming on the part of
g o ~ e r n o r sThe
. ~ regions and provinces were more entitled to their
wealth and tax revenues than others, so the governors would not
transfer the treasury's funds from the provinces to the capital in
Madinah, or in Kufah later on, until they had covered the needs of
their provinces first.9
Undoubtedly what the Rightly Guided Caliphs did, especially
at the time of 'Umar (&), in terms of organising a precise system of
financial affairs in the provinces, collecting sources of income or a
general income in addition to general expenditure, is regarded as a
new system. Nonetheless, this did not prevent them from benefiting
from the experience of those who had come before them as they
introduced the govemment ministries and controlled their financial
affairs in all aspects. I have discussed the financial institutions during
the era of 'Umar (&) in some detail. Any reader wishing to know

470

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

more about that may refer to my book Fasl al-Khitcibfi Seerat Ameer
al-Mu'mineen 'Umar ibn al-Khattcib (available in English under the
title 'Umar ibn al-Khagcib - His Life and Times).
Some Mentalists, including Philip Hitti in his History of the
Arabs, have tried to undermine the importance of the efforts of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them) in
organising the wealth of the state in general. Hitti writes:
"Later developments, the result of many years of practice, were
attributed by this tradition to the initiative of 'Umar. The fact is that
the original part which the first caliphs and the early Moslem [sic]
governors played in the imposition of taxes and the administration of
finances could not have been great. The framework of the Byzantine
provincial government in Syria and Egypt was continued in Allah's
name, and no radical changes were introduced into the machinery of
local administration in the former Persian domains. From the very
beginning taxation varied according to the nature of the soil and the
system that had prevailed in that locality under the old rule, whether
Byzantine or Persian; it did not necessarily depend upon the
acquisition of land by capitulation (sulhan) or by force ('anwatan)
nor upon any legislative act on the part of mar."'^
The writer ignored reports that were narrated about the way in
which 'Umar (&) worked out the tax on lands conquered by force,
and how this new system was opposed by some of the Companions
before the matter was settled and they all agreed to adopt it."
Muhammad Diya' ad-Deen ar-Rayyis took on the task of refuting
these Orientalists and their views, on the basis of authentic historical
texts. He concluded that this claim has no sound basis and that the
Muslims and their jurists differentiated between that which was
introduced by 'Umar and that which was introduced by others.
Indeed, they discussed in great detail the issue of tax collection at the
time of 'Umar (&,).I2

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

471

It is the habit of the Orientalists and their lackeys to criticise
and undermine the great figures of Islam. The problem is that they
find people in the Ummah who view their writings with respect and
admiration.
Due to the wars and internal conflict, the Muslim state at the
time of 'Ali (&) was negatively affected with regard to its various
institutions, suck as the financial and military ones. The position of
caliphate itself was also affected, and this played a role in the demise
of the Rightly Guided Caliphate. We will discuss this in more detail
below.

2. Judicial institutions
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) was appointed as
caliph, and his appointment resulted from the murder of 'Uthmin
(&) and subsequent events that split the Muslims and created
division in their ranks. His main preoccupation and focus was
confronting these issues in order to bring the Ummah together, but
the bloody conflict at the time of 'Ali (&) did not prevent him from
giving some attention to organising the judiciary. This is indicated by
a letter" that he sent to al-Ashtar an-Nakha'i, his governor in Egypt,
in which he said:
"Then select to judge between people one whom you think is the best
of your people, one who is unflappable, who does not get offended
by opponents, who does not get canied away if he makes a mistake,
who will not refrain from turning towards the huth when he
recognises it, who does not have greed and ambitions, who is not
content with one explanation only before listening to all others, who
takes his time and does not rush into passing judgement on
ambiguous issues, who relies most on evidence, who does not get

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

I1

annoyed with people referring to him and coming back to him, who is
most patient in studying and examining the case until it becomes
clear, who is the most decisive once the verdict becomes clear in his
mind, who does not become too proud if he is praised and is not
tempted easily. Such men are few. Then check regularly on the way
he handles cases, and be generous towards him so that he will not be
in a state of poverty or need, and thus he will not need people. Show
great respect to him, so that no one could hope to get his way with
him of people who are close to you, and so that he can feel safe and
secure with you from the aggression of people close to you."14

This letter also says: "Give precedence to Allah ( B )and to
people over yourself and those who are close to you of your family
and those of your subjects whom you love and are close to. Unless
you do that, you will be unjust, and if anyone is unjust to the slaves of
Allah, He will be his opponent on behalf of His slaves. The one who
is opposed by Allah (&) will not have a leg to stand on; Allah (&)
will declare war on him until he gives it up or repents. There is
nothing that leads to changing the blessing of Allah and hastening
His vengeance more than persisting in injustice, for Allah (@)
answers the prayers of the oppressed, and He is watching the
oppressors like a guardian on a watcht~wer."'~
We may note that this advice includes a discussion of the
qualities of the judge and his rights and duties. The one who ponders
what Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) wrote to his governor in Egypt
will be amazed by this advice that was written in the year 40 AH or
thereabouts, at a time when the Arabs had had no contact yet with
other civilisations, and how the sound mind which is guided by the
light of Allah ( B )was able to come up with such ideas and lay out
guidelines that would ensure the smooth running of the affairs of
state, in a way that is better than what we see today of constitutions
and manmade laws.16 Later, 'Ali's ideas of fairness towards people

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

473

and avoiding injustice towards them formed the basis for setting up a
department to look into injustice."

2.1. Judiciary and legislative plan at the time
of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and the sources
to which the Companions referred at that time
What is meant by this plan is the method followed by the
Rightly Guided Caliphs and the noble Companions (may Allah he
pleased with them) when t~yingto work out Sharia mlings on new
situations and cases that occurred in their daily lives. They were
guided to this method by the close company they kept with the noble
Messenger of Allah (g)
and the education and training they received
from him. Hence following this method became obligatory upon
those who came after them.
We have noted in our study of the era of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs in our hooks on Ahu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthrnk, and in the
current study on the era of 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all),
that every tine they came across a new issue or needed a verdict, they
would turn to the Book of Allah (&) first of all. If they found the
Sharia ruling for the new issue there, then the matter would he settled,
otherwise they would refer to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah
(g).
If they did not find the solution there, they would move on to
working it out on the basis of their personal view in the broad
meaning of the term. We have noted that this way of working things
out was initially done collectively in most cases, especially if the
issue had to do with matters of state, which is something general in
nature. What helped in that regard was the fact that the senior
Companions were still living in Madiuah, which made it easy to
bring them together and listen to their views. The collective
agreements that stemmed from these consultations were later known

474

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

as ijmci ' or consensus. They made use of analogy and ma~lahah(that
which serves the interests of the Muslims), which is the aim of
Sharia.
The best evidence for this plan is the words of Maymoon ibn
Mahr2n who said: "If two disputants came to Abu Bakr, he would
look in the Book of Allah (&). If he found there anything that would
decide the matter between them, he would judge in accordance with
it. If there was nothing in the Book, and he knew of any precedent
from the Messenger of Allah (g)
concerning that matter, he would
judge in accordance with it. If he could not find anything in the
Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (g),
he would call together the
prominent and best of the people and consult them. If they agreed on
something, he would judge in accordance with it. 'Umar did
likewise; if he could not find an answer in the Qur'an and Sunnah, he
would look to see it if there was a similar case that Abu Bakr had
ruled on, otherwise he would call the prominent Muslims; if they
agreed on something, he would judge in accordance with it."''
It was narrated that Ibn Mas'ood said: "Whoever is presented
with a case after today, let him rule in accordance with the Book of
Allah. If there comes to h i a case which is not mentioned in the
Book of Allah, and concerning which there is no verdict from His
Prophet (g,)),
let him refer to the verdict of the righteous people. If
there comes to him a case which is not mentioned in the Book of
AUah, and concerning which there is no verdict from His Prophet
(B)or from righteous people, let him try to work it out on the basis
of his knowledge. Let him not say: 'I think, but I am not sure,'
because what is hal2l is clear and what is h a r h is clear, and in
between there are ambiguous matters, so leave that which makes you
doubt for that which does not make you d o ~ b t . " ' ~
In our discussion on the ultimate reference points in the state
of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&), we have discussed

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

475

his eagerness to follow the same method. From these reports, it is
clear that in their legislative and judicial plans, the Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them) used to rely on the Qur'an and Sunnah
before moving on to opinions in the general sense."
Now let us and draw some conclusions from these reports:

1. The Companions were agreed on this method, and the steps they
followed in trying to find answers to problems were in the
following order: First, they started with the Book of Allah, then
they moved on to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (g),
before resorting to working it out collectively and then analogy.
2.

Legal precedent played an important role in this procedure; its
role was second only to the texts.

3.

It is worth noting with regard to this method that Abu Bakr and
'Umar, in particular, did not consult anyone except those of the
Companions who were already present in Madinah. There is no
report to indicate that they would summon those of the
Companions who were absent for the purpose of consulting
them on any issue that required some working out. This indicates
that consensus was reached on the basis of agreement among the
Companions who were present, regardless of the opinion of
those who were absent. It is clear to us from the plan of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs and the Companions in legislation and
jndicial matters, that every time they bad a problem to solve or
came across a case they needed a ruling on, they hastened to
consult the Qur'an first of all. If they did not find a solution
there, they would refer to the Sunnah. If they did not find a
solution there, they would work it out on the basis of their own
views in the general sense thereof, whether they reached this
conclusion collectively or individually. The decision that
resulted from their collective opinions is called consensus,
which is a reference that was introduced by them and was not

476

Financial andjudiciay institutions at the time of 'Ali

known at the time of the Prophet; this came to be regarded as the
third source or reference point after the Qur'an and Sunnah. As it
was not always possible to gather the Companions for the
purpose of consultation and reaching consensus on a certain
issue, for various reasons, the Companions began to issue fatwas
and verdicts based on individual opinions. They relied on the
Qur'an and Sunnah in their individual and collective opinions,
and they relied on deep understanding of the aims of Sharia,
which seek to ward off evil and achieve interests. For matters on
which there were no clear texts, they derived rulings on the basis
of the spirit of the texts, not on their apparent or literal meaning.
They used analogy from the time of the Messenger (g);
this is
the fourth reference point of the legislation and comes after
consensus in status, even though it was known before it."
These are the sources on which the Rightly Guided Caliphs
and the noble Companions relied:

1. The noble Qur'an, which is the main foundation, the fount of
wisdom, the miracle of the message, the guide for eyes and
insight. There is no way to Allah (&) except through it.
2.

The Sunnah, which is what was transmitted from the Prophet
(g)
via sound chains of narration.

3.

Consensus, which must be based on a text of the Qur'an or
Sunnah, or analogy.

4.

Analogy.

The Rightly Guided Caliphs and the noble Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them) developed rulings on new issues on the
basis of interests to which attention must be paid or harms that must
be protected against. Their conclusions on issues for which there is
no text were broad in scope and paid attention to the people's needs
and interests."

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

477

2.2. Distinguishing features of the judiciary
at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
The judiciary at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs (may
AUah be pleased with them) represented the second stage, after that
of the prophetic era, which formed the roots and foundations. On the
one hand, it represented the complete shucture and comprehensive
system; on the other hand, it gave an excellent image of the Islamic
judiciary. It is regarded as an example and a model, a focal point for
all subsequent eras. We may sum up the most important
distinguishing features of the judiciary at the time of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs (may Allah he pleased with them) as follows:
1. The judiciary at that time was a continuation of the way it was at
the time of the Prophet (g);
it adhered to and followed its
method. Religious education was widespread, and the people
were strongly connected to faith and correct beliefs. mere was a
strong religious awareness and simplicity in the way claims and
cases were dealt with, and judicial procedures were
straightforward. There were few claims and disputes in
relation to the size of the state. and the number of people and
countries it encompassed. Judges were chosen carefully and had
all the qualities required to fill this position.

The judges then are regarded as giving a true and sound image of
the Islamic judiciary; hence that era became a reference point for
researchers and Muslim jurists. Their judicial rulings and
systems became a source of Sharia rulings, judicial opinions and
interpretations of Islamic law throughout the ages on the basis of
consensus, at least theoretically, among all scholars and schools
of thought, even though there are some differences in some
subtle details. An example of that is the differences among the
imams as to whether the view of a Companion may he used as
evidence or not, as is discussed in the fields of principles of

478

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

Islamic jurisprudence, classification of hadiths and the history of
legislation. We will discuss that below.

3.

The Rightly Guided Caliphs and some of the regional governors
examined some disputes and were in charge of the judiciary, in
addition to other gubernatorial duties. They paid careful
attention to dealing with disputes between people and inspecting
the marketplaces.23

4.

In most cities of the Muslim regions, the Rightly Guided Caliphs
appointedjudges, whose main job was to judge between people,
in exclusion of other duties. For the first time, in a primitive
form, there appeared the separation of judiciary authority from
other forms of authority. In the major cities where judges were
appointed alongside the governors, the governors had no
authority in judicial matters. In the other cities and regions, the
governors were in charge of both the judiciary and the other
matters involved in governing, and they were under the
supervision of the Rightly Guided Caliph.

5. Judges at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs had to work out
their verdicts, so they would look at the texts of the Qur'an and
Sunnah directly and reach their conclusions on the basis of what
they understood. If they did not find any ruling applying to an
incident, they would examine precedents and consult their
contemporary scholars to try to reach a conclusion on the basis
of what they understood, and then they would issue the ruling
that they had reached by those efforts.

6. New sources for the judiciary appeared at the time of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs, as a result of the method to which they adhered,
which is outlined above. Now the sources of judicial rulings
were: the Qur'an, the Sunnah, consensus, analogy, legal
precedents, and individual opinion combined with consultation.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

479

7. A precise administrative system for the judiciary was developed

during this time. Both 'Umar and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased
with them) sent well-known letters to the judges and govemors,
highlighting the judiciary system and explaining its constitution
and methods. In addition to these letters, the caliphs followed up
with the judges and monitored them. They discussed issues with
them, asked how they were doing and found out how they were
handling their cases. They also asked them to refer difficult and
serious cases to them. This involvement reached a peak at the
time of 'Umar (&)
,.
but decreased a Little during the time of
'Uthmh (&). It weakened at the time of 'Ali (&), as a result
of the turmoil and civil war, as well as the emergence of the
autonomous trend in Syria and the consequences to which it led,
in addition to the development of a number of power bases.

8.

The qualifications of the judges were general in most cases and
covered all incidents. The authority of the judge was
comprehensive, and he had complete freedom in decisionmaking. Later during that era, there emerged the beginning of
specialisation among judges. Certain judges would be appointed
to deal with simple and straightforward cases, and others would
be appointed to deal with serious cases and major issues. Most of
the caliphs continued to examine cases of criminal acts and hadd
punishments, even though some of the govemors did that, too.
This era also saw the appointment of multiple judges at one time
in the larger cities and provinces such as Madinah, Kufa, Basra
and Yemen. Military judges also were appointed for the first
time.

9. During this era, they continued to follow the way of the
prophetic era in supervising and checking judicial verdicts and
approving those that were in accordance with the Qur'an and
Sunnah and those which were based on personal effort and

480

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

opinion. A personal view and interpretation cannot be cancelled
out by means of another personal view and interpretation, but it
may be cancelled out if it is conbary to the Qnr'an and Sunnah."

10. Regular salaries for judges were introduced to make their lives
comfortable, and courthouses and prisons were set up. For the
first time, we see the reluctance of the senior Companions to be
appointed as judges. Ibn 'Umar was asked by 'Uthmh to serve
as a judge, but he refused. Ka'b ibn Yas& ibn Dannah was asked
by 'Umar to serve as a judge in Egypt, but he also refused, it was
also said that he accepted for a few days, then he withdrew?'
11. Judicial procedures at this time were simple and straightforward.
They involved only a few steps, starting with listening to the
case, then establishing proof and evidence, issuing the verdict,
and finally, carrying out the verdict. Attention was paid to the
etiquette of judging so as to protect the weak, support those who
had been wronged, ensure equal treatment of disputants,
establish the truth and implement Sbaria laws for all people,
even if the ruling went against the caliph, amir or govemor. In
most cases, the judge would carry out the rulings himself, if
other parties involved would not do so willingly. The ruling
would be carried out immediately after issuing the verdict.
However, it seems that at the time of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs, many new procedures and organisational details were
introduced. Scribes for judges were introduced at the time of
'Umar (&); the police and helpers for the judge and govemor
appeared at the time of ' U t h i i n (&); and this system of
criminal investigation developed at the time of 'Ali (&), when
he separated the witnesses in order to find out the truth. This
method became an example to be f ~ l l o w e d ? ~

2.3. The most famous judges of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) retained some of
the judges who had demonstrated their high calibre and had been
appointed to that post before his caliphate, and he appointed some
other judges and governors,27 including tbe following:

1. Shurayh ibn al-H2rith who was in charge of the judiciary in
Kufab. 'Ali (&) approved of his post and paid him five hundred
dirhams every month."
2. Abu Moosa d-Asb'ari, whom 'Uthm2n (&) bad appointed to
the judiciary in Kufah. 'Ali (&) confirmed him in this post but
later dismissed him."
3.

'Ubaydullah ibn Mas'ood, the governor and judge of Yemen.

4.

'Uthmin ibn Hmeef in Basra.

5.

Qays ibn Sa'd in Egypt. He had been present at the conquest of
Egypt and had a house there. He governed it for 'Ali (&), then
he was dismissed and replaced by Muhammad ibn Abi ~ a k r . ~ '

6.

'Amirah ibn Shihsb in Kufah.

9. Abdullah ibu 'Abbk, who was 'Ali's governor in Basra. Abu alAswad ad-Duwali was in charge of its judiciary, and some
interestiug verdicts were narrated from him. According to
mother opinion, Abdullah ibn 'Abbss appointed 'AbdurRalpn211 ibn Yazeed al-Hudini to be in charge of the judiciary in

482

Financial and jndiciaiy institutions at the time of 'Ali

Basra. He was the brother of d-Mnhdlab ibn Abi Sufrah,
through his mother. He remained as the judge during the
caliphate of 'Ali ibn Abi Taib and the time when MuZ2wiyah
was in charge, until Ziyid came and dismissed him.?' Abu
'Ubaydah said: "Ibn 'AbbL used to issue fatwas to the people
and judge between them."34 Whenever Ibn 'Abbh left Basra, be
would appoint Abu d-Aswad to be in charge, and he was the
mufti, as the judge was known at that time. It remained like that
until 'Ali (4)
was killed in 40 AH. When Amir d-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi T3ib (&) left Madinah and went to Basra, he
appointed Abdullah ibn 'Abbis to be in charge of the
10. Sa'eed ibn N i m h d-Hamadiini, whom 'Ali (&) appointed
when he came to Kufah, then he dismissed him. He was
appointed as judge of Kufah by Mus'ab ibn az-Zubayr, and he
held this post for three years until Ibn az-Zubayr appointed
Abdullah ibn 'Utbah ibn ~ a s ' o o d . 3 ~
11. 'Ubaydah as-Salmini, Muhammad ibn Hamzah, whom 'Ali
appointed to the judiciary of Kufah after dismissing Sa'eed dHamadhiki. He said to him: "Judge as you used to judge." Then
he dismissed him and appointed Shurayh. Al-Sha'bi said:
"Shurayh was the most knowledgeable of people about judicial
matters, and 'Ubaydah was equal to Shurayh in that. He passed
some interesting verdicts, and he was one of the well-known
scholars of Kufah. Shurayh used to consult him and refer to
him."37
12. Muhammad ibn Yazeed ibn Khnlaydah ash-Shaybhi. 'Ali
appointed him as a judge in Kufah, and he issued some verdicts
'Ali's judges in Egypt were also his governors in various
cities, because their governorship was general and included ruling,

483

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

administration, carrying out hadd punishments, leading the prayers,
judging, collecting zakih and other duties.39 'Ali (&)
. . required his
governors to be careful in appointing judges, which indicates that he
gave tbem the authority to appoint judges in the land under their rule.
Moreover, in most cases, the governors were themselves the judges
of the cities in which they lived, but there are reports which mention
the names of a number of judges in different cities at the time of 'Ali
(&), as we have seen above. It seems that the governors of cities had
the right to examine appeals made by people against some judicial
rulings, primarily those passed by the judges appointed by them and
not by the caliph. They also had the right to examine appeals from
other cities concerning verdicts given by judges who had been
appointed by the caliph, because they had general authority in their
provinces;40 however, they used to discuss these cases with the
caliphs. It is well known that the caliphs would open their doors to
anyone who brought a complaint, whether the complaint was against
the governors, judges, tax collectors or anyone else.41

2.4. Judicial style of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
his view of verdicts issued before his time,
those who were qualified to act as judges and
free access to the judiciary system
2.4.1. His preservation of judiciary style

It seems that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) intended to introduce
some changes in the way the judicial system was run and how cases
were heard, thinking that this was appropriate due to new
developments in the society, but he deferred that unt~lthings settled
down. It is narrated from h ~ m(&I that he said: "Judge as you used
to judge untll you are un~ted,for I fear difference^."^'

484

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

2.4.2. Not nullifying verdicts
issued before his time
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was keen to achieve stability,
and he thought that a judge had no right to nullify a verdict issued by
another judge. 'Ali had written down the treaty between the people of
N a j r h and the Prophet (g),
but at the time of 'Umar (&), their
numbers increased until he feared for the people concerning them. A
disagreement arose among them, and they came to 'Umar (&)
asking for compensation, so he compensated them. Then they
regretted it, and something happened among them, so they came to
him and asked him to let them off, but he refused to do so. When 'Ali
(&) became caliph, they came to him and said: "0 Amir alMu'mineen, you interceded for us and wrote a treaty with your right
hand." 'Ali (&) said: "Woe to you! 'Umar was right in what he
did.43 I will never undo the verdict of 'Umar."

2.4.3. Qualifications for the
position of judge
The judiciary is a public post, so the same conditions are
required for a judge as for anyone else who is appointed to a public
post over the Muslims, namely being of sound mind, being an adult
and being a Muslim. In the case of the judge, it is stipulated that he
should have no interest in what people possess, he should be
forbearing and not provoked by words, he should not be angered by
misbehaviour, and he should be knowledgeable of the rulings of
Sharia and of what abrogates and what is abrogated. 'Ali ibn Ahi
TSib said to a judge: "Do you know what abrogates and what is
ahrogated?" He said: "No." He said: "You are doomed and cause
others to he doomed."44 'Ali asked him about that because
knowledge thereof was not an easy matter at that time.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

485

It is also stipulated that the judge should have knowledge of
the verdicts of previous judges, so that he will not drift away from
their way and so as to avoid chaos in rulings or things getting out of
hand. He should also be humble and should not have any reservations
about consulting men of knowledge, reason and wisdom, because
this consultation will help him to avoid m i s a e s in his verdicts. He
should be courageous in adhering to the truth, so that he will not
delay giving his verdict, even if he angers the people in authority. All
of that is summed up in the words of 'Ali (&): "The judge cannot be
a judge unless he has five qualities: lack of interest in material gain, a
forbearing nature, knowledge of what came before him, willingness
to consult people of knowledge and wisdom, and not fearing the
blame of anyone for the sake of Allah (&)."45

2.4.4. Location for judgement
The judge should choose a place to hear cases that is located in
the middle of the city, so that it will not be difficult for anyone to get
there. 'Ali (&J) told Shurayh, the judge, to sit in the main mosque,46
so that it would he easy for the people to reach him.47

2.4.5. Free access to the judiciary system
Since establishing justice among people is one of the aims of
the Islamic state, Islamic law dictates that there should be no barrier
between one who has been wronged and restoration of his rights. The
two disputants should not have to pay the judge or the state any
money in order to obtain the verdict that settles the dispute between
them. Rather it is the Islamic state that covers the expenses of the
judge and the court. 'Ali (&) gave Shurayh a salary in return for
serving as a judge; when he appointed him as judge of Kufah, he paid
him five hundred dirhams every month.48

486

Financial and judicialy institutions at the time of 'Ali

2.4.6. Emergence of the idea of lawyers
The idea of lawyers began to emerge at the time of the Rightly
Guided Caliphs. 'Ali (&) appointed his hrothe~'Aqeel to represent
him in cases, and when 'Aqeel grew too old, he appointed Abdullah
ihn Ja'far ihn Abi Taib to appear on his behalf in front of the judges.
He used to say: "If the outcome is in favour of my agent, then it is in
my favour, and if it is against my agent, then it i s against me."49

2.5. What is required of the judge
In order to attain justice in rulings, attention must be paid to
the foUowing:

2.5.1. Careful study of the case presented
It is not right for the judge to hasten to issue a verdict before
examining the case completely and feelmg satisfied with the
conclusion reached. Hence 'Ali (&) said to Shurayh: "Your tongue
is under your control as long as you do not speak, hut once you speak
you are bound by what you say. So think about what your verdct is,
and the has~sfor your verdict, and how to work out your v e r d ~ c t . " ~ ~

2.5.2. Equal treatment of disputants
'Ali (&)had a guest who stayed with him for a few days, then
he brought a dispute to him. 'Ali (&)
. ., asked him: "Are you a
disputant?" He said: "Yes." 'Ali (&) said: "Then leave us, for we
are not allowed to have a disputant staying with us unless his
opposite number is with him." (He meant that he was required to
treat both of them equally.)51

'Aliibn Abi TJZib

487

2.5.3. Not shouting at the disputants
'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) appointed Abu al-Aswad ad-Du'ali as
a judge. Later, 'Ali (&) dismissed him, so he asked: "Why did you
dismiss me when I have never done anything wrong?" He said: "I
saw that you raise your voice against two disputants."5z

2.5.4. Keeping away from things
that may influence the judge's verdict
The judge should strive to keep his own inclinations in check,
whether these are based on relationships with others, financial
factors, hatred or anything else. Ja'dah ibn Hubayrah came to 'Ali ihn
Abi T2ib (&) and said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, two men come to
you, and you are dearer to one of them than his own self, hut the other
would slaughter you if he could -and you pass judgement in favour
of the latter?" 'Ali (&) poked him and said: "If it were a personal
matter, I would have done (what you think), hut my judgement is for
the sake of Allah (&)."53

2.5.5. Consultation
The judge must consult people of knowledge, lest he gave a
wrong verdict. 'Ali (&) was one of the members of the consultative
committee whom the caliphs were keen to consult when faced with
difficult issues. Al-Khass2f said in Adab al-Qedi that if the two
disputants came to him, 'Uthmk ibn 'Af& would tell one of them
to call 'Ali (&), and he would tell the other to call Tabah and azZubayr or some of the Companions of the Messenger of AUah (@J.
When they came to him, he would say to them: "Speak." After they
had spoken, he would turn to the Companions and ask: "What do you
think?" If they said something that he agreed with, he would give the
verdict on that basis and would not discuss the matter further.54

3. The Islamic jurisprudence of
Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (&)
3;l.With regard to acts of worship
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi Tilib (&) never spared any
effort to explain the rulings on acts of worship to the people, because
of what he enjoyed of great abundance of knowledge and
understanding of Islam. What he taught the people about the rulings
on acts of worship would require many huge volumes;55 therefore,
we will refer to just a few of his rulings by way of example:
Rulings on purification

1. The urine of a baby girl needs to be washed,
and the urine of a baby boy needs only to be
sprinkled if he does not yet eat solid food

(4)

said: 'The urine of a baby girl
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali
needs to be washed, and the urine of a baby boy needs only to be
sprinkled if be does not yet eat solid food."56 The evidence for that is
that when al-Husayn ibn 'Ali urinated in the lap of the Prophet
Lubibah hint al-H%ith said: "0 Messenger of Allah (&), give me
your gannent and put another on." He (g)
said: "The urine of the
male only needs to be sprinkled, whereas the urine of the female
needs to be washed."57

a),

2. The sleep of one who is sitting up,
and the ruling if he breaks wind
'Abdur-Razziq nanated in his Musannaf that 'Ali, Ibn
Mas'ood and ash-Sha'bi said concerning a man who sleeps while
sitting: "He does not have to perform ablution ( w ~ d o o ' ) . "This
~~
may be understood as referring to very Light sleep or dozing, because

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

489

of the hadith by Anas ibn M2lik (&), who said: "The Companions
of the Messenger of Allah (g)
used to wait for 'ish2' prayer until
they began to nod off; then they would get up and pray, without
renewing their ablution." (recorded by Muslim, Ibn Abi Shaybah,
Abu Dswood, ad-D&aqutni and d-Bayhaqi)
With regard to deep sleep, where one becomes completely
unaware of what is happening around one, in that case ablution is
essential because the Messenger of Allah (gJ
said: "Whoever sleeps
should perform ablution..." This point of fi& is also indicated by the
hadith of the Messenger of Allah (g):
"That which seals the back
passage(anns)is the eyes; whoever sleeps should perform ablution."59

3. Washing off pre-seminal fluid
and doing wudoo' because of it
Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
said: "I was a man who had a
, ..
lot of pre-seminal fluid, so I told a man6' to ask the Prophet
because I was married to his daughter- so he asked him, and he (@J
said: 'Do wudoo' and wash your sexual organ."'61

(s)

4. Reciting Qur'an without the mushaf in whatever
state one is in, a s long as it is not a state of ritual
impurity d u e to sexual activity or emission
'Ali ibn Ahi Tilib (&) said: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
used to teach us the Qur'an in whatever state he was in, as long as he
was not a state of ritual impurity due to sexual activity or
emission."62 It was narrated that 'h
ash-Sha'bi said: "Recite
Qur'an as long as one of you is not in a state of ritual impurity due to
sexual activity or emission. If he is in that state, then he should not
even read one letter."63

5. Intercourse with a menstruating w o m a n
'Umar (&) asked 'Ali: "What do you think about a man who
has intercourse with his wife when she is menstmating?" He said:

490

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

"He does not have to offer expiation, but he has to repent."64 The
Urnmah is unanimously agreed that it is h a r h to have intercourse
with a menstruating woman, and there is no difference of opinion,65
because Allah ( B )says:
%Theyask you concerning menstruation. Say that is an Adha [a
harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife
while she is having her menses], therefore, keep away from women
during menses and go not unto them till they are purified [from
menses and have taken a bath]. And when they have purified
themselves, then go in unto them as AUah has ordained for you.)
(Qur'an 2: 222)

6. Intimacy with a menstruating woman

'Ali (&)
. . was asked: "What can you do with your wife if she
is menstruating?" He said: "(Be intimate with her) above the waist
wrapper."66 The evidence for that is that it was narrated that 'A'ishah
(I&) said: "If one of us was menstruating, the Messenger of AUah
would tell her to wear a waist wrapper, then be would be
intimate with her."67

(4)

Rulings on p r a y e r
1. Qur'an is not t o be recited w h e n bowing or prostrating
'Ali ihn Abi T%b (&,) said: "The Messenger of Allah (B)
told me not to recite Qur'an when I was bowing or prostrating."68

2. The one w h o does not pray is a disbeliever
Amir d-Mn'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi T a b (&) was asked: "0
Arnir d-Mn'mineen, what do you think about a woman who does not
pray?" He said: "The one who does not pray is a d i ~ b e l i e v e r . " ~ ~
Abdullah ihn Shaqeeq said: "The Companions of the Messenger of
did not think that refraining from any action constituted
Allah (g)
disbelief except prayer, because it is an act of worship by means of

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

491

which one enters Islam, like the testimony of faith, so by not doing it
one exits ~slarn."'~This ruling is supported by the words of the
Messenger of Allah (g):
"Between a man and polytheism and
disbelief there stands his giving up prayer."71 Imam an-Nawawi said:
"The one who does not pray, if he denies that it is obligatory, then he
is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims, and he is
beyond the pale of Islam, unless he is new in Islam and has not mixed
with Muslims for long enough to have leamed that prayer is
obligatory for him."

If he does not pray because he is lazy, although he believes that
it is obligatory - as is the case with many people - then the
scholars differed concerning him. Milik and ash-ShZa'i (may Allah
have mercy on them) and the majority of the earlier and later scholars
were of the view that he is not a disbeliever; rather he is an evildoer
who should be asked to repent. If he repents, all well and good;
otherwise, he is to be executed as a hadd punishment, like the married
adulterer, except that he should be kiUed by the sword. On the other
hand, a number of the earlier generations were of the view that he is a
disbeliever. This was narrated from 'Ali ibn Abi Titlib (&) and is
mentioned in one of the two reports from Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may
Allah have mercy on him). It was also the view of AbduUah ibn alM u b h k , I s h k ihn Raawayh and some of the followers of ashShZa'i. Abu Haneefah and a number of the people of Kufah, as well
as al-Muzani, the companion of ashSh%aifa'i, were of the view that he
is not a disbeliever and is not to he executed; rather he should he
given a disciplinary punishment and imprisoned until he does pray.72

3. Repeating a prayer w i t h its time
If a worshipper prays alone and then repeats the prayer within
its time in order to attain the virtue of praying in ~ o n g r e g a t i o nthen
,~~
the first prayer is regarded as obligatory and the second is regarded as
supererogatory, according to 'Alj (&>). That was narrated from Ibn

492

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

Q u d h a h and from al-H&th from 'Ali (&). He said: "His first
prayer (was the obligatory one),"" meaning that the second one was
optional in this case. The evidence for that is the report narrated by
Abu Dharr, who said: 'The Messenger of Allah (g)
said to me:
'How will you be if there are appointed over you rulers who neglect
prayer and delay it from its proper time? If you are with them when
they pray, pray with them, and that will be a supererogatory prayer
for you.'"75 The point here is that he called the prayer that is offered
with a congregation (in this case) a supererogatoryprayer.76But if he
repeats the sunset prayer,77 he should make it an even number by
adding a raka'ah, according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated from alH%th that if he repeated the sunset prayer, he would make it even by
adding a raka'ah.78

4. Making up missed prayers
Whoever misses a prayer has to make it up. It is recommended
to make it up immediately according to 'Ali (&), who said: "If a
man sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets a prayer, let him pray when
he wakes up or remembers."79 The Muslims are unanimously agreed
on this, with no difference of opinion.80 The evidence for that is the
words of the Messenger of Allah (g):
"If one of you sleeps and
misses a prayer, or forgets it, let him offer the prayer when he
remembers, for Allah (&) says, (and perform as-Sulih [IqBmat-asSalih] for My remembranceb (Qur'an 20: 141.~'

5. ~ a r a w e e h 'prayer
~
It was narrated from Abu 'Abdur-Ram& as-Sulami that 'Ali
(&) led them in praying qiyim ul-layl 83 in ama ad an.^^ It was also
narrated that Isma'eel ibn Ziyid said: 'Ali passed by the mosques
during the month of Ramadan, and there were lamps in them." He
said: "May Allah fill 'Umar's grave with light as he filled our
mosques with light."85 On this the madh-habs of Ah1 as-Sunnah are
agreeda6, and the evidence for that is the report narrated by Abu
"

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

493

Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet (&) said: "Whoever prays
q i y h in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his
previous sins will be forgi~en."'~The point here is that taraweeh is a
kind of q i y h , so it is ~ u n n a h . ~
Praying
'
taraweeh in congregation is
better, according to 'Ali (&), and he used to offer this prayer in
congregation.89It was narrated that 'Arfajah ath-Thaqafi said: "'Ali
ibn Ahi Tilib would instruct the people to pray qiyim in Ramadan
and appoint an imam for the men and an imam for the women."
'Arfajah said: "I was the imam for the women."y0
There is a precedent for taraweeh prayer in the actions of the
Prophet (g).
It was narrated from 'Urwah ibn az-Zuhayr that
'kishah .. told him that the Messenger of Allah (g)
came out in
the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque, and some men
followed his prayer. The next day, the people were talking about that,
then more of them gathered; the Messenger of Allah (@) came out on
the second night, and they followed his prayer. The next day, the
people were talking about that, and the number of people in the
mosque increased on the third night. He came out, and they followed
his prayer. Then on the fourth night, the mosque could hardly contain
the people, and the Messenger of AUah (g,)
did not come out to them
until he came out for the dawn prayer. When he had finished the dawn
prayer, he turned to the people, recited the testimony of faith, and said:
"I was not unaware of your situation last night, but I feared that this
prayer might be made obligatory for you, and you would be unable to
do it." When the Messenger of Allah (@)died, that was how it was.91

(&)

6. Eid prayer in the mosque for the old and weak
When Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali ihn Ahi T%h was appointed
as caliph and went to Kufah, there were many people in the city, and
they said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, there are people in this city who
are old and weak, and it is hard for them to go out to the desert (for
the Eid prayer)." So 'Ali ihn Abi Tilib appointed a man to lead the

494

Financial and judiciary institlrtions at the time of 'Ali

people in offering the Eid prayer in the mosque, and he led the people
in prayer in the desert outside the city. This was not done previously,
but 'Ali (&) was one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and the
Prophet (g)
said: "Adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly
Guided caliphs after me."92 The one who adheres to the way of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs has obeyed Allah (g)
and His ~ e s s e n ~ e r . ~ ~

7. A m a n washing his wife (after she has died)
It is permissible for a man to wash his wife to prepare her for
burial, according to 'Ali (&), and he washed his wife Fgtimah (may
Allah be pleased with them both).94 It was narrated that Asma' bint
'Umays said: "Fitimah left instructions that when she died, no one
was to wash her except 'Ali (&) and me, so 'Ali and I washed
her."95 It is also narrated that there was consensus among the
Companions on that, because that was well known among them, and
no one objected to it?6 This was also the view of the majority of
scholars, and the evidence for that is the words of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
to 'kishah (r&,): "It will not matter if you die before me,
for I will take care of you, wash yon, shroud you, offer the funeral
prayer for you and bury you."97

8. The shroud is to be paid for from
the wealth of the deceased
The costs of shrouding the deceased are to be taken from his
capital if he had any capital, according to 'Ali (4$d).98
It was narrated
from Abdullah ibn ad-Dnmayrah from his father from his grandfather
that 'Ali (&) said: "The shroud is to be paid for from the capital (of
the d e ~ e a s e d ) . "The
~ ~ proof is that when Mus'ab ihn 'Umayr was
killed on the day of Ul.~ud,"We (the Companions) could not find
anything with which to shroud him except a woolen clo& which, if
we put it on his head, his feet showed, and if we put it over his feet,
his head showed. The Messenger of Allah (B)said: 'Put it over his
head, and put some (of a certain kind of) grass on his feet..1.100 The

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

495

point here is that if it was obligatory for the Muslims, he would have
taken from the Muslims who were present whatever was needed to
shroud him completely. lo'
9. The shroud of a man and a woman,
and not going to extremes in that

It is Sunnah to shroud a man in three pieces of cloth and to
shroud a woman in five, according to 'Ali (&). That was narrated
from him by d-Kas2ui and others.lo2Going to extremes in shrouding
is detested; according to 'Ali (&), this means using more than three
pieces of cloth for a man and more than five for a woman."3 Amir dMn'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "The shroud of a woman is five pieces of
cloth, and the shroud of a man is three, and transgress not. Verily,
Allah does not like the transgressors104.,,lo5

10. Washing and shrouding of the martyr
The martyr is not to be washed or shrouded, according to 'Ali
(&). That was narrated from him by d-Kas2ni and others.Io6It was
narrated that he did not wash those who were killed fighting
alongside him against those who opposed him, and he did not instnrct
that they should he shrouded. He buried 'Ammir (&) without
washing him.'07 This is the view of the majority of scholars, apart
from al-Hasan d-Basri and Sa'eed ihn d-Musayyab, whose view is
that the deceased is in a state of impurity and needs to he purified by
water.'08

Rulings on ZakSh
1. There is n o zaksh d u e o n wealth until one
full year has passed, according to the Islamic calendar
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) stated that the passing of one
full year is a condition of zak& being obligatory, because it was
narrated from him (&)that he said: "No zak& is due on wealth until

496

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

one full year has passed."109 The passing of a year is one of the
conditions of zakiih being due for cash, livestock and trade goods; it
is not a condition in the case of crops. There is consensus on this
point, and no one differed from that."'

2. The minimum threshold for gold and silver
a n d the rate of z a k a o n them
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi Taih (&)
stated that the
,.
minimum threshold at which zak5.h becomes due is twenty
mithqcilsl" for gold, and no z&& is due on anything less than that.
If there is more than that, then it should be calculated. He said:
"Nothing (no zak2h) is due on anything less than twenty dinars. For
twenty dinars (the zak5.h is) half a dinar, and for forty dinars it is one
dinar, and so on."
He said with regard to the minimum threshold for silver:
"There is no zak2h on less than two hundred dirhams.""3 He also
said: "If it reaches two hundred dirhams, then (the zak5.h is) five
dirhams, and if it is less than two hundred, then nothing is due on it. If
it is more than two hundred, it is to he calculated (at that rate)."l14

3. Minimum threshold for camels and
the rate of zakiih o n them
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&)
. .. said: "For
between five and nine camels, the zak2h is one sheep. If it is one
more, then two sheep are due, up to fourteen camels. If it is one more,
then three sheep are due, up to nineteen camels. If it is one more, then
four sheep are due, up to twenty-four camels. If it is one more, then it
is five sheep.l15 If it is one more, then a female camel in its second
year or a male camel in its third year is due, up to thirty-five camels.
If it is one more, then a female camel in its third year is due, up to
forty-five camels. If it is one more, then a female camel in its fourth
year is due, up to sixty. If it is one more, then two female camels in
their third year are due, up to ninety. If there are many camels, then

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

497

for each fifty, a female camel in its fourth year must be given, and
there should be no joining of separate herds and no separating of
joined herds (as a trick to pay less ~ a k % ) . " " ~

4. Types of crops on which z a E h is d u e
According to 'Ali (&), the types of crops on which zakih is
due are wheat, barley, dates and raisins. That was narrated from him
by Ibn Hazm and others.l17 'Ali (&) said: "Zakih is due on four
things: wheat; if there is no wheat then dates; if there are no dates
then raisins; and if there are no raisins then barley.""8

5. There is n o zak& o n vegetables, huits and honey
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
said: "There is no zakih on
vegetable^.""^ According to another report he said: "There is no
zakib on vegetables and herbs."'20 This is the opinion of the
majority of scholars.121There is no zak% on fruit, according to 'Ali
(&). It was narrated From Abu Ishiq that 'Ali (&) said: "There is
no zakih on apples and the like."122 It was narrated from '&im ibn
Damurah that 'Ali (&) said: "There is no zakzh on vegetables:
herbs, apples and cucumbers."'23 This is the view of all those who
said that the obligation of zak% is limited to the four types of grains.
The evidence for including them under the mling on vegetables is
that they have in common the fact that they do not last and cannot be
stored.lZ4 With regard to the zak& on honey, it is not obligatory
according to 'Ali (&), as he said: "There is no zakih on honey ."lZ5

6. Giving zakzh t o one category of recipients only
It is permissible to give zak2h to only one of the eight
categories of eligible recipients or to only one person, according to
'Ali (&). He said: "There is nothing wrong with a man sending
zakih to one category of recipients."'26 It was narrated from him that
zakih was brought to him, and he sent it to the members of one
household.'27

498

Financial and judiciary instilntions at the time of 'Ali

7. Giving zaksh t o one's parents or children
Amir al-Mu'miueen 'Ali (&) said: "Neither the son nor the
father has any right to obligatory charity. Whoever has a son or father
and does not take care of bim is a sinner."lZ8 It was narrated that
there was scholarly consensus on this point; those who disagreed
with it interpreted it as referring to voluntary charity. Their argument
was that the benefit of that comes back to the giver of the zakih,
because he no longer needs to spend on them or give anything to
them, and that may be a trick to avoid giving zakih. Moreover, zakih
and maintenance are two separate duties, and one cannot take the
place of the other, as'with prayer and fasting. Zak& is a duty towards
Allah (B),
so it is an act of worship. As for spending on maintenance,
it is a duty towards people and upholding the ties of kinship.lZ9

Rulings on fasting
1. The beginning of the Ramadan fast may be confinned
with moon sighting by one witness of good character
The beginning of the month of Ramadan may, according to
Amir al-Mu'mineeu 'Ali ibn Abi T%lib(&), be confirmed with the
report of one witness of good character, whereupon the people are
obliged to fast. It was narrated from FZtimah hint al-Husayn that a
man bore witness before 'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib (&) that he had seen the
new moon of Ramadan, so he fasted, and "I (the narrator) think he
said: and he ordered the people to fast."13' This ruling is based on
what is proven from the Messenger of Allah (&): "Fast when you see
it, and break the fast when you see it. Lf it is cloudy, then reckon the
month of ~ha'biin'~'as thirty days."132
An-Nawawi said: "What is meant is sighting (of the moon) by
some of the Muslims. It is not essential for it to be sighted by
everyone; rather it is sufficient for all people if it is seen by two men
of good character, or by one man of good character according to the

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

499

more correct opinion. With regard to the breaking of the fast, the
testimony of one man of good character of having seen the new moon
of ~ h a w w 2 l 'is~ ~not sufficient, according to all scholars except
Thawr, who said that the testimony of one man of good character is
acceptable in this case."'34

2. Fasting of one w h o is in a state of
ritual impurity d u e to sexual activity or emission
Fasting is permissible for one who is in a state of ritual
impurity due to sexual activity or emission. According to 'Ali (&).
he may delay doing ghusl until morning, then he should do it and
complete his fast. That was narrated from him by Ibn Q u d h a h . It
was also narrated from al-Hikith that 'Ali (&) said: "If morning
comes, and a man is in a state of ritual impurity due to sexual activity
or emission, but he wants to fast, let him fast if he wi~hes."'~'The
evidence for this is the report narrated from the Mothers of the
Believers 'A'ishah and Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with
them both), saying that dawn would come when the Messenger of
Allah (g)
was in this state following relations with his wife, and he
would do ghusl and fast.'36

3. Not fasting for one w h o is elderly
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said, commenting on the verse
(And as for those who can fast with difficulty, [e.g. an old man], they
have [a choice either to fast or] to feed a Miskeen [poor person] [for
every day]) (Qur'an 2: 184). The old man who cannot fast may not
fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day.13'

4. The status of i'tikrif 138
It was narrated from Abu 'Abdur-Remb as-Sulami that 'Ali
(&) said: '"There is no iCtik2fexcept in the mosque in which prayers
are held in ~ongregation."'~~
According to another version: "There is
no i'tik2f except in the main mosque of the city."140 Perhaps what he

500

Financial and judiciary instie~tionsat the time of 'Ali

meant by that was that i'tikif should not be done except in the main
mosque of the city, in which the Friday congregational prayer is
held.14'

5. What is permissible for the one w h o is observing i'tikif
'Ali (&) said: "When a man is observing i'tikif, let him
attend the Friday congregational prayer, visit the sick, attend funerals
and go to his family and tell them what he needs while he is
standing."14z

Rulings on Hajj
1. Pilgrim in i b 2 m kissing his wife
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Aliibn Abi Tilib (4)
said: "Whoever
kisses his wife while he is in i b i m , let him offer a sacrifice."143

2. Pilgrim in &rSm killing a threatening animal
It was narrated from M u j a i d from 'Ali (&) with regard to a
hyena that attacks a pilgrim in ilgim, that he may kill it. If he kills it
before it attacks him, though, he must sacrifice a sheep.'44 The
evidence for that is the verse in which AUah (g)
says: @ut if one is
forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing
due limits, then there is no sin on him# (Qur'an 2: 173).This applies to
a situation where he is forced by necessity because if he did not kill it,
it would kill him. Moreover, when it attacked him, it became a
dangerous animal, thus it is included in the category of harmful
animals that may be ki11ed.l~~

3. Killing crows
'Ali (&) said: "The pilgrim in i h r k may kill crows."'46 The
evidence for that is that the Messenger of Allah (ggJ said: "Five kinds
of vermin may be killed in the sanctuary: mice, scorpions, cmws,
kites and vicious dogs."'47

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

501

4. Uncertainty in t a w 3
'Ali (&) said: "If you circumambulate the House and do not
know whether you have completed it or not, add what you are unsure
of, for Allah (&) will not punish yon for doing extra."148

5. Forgetfulness in t a w 3
If a man forgets and does a circuit more than what is
prescribed, he should add more so as to make it two complete tawifs,
according to 'Ali (&). 'Ali (&) said, concerning a man who forgot
and did eight circuits: "Let him add six more, so that it will be
fourteen, then let him pray four r a k a ' a h ~ . " ' ~ ~

6. Delegating Hajj
If a person can afford to do hajj but is unable to do it physically
because he is old or sick, he must delegate someone to go on his
behalf, according to 'Ali (&). That was narrated from him by Ibn
Hazm and others.150Concerning the old man, he said that he should
give another man enough to cover the expenses of hajj and let him do
hajj on his behalf.15' The evidence for that is the report narrated by
Ibn 'Abbb, according to which a woman from Khath'am said: "0
Messenger of Allah (g),
my father is an old man, and he still has to
perfonn the obligation of hajj, but he cannot sit up straight on the
back of his camel." The Prophet (&) said: "Perfonn hajj on his
behalf."15z This indicates that being fmancially able to afford it is
sufficient to make it obligatoly to do hajj for one who is accountable,
according to 'Ali and those who were with him. As for being
physically able, it is sufficient if he is able by means of another
person, whether on the basis of paying his expenses or hiring him or
by other means.153

7. Uncertainty as to the number of stones thrown
If the pilgrim is unceaain as to the number of stones thrown
during the symbolic stoning of the devil, he should repeat what he is

502

Financial and judicialy institutions at the time of 'Ali

unsure of, according to 'Ali (4).
It was narrated from Abu Majlaz
that a man asked Ibn 'Umar: "I stoned the devil, and I do not know
whether I threw six or seven." Ibn 'Umar told him: "Go to that man,"
meaning 'Ali (4).
The man went and asked him, and 'Ali said: "As
for me, if I do that in my prayer, I repeat my prayer." The man came
and told him that, and he said: "He is right." The Shaykh said: "It is
as if he meant, and Allah knows best, that he should repeat what he is
not sure of; so similarly in stoning the devil, he should repeat what he
is not sure of."'54

Other d i n g s
1. Catching up with the
dying animal before it dies

K one catches up with an animal that is about to die, shortly
before it does die, and slaughters it, it is permissible to eat it. The
minimum sign that it was alive before being slaughtered is if one limb
was seen to move, according to 'Ali
He said: "If you find an
animal that has been killed by strangling, a violent Mow, a headlong
fall, or by the goring of homs, or that which has been (partly) eaten
by a wild animal, but you see it moving a foreleg or hind leg, then
slaughter it and eat."'56 The evidence for that is the verse in which
AUah (s)says: (Forbidden to you [for food] are: al-Maitah [the
dead animals, cattle or beast not slaughtered], blood, the flesh of
swine, and that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned
while slaughtering [that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for
others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols] and that which
has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong
fall, or by the goring of homs and that which has been [partly] eaten
by a wild animal unless you are able to slaughter it [before its death])
(Qur'an 5: 3). The point here is that the phrase Bunless you are able to
slaughter it [before its deathlb is an exception to what comes before

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

503

it, meaning except that which you are able to catch up with and
slaughter (before it dies), in which case it is permissible to eat it.lS7

2. Meat slaughtered by Arab Christians
It is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by Arab
Christians, unlike other Christians, according to 'Ali (&). That was
narrated from him by at-Tabari and others.158It was narrated that
'Ubaydah as-Salm2ni said: "Meat slaughtered by Arab Christians
should not be eaten, because they know nothing of Christianity
except drinking alcohol."L59According to another report: "Do not
eat meat slaughtered by the Christians of Banu Taghlib, because they
do not adhere to anything of Christianity except drinking
alcoh01."'~~
He quoted as evidence for that the fact that they did not
adhere to the teachings of Christianity with regard to commands and
prohibitions, so they were not to be regarded as being Christians.
However, when Allah ($&)permitted eating meat slaughtered
by them, it was a time when the Christians had deviated from the
original teachings of Christianity, whether that was with regard to
doctrines or rulings, and that did not prevent it being made
permissible to eat their meat. This was the view of the majority of the
Companions and jurists.16'

3. Meat slaughtered for glory
It is h a r h to eat meat which was slaughtered for glory,
according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated that alJarood ibn Ahi Sabrah
said: "There was a man from Banu Riy& who was called Ibn
Washeel -and his name was Saeem -who was a prominent poet.
Abu Farazdaq bet him that he could slaughter one hundred of his
camels when they came to the watering place outside Kufab. When
the camels came, they both took their swords and started to slaughter
them. The people came
wanting the meat. 'Ali (&) was in
Kufah, and he came out riding the mule of the Messenger of Allah

504
(

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

) calling: '0 people, do not eat this meat, for they were

slaughtered as a sacrifice for something other than Allah.'" Ibn Hazm
said: The Messenger of Allah (g)said: "May Allah curse the one
who offers a sacrifice to anything other than
The point
here is that the slaughter was for the sake of pride and glory, which
meant that it was sacrificed for something other than Allah ( B )so
, it
was included in what was referred to in this

4. Impurity of the egg inside the dead hen
An egg which is inside a dead hen is impure, according to 'Ali

(4);
it is not permissible to eat it whether the shell has hardened or
not. That was narrated from him by Ibn ~ n d k ~ a h . ' ~ ~

5. Food of the polytheists and Magians other than meat
There is nothing wrong with eating the food of the Magians
and polytheists if it does not contain any meat slaughtered by them,
because the prohibition applies only to meat. Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) said: 'There is nothing wrong with eating the food of the
Magians. It is only meat slaughtered by them that is forbidden."l6'
According to another report: "There is nothing wrong with eating the
bread of the Magians. It is only their meat that is f ~ r b i d d e n . " 'This
~~
is the view of the majority of j~rists.'~'

6. Leaving white hair
It is permissible to leave one's hair white and not change it by
dyeing it with henna and the like, according to 'Ali (4).
That was
narrated from him by Ibn Hajar and others.'69 It was narrated that
ash-Sha'bi said: ''I saw 'Ali with a head of white hair and a white
beard that filled the area between his two s h o u ~ d e r s . " ' ~It~was
narrated from Ahu Ishiq: "I saw 'Ali bald and with a white head and
beard."17' It was narrated from Ibn al-Haneefah that 'Ali (&) dyed
his hair with henna once, then stopped.'72

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

7. Playing with dice a n d playing chess
Playing with dice is h a r k , according to Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&),
,.
who said: "Playing with two burning coals is dearer to me
than playing with two dice."173 He would not greet people who were
playing with dice.'74 The evidence for this prohibition is the words of
- , "Whoever plays with dice, it is as if he
the Messenger of AUah (g):
were dipping his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig."175
Chess is also harim according to 'Ali (&), as was narrated
from him by Ibn ~ u d b a h . He
' ~ used
~ to say concerning chess: "It is
~~
to another report: "It
the gambling of the n o n - A r a b ~ . " ' According
is a kind of gambling." 17' It was narrated that Maysarab ibn Habeeb
said: " 'Ali ibn Abi ?[2lib (&) passed by some people who were
playing chess and said: 'What are these images to which you are (so
assiduously) devoted?'79 Holding a coal until it goes out is better for
him than touching these.""80 It was narrated that 'Ammir ibn Abi
'Ammir said: 'Ali (&) passed by a group of (the tribe) TaymAllah who were playing chess. He stood over them and said: 'Allah
created you for something other than this. By Allah, were it not that it
would set a precedent, I would hit your faces with it."'181 The
evidence for this prohibition is that it is gambling, which is h a r h
according to the Qur'an and by analogy.182
"

8. Temporary (or fixed-term) marriage
said: Ramadan abrogated all
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
other fasts, and temporary marriage was abrogated by divorce, 'iddah
and inheritan~e."~'Ali's evidence for that was the report that he
narrated from the Prophet (g),
that he forbade temporary marriage
and the flesh of domestic donkeys at the time of ~ h a ~ b a r . " ~

9. Marriage without a guardian
It was narrated from Abu Qays al-Awdi that 'Ali (&) used to
say: "If she gets married without the permission of a guardian, then

506

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

he consummates the marriage with her, they are not to be separated,
but if he did not consummate the marriage with her, they should be
separated." lX5

10. Physical defects in the woman
If the man finds out that there is a defect in the woman he
married which makes it difficult for him to stay with her, Amir d Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
. ., said: "If he consummated the marriage with
her, he must pay the mahr, and he is to be given the choice of either
divorcing her or staying with her. If he has not consummated the
marriage with her, they may be separated without any mahr."186

11. Marriage of a eunuch
Amir d-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "It is not permissible for a
eunuch to get married." If he gets married, and the woman did not
know, they should be separated according to 'Ali (&), who said: "It
is not permissible for the eunuch to many a chaste Muslim
woman."'" The evidence for that is that being a eunuch is an offputting defect which makes it difficult or impossible to have
intercourse, so an analogy was drawn with other physical faults
which make it permissible to separate the couple.188

12. One who gets married to two sisters
without knowing that they are sisters
If a man marries a woman then marries another, and later he
finds out that they are sisters, he should be separated from the one he
married last, according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated that Ibn Jurayj
said: "I was told about 'Ali, with regard to a man who married a
woman and consummated the marriage with her, then went to
another city and married a woman and consummated the marriage
with her, then found out that this was the sister of his first wife. He
ruled that he should leave the second one and go back to the first one,
but he should not go back to the first one until the 'iddah of the

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

507

second one was over."189 This 1s the view of the majority of jurists of
different m a d b - h a b ~ . Then
' ~ ~ evidence is that the marriage to the first
woman was valid, whereas the marriage to the second woman was
not valid and did not count.'g1
13. Prohibition o n anal intercourse with one's wife
Anal intercourse with one's wife is h a r h , according to 'Ah
This was narrated from him by Ibn ~ u d h a h . 'It~ was
~
narrated that Abu al-Mu'tamir sald: '"Ali called out from the minbar,
saying: 'Ask me.' A man sad: 'Can one have anal intercourse with
women?' He said: 'You have sunk very low, may Allah (&) bring
you low. Have you not seen that Allah (&) says: (You commit alF6hzshah [sodomy -the worst sin] which none has preceded you in
[committing] it in the 'iilarneen [mankind and jinn]) (Qur'an 29:
28)?"' That was also narrated from Abdullah ibn 'Abbzs, Abdullah
~ b n'Amr and Abn Hurayrah; and it was the view of Sa'eed ibn alMusayyab, Abu Ba?a ibn 'Abdur-R-h,
Muj%id and 'Ihrimah. It
was also the view of Abu Haneefah, ash-Sb%fafa'i,
m a d , the M%lkis
and the Dh&thms (the literalists).lg3The evidence for this prohibition
is the words ofthe Messenger of Allah (g):
"Cursed be the one who
has anal intercourse with his wife."'94 The point here is that
disallowing a thing, and stating that the one who does it is cursed,
indicates that it is
(&).

14. 'Iddah of a pregnant woman whose husband has died
If a woman is pregnant when her husband dies, and she gives
blah before the end of her 'iddah, then according to 'Ali (&) she
should observe 'iddah for the longer period, meaning the 'iddah of
pregnancy, if she does not give birth before the end of the 'iddah of
the widow. However, if she gives birth before that, she should
observe 'iddah for four months and ten days (the 'iddah of the
widow). That was narrated from Ibn Rnshd and others.lg6 It was
narrated that 'Abdur-R&m%nibn Ma'qil said: "I was present when a

508

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time uf 'Ali

man asked 'Ali about a woman whose husband died when she was
pregnant. He said: 'She should observe 'iddah for the longer
period."'197 It was narrated that ash-Sha'bi used to say: "The 'iddah
of the pregnant woman is the longer of the two periods."'98 Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (4)
reconciled the two verses: (And for those who
are pregnant [whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead],
their 'Zddah [prescribed period] is until they lay down their burden)
(Qur'an 65: 4) and (And those of you who die and leave wives behind
them, they [the wives] shall wait [as regards their marriage] for four
months and ten days) (Qur'an 2: 234), because one verse is general in
meaning and the other is more specific, so there is no reason to apply
one to the exclusion of the other. Both should be applied together, so
as to be certain and to reconcile them and avoid contradi~tion.'~~
The more correct view is that her 'iddah ends when her
pregnancy ends, in either case. It is narrated in a sound report from
Abdullah ibn 'Utbah that Subay'ah hint al-Hcth told him that she
was married to Sa'd ibn Khawlah, one of Banu ' h i r ibn Lu'ayy,
who was one of those who had been present at Badr. He died during
the farewell pilgrimage when she was pregnant, and she gave birth
shortly after he died. When her period of post-childbirth bleeding
ended, she adorned herself to receive offers of marriage. Abu asSanibil ibn Ba'kak, a man from Banu 'Abdud-Dk, entered upon her
and said to her: "Why do I see you beautified? Perhaps you are
hoping to get married? By Allah, you will not get married until four
months and ten days have passed!" Subay'ah said: "When he said
that to me, I put on my outer garments in the evening and went to the
Messenger of Allah (gg),and I asked him about that, and he
answered me that my 'iddah had ended when I gave birth, and he told
me to get married if I wanted to."Z00
This is the view of the majority of Muslim scholars. It was said
that there was consensus on this point after this hadith was heard.z01
Al-Sha'bi said: ''I do not believe that 'ALi ibn Abi Tilib (&) said

1

i

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

509

that the 'iddah of a woman whose husband dies is the longer of the
two periods."202 Perhaps 'Ali (&) said that because he had not
heard the hadith of Subay'ah, otherwise he would not have gone
against a proven, sound hadith from the Prophet (g).203

Some rulings having to do with financial dealings
1. Gifts hrom the ruler
Amir al-~u'mineen'Ali (&) said: "There is nothing wrong
with gifts from the ruler, because what he gives you from halil
sources is more than what he gives you from hariim sources."204 He
also said: "Do not ask the ruler for anything. If he gives you
something, then take it, for what is in the public treasury of halil
wealth is more than what is in it of h a r k wealth."205

2. Gifts to u n d o injustice and attain rights
If a person helps someone to attain his rights or to ward off
injustice, it is not permissible for him to accept a gift from the person
he helped or from whom he warded off injustice, according to 'Ali
(&). That was narrated from him by Ibn ~ a z m . " ~

3. Not holding the borrower responsible
for damage done t o a borrowed item
The borrower is not to be held responsible for damage done to
the borrowed item if it was damaged without any abuse or
transgression (on the borrower's part) according to 'Ali (&). 207
(&) said: "The borrower is not to be held responsible for the
borrowed item; rather it was a favour, unless the borrower
overstepped the mark, in which case he is to be held responsible."208

4. Not holding a person responsible
for a n item deposited with him
An item deposited with a person is a trust entrusted to him. If it
is damaged when it is with him, without any betrayal or misconduct

510

Financial and judiciaiy institutions at the time of 'Ali

on his part, then he is not to be held responsible for it according to
'Ali (&). He (&) said: "The borrower or person to whom
something is entrusted is not to be held responsible."z09

5. Selling booty to the disbelievers
If the Muslims capture the wealth of the disbelievers as war
booty, it is not permissible to sell it back to the same disbelievers,
according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated that Umm Moosa said: "A
vessel adorned with gold was brought to 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib; it was
one of the vessels of the Persians. He wanted to break it down and
divide it among the Muslims, hut some of the chieftains said: 'If yon
break it, it will lose its value. We will pay you a good price for it.'
'Ali(&) said: 'I will not return to yon wealth that Allah has taken
away from you.' Then he broke it down and divided it among the
people."21o Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did that so that it would
not remind them of their past glory or bring any benefit back to them.

6. Holding workers responsible
Holding the workers accountable is necessary to protect
people's wealth from heing wasted. Al-Shiitibi said: "The Rightly
Guided Caliphs mled that workers should he held accountable. 'Ali
ibn Abi Taib (&) said: 'This is the only way to protect people's
interest^."'^" One of the aims of Sharia is to protect wealth from
heing wasted.212 In Mrgmnaf 'Abdur-RazzZq it says that 'Ali (&)
held tailors, dyers and workers in similar trades responsible, so as to
protect the people.z13
7. The covenant with dhimmi~,'~~
a n d not
being harsh w h e n collecting the jizyah from them
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Nothing will be accepted
from the polytheists of the Arabs except Islam or the sword. As for
the polytheists of the non-Arabs, jizyah may be taken from them. As
for the People of the Book, both Arabs and non-Arabs, if they refuse

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

511

to become Muslim and ask to be dhimmis, we will accept jizyah from
them."215 It was also narrated from 'Ali (&) that he said: "They
only accepted the covenant of dhimmis so that their wealth would be
like our wealth and their blood would be like our blood."2L6 'Ali
used kindness in the way he took the jizyah, and he was lenient in the
way he calculated it. It was narrated that 'Abdul-Malik ibn 'Umayr
said: "A man from Thaqeef told me: "Ali ibn Abi T2ib employed me
and said: "Do not strike any man with a whip when you are collecting
tax money, do not force them to sell provision or winter garments or
summer garments, do not take blood money that they are collecting
to pay, do not appoint a man for the purpose of pressuring people to
pay money." I said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, then I will come back as
I left." He said: "Even if you come back as you left; we are only
instrncted to take from them what is surplus to their needs." ' "'I7

3.2. Hadd punishments
3.2.1. Punishment of the apostate
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "The apostate is to be
asked to repent three times. If he repents (all is well and good),
otherwise he is to be executed."218The evidence for executing him is
the report narrated by Ibn 'Abbh that the Prophet (g)
said:
"Whoever changes his religion, execute
The evidence for
asking him to repent is the report narrated from Jiibibir ibn Abdullah,
according to which the Messenger of Allah
asked a man who
had apostatised from Islam to repent four times.220

(s)

Two opinions were narrated from 'Ali (&) concerning the
hypocritical heretic who made an outward display of being Muslim
while inwardly concealing disbelief:
(a) When asking an apostate to repent, no differentiation is to be
made between the one who manifests his apostasy openly and a

512

Finuncial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

hypocritical heretic, who makes an outward display of being
Muslim when inwardly he is a disbeliever, if proof of that had
been established against him.'" 'Abdur-Razziq narrated that
Muhammad ibn Ahi Bakr wrote to 'Ali (&) about two Muslims
who became hypocritical heretics, and he wrote back saying: "If
they repent (all well and good); othenvise strike their necks
(execute them). "z22

(b) The one who manifests his apostasy openly should be asked to
repent, whereas the hypocritical heretic should not he asked to
repent. Al-Athram narrated, with his chain of narration going
back to 'Ali (&), that an Arab man who had become Christian
was brought to him. He asked him to repent, but he refused, so
he executed him. Then a group of people who prayed but were
hypocritical heretics were brought to him, and proof was
established against them by witnesses of sound character. They
denied it and said: "We have no religion other than Islam." He
executed them and did not ask them to repent. He said: "Do you
know why I asked the Christian to repent? I asked him to repent
because he showed his religion openly. As for the hypocritical
heretics against whom proof was established, I executed them
because they denied it when proof had been established against
them."223
With regard to a woman who becomes an apostate, two views
were narrated from 'Ali (&) concerning her case:
(a) There is no difference between her and a man with regard to the
ruling that they should be executed. This opinion was also
narrated from Abu Bakr (&), and it was the view of al-Hasan,
az-Zuhri, an-Nakha'i, M w o o l , Hammid, Milik, al-Layth, alAwzTi, ash-Sh2fa'i and ~ s h i ~ . ~ ' ~
(b) A woman is to he enslaved and not executed. This was the view
' ~ Qamah, because Abu Bakr (&) enslaved
of a l - ~ a s a n ~and

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

513

the women and children of Banu Haneefah and gave one of these
women to 'Ali (&), who bore him Muhammad ibn alHanafiyyah. That was done in the presence of the Companions,
and there was no objection, which means that there was
consensus on that.ZZ6The story about 'Ali sending word to Bani
N2jiyah, which we will discuss below, also provides evidence to
support this view. In that case, 'Ali (&) executed the men of
fighting age and took the women and children captive.zz7
Amir al-Mu'mineen executed apostates in different ways
according to the circumstances in each case. One way was to strike
the neck with the sword meheading), as in the response of 'Ali ibn
Abi Taib (&) to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr when he asked him
about two Muslims who had become hypocritical heretics. He said:
"As for the two who have become hypocritical heretics, if they repent
(all is well and good); otherwise strike their necks."228

One of the aims of Sharia is to protect the religion, and
executing the apostate offers protection to people of religious
commitment. We have noted the keenness of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs (may AUah be pleased with them) to implement the rulings
of Allah (g)
with regard to those who follow whims and desires and
those who oppose or rebel against religion, and to carry out
appropriate punishments on them. One of the most important of these
rulings is fighting against and executing the apostates. The Rightly
Guided Caliphs did this, implementing the words of the Messenger of
"...it is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who
Allah (g):
bears witness that there is no god except Allah, except in three cases:
the married adulterer, a life for a life and the one who gives up his
religion and forsakes the main body of the ~ u s l i r n s . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah said: "If the apostate is not executed, then you
will find those who entered religion exiting from it. So executing him
offers prntection to people of religious commitment, and that protects

514

against the undermining of Islam and prevents them from leaving
it,n230

3.2.2. Hadd punishment for zina
3.2.2.a. The story of stoning
Ash-Sha'bi said: "Shur%ah had a husband who was absent in
Syria, and she got pregnant. Her master brought her to Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%h (&) and said: 'This woman
committed adultery and admitted it.' So he gave her one hundred
lashes on Thursday and stoned her on Friday. A hole was dug for her
up to her navel, and I was present, then he said: 'Stoning is a ruling
established by the Messenger of Allah (B).If there is a witness who
accused her, he would be the first one to throw a stone. Since she
admitted it, I will he the first one to stone her.' Then the people
stoned her, and I was among them, and by Allah, I was among those
who killed her." According to the version narrated by Ahmad and
Bukhari, 'Ali (&) said: "I flogged her in accordance with the Book
of Allah (%), and I stoned her in accordance with the ruling of the
Messenger of Allah (&!5)."Z3'This judicial ruling was the personal
view (ijtihgd) of 'ALi (&), and there is a difference of opinion
concerning it among the jurists. The majority are of the view that
lashes and stoning should not be combined.232
According to another report, a hole was dug for her to her
navel, and the people formed a circle around her, but ('Ali) struck
them with his stick and said: "This is not how stoning is done, for if
you do it this way, you will shed one another's blood. Rather you
should form rows as for prayer." Then he said: "0 people, the first of
the people to stone the adulterer should be the ruler, if there was a
confession. If four witnesses testified to adultery, then the first of the
people to stone him or her should he the witnesses who testified to
that, then the ruler, then the people." He threw a stone at her and said
takbeer, then he ordered those in the first row to throw their stones

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

515

and then depart, and it camed on like that, row by row, until they
killed her.Z33
3.2.2.b. Delaying stoning for one who is pregnant
If it is proven that a pregnant woman committed adultery, the
hadd punishment is not to be carried out on her until after she gives
birth, according to 'Ali (&).234 It war narrated from him (&) that
he said: "A servant woman of the Prophet (g)
committed an
iinmoral action, and he oidered me to cany out the hadd punishment
on her. But I found that her postchildbirth bleeding had not yet ended,
so I came and told him, and he said: 'When her postpartnm bleeding
stops, then cany out the hadd punishment. Cany out the hadd
punishment on those whom your right hands possess (meaning slave
women)."'235 'ALi implemented this ruling during his caliphate.
3.2.2.c. A woman who is forced to
commit zina through being raped
There is no hadd punishment for the woman who was forced to
commit zina by being raped, according to 'Ali (&). A woman who
was raped is entitled to a mahr equivalent to that of her peers,z36
whether she is a virgin or has been married before.237
3.2.2.d. Zina in a case where a woman
is forced into it by circumstances
If a woman is forced into committing zina in order to save her
life, and she cannot ward off death except by means of that, the hadd
punishment is waived, according to 'Ali (&).238 According to a
report, a woman came to 'Umar (&) and said: "I committed zina, so
stone me." He sent her away until she had testified four times, then
he ordered that she he stoned. 'Ali (&) said: "0 Amir alMu'mineen, bring her back and ask her why she committed zina.
Perhaps she had a reason." So he brought her back and said: "Why
did you commit zina?" She said: "My f a d y had some camels, and I

51 6

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

took my family's camels out. We had a partner, and he came out with
his camels. I had water with me, but there was no milk in my camels;
our partner brought water, and there was milk in his camels. My
water ran out, and I asked him for water, but he refused to give me
any unless I let him have his way with me. I refused until I almost
died, then I gave him what he wanted." 'Ali (&) said: 'Xllrihu
akbar, if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor
transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him.239I think she has
an excuse."240 So 'Umar (&) gave her something and let her go."1
The jurists mentioned this incident as an example of one who
is forced into zina, and they did not differ concerning the view that
the hadd punishment is to be waived in cases where a woman is
f ~ r c e d . " Physical
~
force, or rape, is different from compulsion; in the
case of compulsion, a person goes ahead with the action by choice. In
the case of rape, the person is forced to do the action by violent
means. This is based on the fact that Allah (&) mentions physical
force separately from compulsion, as in the verses, (And force not
your maids to
(Qur'an 24: 33) and BBU~if one is forced
[compelled] by necessity without wilful disobedience nor
transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him.) (Qur'an 2: 173)
'Ali (&) quoted the second of these verses as evidence. The
point here is that being compelled in order to save one's life means
that the punishment in the hereafter is waived, so waiving the worldly
punishment is more appropriate with regard to sin against AUah (s).
Thus it may be understood that with regard to this case, 'Ali (&)
followed the principle which says that necessity makes what is
forbidden permissible."3
3.2.2.e. Not implementing h a d d punishments
w h e n there is doubt
Hudood punishments should not be carried out when there is
doubt, according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated from ad-D&h& ibn

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

51 7

Muz%im that 'Ali (&j said: "If, with regard to carrying out a hadd
punishment, the story involves 'perhaps' and 'maybe', then the hadd
punishment is to be cancelled."2a4 It was narrated from 'Ali (&)
that a woman came to him and said: "I have committed adultery." He
said: "Perhaps someone came to you when you were sleeping in your
bed, or maybe you were forced to do it?' She said: "I did it willingly
and was not forced." He said: "Perhaps you were raped." She said: "I
was not raped." So he detained her, and after she was released and
her son grew up, he had her flogged."5 Her punishment was flogging
because she was not married.
3.2.2.f. Adultery of the Christian woman
If a Christian woman commits adultery, she should not be
subjected to the hadd punishment. According to 'Ali (&), she
should be handed over to her coreligionists so that they may punish
her in accordance with their religionY6 It was narrated from Qahoos
ibn Mnkhiriq that Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr wrote to 'Ali (&j,
asking him about a Muslim man who committed zina with a Christian
woman. 'Ali (&) wrote back to him: "As for the Muslim, cany out
the hadd punishment on him, and hand over the Christian woman to
~~~
out the hadd punishment for zina is
her c o r e l i g i ~ n i s t s . "Canying
an act of worship and includes purification from sin, and that is not
appropriate for one who is not a Muslim.

3.2.2.g. The h a d d punishment is expiation of sin for the
one o n w h o m it is carried out, according to 'Ali (&)
It was narrated from Abu Layla that a man from Hndhayl,
which is regarded as being from Quraysh, said: "I heard 'Ali (&,&I
say: 'If a person does an evil action and the hadd punishment is
carried out on him, that is expiation.'"248 According to another report
from him: "I was with 'Ali (&)
. . when Shur%ah was stoned. I said:
'She has died in the worst situation.' He struck me with a stick or a
whip that was in his band and hurt me. I said: 'You hurt me.' He said:

518

Financial and judiciary instifurionsat the time of 'Ali

'I meant to hurt you. She will never be asked about this sin of hers
again; it is like a debt that has been paid off. ,,3249 The evidence for
the view of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Ahi Taib (&,) is the hadith
of 'Ubgdah ibn as-Shit: "We were with the Messenger of Allah (@)
in a gathering, and he said: 'Whoever does any of that and is
punished for it, it is an expiation for him; whoever does any of that
and Allah (&) conceals it for him, then it is up to Allah. If He wills,
He will pardon him and if He wills, He will punish him."'250

One of the aims of Sharia is to protect honour and lineage. Not
protecting them results in evils that occur because of neglect and
transgression. The wars, fighting, mischief, mixing of lineage and
stopping of bloodlines that happen as a result of that are well-known,
because the one who commits zina is not seeking progeny; rather he
is seeking immediate pleasure. If there was no chastity or protection,
people would no longer be interested in marriage, immorality would
become widespread, and the crime of zina would become common,
along with what results from it of corruption, ill health, calamities,
disasters and trials. Even if nothing else were narrated concerning
this except the following verse of the Qur'an, that would be
sufficient: (And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a
Frihishah [i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin], and an
evil way that leads one to hell unless Allah forgives him.) (Qur'an 17:
3 ~ ) ' ~ Hence
'
Islam brought binding laws to protect honour and
lineage, and the Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with
them) applied these laws.

3.2.3. The hadd punishment for drinking alcohol
3.2.3.a. Drinking alcohol in Ramadan
It was narrated from 'Ata' from his father that 'Mi (4)
flogged the poet an-NajLhi al-Hikithi, who drank alcohol in
Ramadan. He gave him eighty lashes then detained him. The next

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

51 9

day, he brought h ~ mout and gave him twenty lashes, then he s a d to
him: "I only gave you these twenty lashes because of your lack of
shame before Allah (&) in breaking the fast in am ad an."'^^

3.2.3.b. If death occurs when carrying out
the b d d punishment for drinking alcohol
said: "There is no man on whom
It was narrated that 'Ali (&)
,.
I carry out a hadd punishment and he dies that I feel bad about, except
in the case of alcohol. If he dies, I will pay compensation (blood
money), because the Prophet (@J did not prescribe it."253
The mlings of Islam came to protect the reason and intellect
with which Allah (g)
honoured man, and Islam forbade alcohol,
which takes away man's reason, as Allah (&) says:

$0you who believe! Intoxicants [all kinds of alcoholic drinks], and
gambling, and Al-Anssb [stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc], and
a l - A z l k [arrows for seeking luck or decision] are an abomination of
Satan's handiwork. So avoid [strictly all] that [abomination] in order
that you may be successful. Satan wants only to excite enmity and
hatred between you with intoxicants [alcoholic drinks] and gambling,
and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from as-Salih
[the prayer]. So, will you not then abstain?)
(Qur'an 5: 90-91)
In this regard, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Every intoxicant is
kharn~,'~~
and all khamr is hark."255 Hence it is prescribed to carry
out the hadd punishment on the drunkard, and drugs and relaxants
which affect the soundness of the mind are forbidden.256
Protection of the mind and reason is one of the aims of Sharia.
Protecting them leads to protecting the other necessities of Sharia,
and failing to protect them leads to innumerable evils.257

3.2.4. The hadd punishment for stealing
3.2.4.a. Stipulation that the item should be
in a place where it is usually p u t away
For the hand of the thief to be cut off, it is stipulated that the
stolen property should have been taken from a place where such
items are usually put away, according to 'Ali (A).It was narrated
from Dumayrah that 'Ali (&) said: 'The hand of the thief is not to
be cut off unless he takes the goods from the
3.2.4.b. Theft of items whose
ownership is in doubt
If a thief stole property whose ownership was in doubt, such as
if he has a share in it, his hand is not cut off, according to 'Ali
(&)?59
It was narrated that Zayd ibn Dith2r said: "A man who had
stolen from the one-fifth share of the war booty was brought to 'Ali.
The man said that he had a share in it, so 'Ali did not cut off his
hand." It was also narrated from ash-Sha'bi that 'Ali (4)
used to
say: "The hand of one who steals from the public treasury is not to be
cut off."260

3.2.4.c. Stealing a free person
The person who steals a child who is free should have his hand
cut off, according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated from Ibn Jurayj that
'Ali (&)
cut off the hand of someone who sold a free person, and he
,.
said: "The free person can never be a slave.261A person is more
precious and valuable than property, so it is more appropriate to cut
off the hand with regard to stealing a person."26z
3.2.4.d. A slave stealing from his master
The hand of the slave who steals from his master is not to be
cut off, according to 'Ali (&). It was narrated from al-Hakam that
'Ali (&) said: "If a slave stole from my property, I would not cut off
his hand."263

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

521

3.2.4.e. Proof of theft
It was narrated by Ibn ~ u d h a h ' " that according to Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&), theft is proven by the testimony of two
witnesses or if the thief confesses twice. It was narrated that 'Ikrimah
ibn Kh2lid said: " 'Ali did not cut off the hand of a thief unless
witnesses were brought and gave testimony. In the meantime, he
would detain the accused; if they testified against him, he would cut
off his hand, but if they did not give testimony, he would let him go.
On one occasion, a thief was brought to him, and he imprisoned him
until the next day, when he summoned him and the two witnesses. It
was said that one of the witnesses did not show up, so be let the thief
go and did not cut off his hand."265It was narrated from a l Q h i m ibn
'Abdur-R*m& from his father that a man came to 'Ali and said: "I
have stolen." He rebuked him and reviled him, then he said: "I have
stolen." 'Ali (&) said: "Cut off his hand, for he has testified against
himself twice." And I saw his hand hung from his neck.266
3.2.41. Finding out about the thief
before h e steals
The hand of the thief is not to he cut off if he is caught before
he takes the goods out of the place where they are stored, according
to 'Ali (&). It was narrated from al-Hkith that a man was brought to
'Ali (&)who had broken into a house but he had been caught at that
point, so his band was not cut off.267There is another version of this
report which adds that he was flogged as a disciplinary
punishment.'68
3.2.4.g. Repeated theft
The fust time a person steals, his right hand is to be cut off. If
he steals again, his left foot is to be cut off. Then if he steals a third or
fourth time, he is to be given a disciplinary punishment, but his other
hand and foot are not to be cut off, according to 'Ali (&). That was

522

Financial andjudiciaiy institutions at the time of 'Ali

narrated from him by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.269It was narrated
from Abdullah ibn Salamah that a thief was brought to 'Ali (&), and
he cut off his hand. Then he was brought to him again, and he cut off
his foot. Then he was brought to him again, and he said: "Shall I cut
off his hand? How will he wipe himself (after relieving himself) and
how will he eat?" Then he said: "Shall I cut off his foot? How will he
walk? I feel shy before Allah." Then he had him beaten and flogged
and imprisoned."0 It was narrated that al-Mugheerah and ashSha'bi
said: " 'Ali used to say: If a thief steals several times, I will cut off his
hand and foot; then if he does it again, I will put him in prison."z71
And it was narrated that ash-Sha'hi said: " 'Ali only cut off one hand
and one foot. If the thief stole again after that, he would be
imprisoned and subjected to corporal punishment. And 'Mi used to
say: 'I feel too shy before Allah not to leave him a hand with which to
eat and clean himself (after relieving himself)."'27z

3.2.4.h. Cutting off the hand and hanging it
It is recommended to canterise the arm and to hang the severed
hand from the neck of the person who has been punished, according
to ' ~ l iIt.was
~ narrated
~ ~ from Hajiyyah ibn 'Adiy that 'Mi would
cut off the hand, cauterise the arm and detain the thief. When the
thieves had recovered, he would send for them and bring them out,
then he would say: "Raise your hands to Allah," and they would raise
them. Then he would say: "Who cnt off your hands?" They would
say: 'Ali." He said: "Why?" They said: "Because we stole." And
he would say: "0 Allah, bear witness; O Allah, bear witness."274The
arm was cantensed so as to stop bleeding and so that it would heal
quickly, and for fear of infection that might affect the body and cause
death.275
"

One of the aims of Islamic Sharia is to protect people's wealth,
which is essential to their lives. Islam forbids every means of taking
people's wealth unlawfully; it forbids stealing and imposes the hadd

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

523

punishment on anyone who is proven to have committed this crime.
Allah (s)
says: (And [as for] the male thief and the female thief, cut
off [from the wrist joint] their [right] hands as a recompense for that
which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allah)
(Qur'an 5: 38). The Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased
with them) carried out these d i n g s .

3.3. Just retaliation and bodily hann
Islamic Sharia brought rulings on just retaliation, in order to
protect life and ward off evils that result from widespread h a r h
killing and bloodshed. Allah (&) says:

(0 you who believe! Al-Qi& [the Law of Equality in punishment] is
(Qur'an 2: 178)
prescribed for you in case of murder.)
%4nd there is [a saving ofl life for you in al-Qi& [the Law of
Equality in punishment], 0 men of understanding.# (Qur'an 2: 179)
(And whoever is killed wrongfully [Mazlliman intentionally with
hostility and oppression and not by mistake], We have given his heir
the authority [to demand Qi&, -Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diyah (blood money)]. But let him not exceed
limits in the matter of taking life [i.e. he should not kill except the
killer]. Verily, he is helped [by the Islamic law].) (Qur'an 17: 33)
The following are some issues having to do with the rulings on
murder, retaliation and bodily harm:

3.3.1. When a number of people
take part in the murder
If a group of people take part in murdering a person, then they
are all to be executed for it, according to 'Ali (&).276 It was narrated

that he executed three people who killed one man?77

3.3.2. One who orders his slave to kill someone
If a master orders his slave to kill a man and the slave does so,
then the master is to be executed and the slave is to be imprisoned,
according to 'Ali (&). That was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir and
others?" It was narrated from KhallL that a man ordered his slave to
kill a man, and 'Ali (&) said: "He (the slave) is like his whip or his
According to another report: ''If a man orders his slave to
kill a man, he is like his sword or his whip; the master is to be

3.3.3. One who was killed because of crowding
If a person is killed because of crowding, and it is not known
who killed h i , his compensation is to be paid from the public
treasury of the Muslims, according to 'Ali (&).''I
It was narrated
from Yazeed ibn Madhkoor al-Hamadst that a man was killed in the
mosque on Friday when it was crowded, and 'Ali (&) paid his
indemnity from the public treasury?"

3.3.4. Damage caused by one who is driving,
leading or riding an animal
There are two reports from 'Ali (&) with regard to this issue.
The first report says that the one who is driving, leading or riding an
animal is liable if the animal steps on or kicks someone or something;
he blamed the person for negligence, not being careful and not
paying attention.283It was narrated from Khallh that 'Ali (&) held
accountable the one who was leading, driving or riding the animal.284
The evidence be gave is that the one who is riding is directly
responsible for the damage because the animal is like a tool in his
hand. As for the ones who were driving or leading an animal, they are

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

525

the cause and are liahle because they did not take care to avoid
causing bodily harm when driving or leading.285
The second report says that they are not held accountable if it
is proven that they were not negligent, as it was narrated that 'Ali
(&) said: "If he shouted out to people to give way, and made people
hear him, then he is not
It was also narrated that he said:
"If the road was wide, then he is not liable."287The evidence is that if
the road was wide, and he shouted to alert passers-by, then he was
taking precautions and being careful. If the passers-by did not pay
attention to that, then it is their fault; if they were harmed, then they
brought it upon themselves, so there is no protection for them. There
is no contradiction between the two reports, because the first report
refers to a case in which it is proven that there was negligence, and
the second report refers to a case where there was no negligence.288
The burden of proof of negligence is on the passersby.

3.3.5. Whatever is established unlawfully
and causes damage
If a person digs a well or lays something down or builds
something in a place where he has no right to do that, and it causes
damage to someone, such as if that person falls into a well or
stumbles over what he lay down and dies, then he is liable, according
to 'Ali (&)289 who said: "If a person digs a well or lays down a
beam and someone gets hurt, then he is liable."290

3.3.6. Errors in testimony
If there is an error in testimony, then the witness is liable,
according to 'Ali
He said that if a person mistakenly gives
wrong testimony in a case involving a hadd punishment or
retaliation, and it leads to loss of life or limb, then he is liable and
must pay compensation.291It was narrated from 'Ali (&), via a
number of chaius of narration, that two men testified that a man had

(4).

526

Financial andjudiciay institutions at the time of 'Ali

stolen something, so 'Ali (&) cut off his hand. The next day,
another man was brought, and they said: "We made a mistake with
the first man. Tnis is the one who did it." He regarded their testimony
against the second man as invalid, and he penalised them by making
them pay the compensation for the first man.z92The reason for that is
that they caused loss of limb, and the fact that they caused it dictated
that they were liable, like one who digs a well in the road?93
According to another report, he said: "If you had done that
deliberately, I would have cut off your hands."

3.3.7. When a number of people kill
one another by mistake
If a number of people kill one another by mistake,
responsibility for the harm caused is shared among all of them, each
one according to his actions, taking out what the deceased brought
upon himself?94 It was narrated that Khallb said: "A man hired four
men to dig a ditch for him; they dug it, then it collapsed on them, and
one of them died. The case was referred to 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&),
and be imposed three-quarters of the indemnity on them, taking out
one-quarter of it."295

3.3.8. One who employs a minor or
a slave without permission
If a person employs a minor without the permission of his
guardian, or a slave without the permission of his master, to do some
task, or he makes him ride a mount, and he dies as a result of that,
then he is liable, according to 'Ali
It was narrated that alHakam said: "Ali (&) said: 'The one who employs the slave of
some people, whether he is old or young, is liable."'296 He (&) also
said: "Whoever seeks the help of a child who is free is liable, but
whoever seeks the help of an adult is not

3.3.9. Non-physical actions
Non-physical actions, such as scaring or temfyimg a person
and the like, incur criminal responsibility if they result in death or
h m to a person, according to ' ~ l iIt .was

~ ~
that Ibn Jurayj
said: "I said to 'Ata': 'A man called out to a boy who was standing on
a wall, saying that he should move back, and the boy fell and died.'
He said: 'They narrated that 'Ali (&) said: "He is to be held liable.
He scared him.""'299 Holding a person accountable for non-physical
actions in general is the opinion of the majority of scholars.300

3.3.10. Harm caused by doctors
If a doctor or veterinarian does something that is contraty to
treatment methods and causes harm to a person or animal, he is
liable.301It was narrated that ad-D&% ibn Muz%im said: 'Ali
(&) addressed the people and said: '0 veterinarians and doctors,
whoever among you treats a sick person or an animal, let h i take
steps to prove his innocence. If he treats something without covering
himself and causes damage, then he is liable."'302 It was narrated
from Mujihid that 'Ali (&)
, ..
said concerning doctors: "If he (the
doctor) does not bring witnesses to what he is treating, then he has no
one to blame but himself." Then he said: "He is liable."303
"

3.3.11. One who dies as a result of
just retaliation or hadd punishment
If a $add punishment or retaliation is canied out on one who
deserves it, and he dies, there is no liability on the one who carried it
out, according to 'Ali (&3,).304 He (&) said: "If a person dies as a
result of retaliation that was in accordance with the Book of Allah
(&),there is no compensation for him."305 He said: "The one who
dies as a result of a hadd punishment was only killed by the hadd

528

Financial and judiciaiy institutions at the time of 'Ali

punishment."306 He also said: "If a hadd punishment is carried out on
a man for zina, theft or slander, and he dies, there is no compensation
for him."307 The evidence is that retaliation is obligatory, and that
which is obligatory has no guarantee of safety, so there is no liability
in carrying it out as long as there is no shortcoming or negligence.308

3.3.12. The bandit who is caught
If he did not take any wealth or kill anyone, he is to be detained
until he repents. K he took wealth but did not kill anyone, his hand
and foot on opposite sides are to be cut off. If he took wealth and
killed someone, his hand and foot on opposite sides are to be cut off,
then be should be cmciiied until he dies. If he repents before he is
caught, he is liable for the wealth and is subject to retaliation, but he
is not subjected to the hadd punishment.309
Al-UZth ibn Badr, who was a bandit, repented before he was
caught. Because of that, 'Ali (4)
accepted his repentance and
waived the $add punishment for banditry.310

3.3.13. If a killer confesses so as to prevent
an innocent person being accused
A man was brought to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) from a
mined place. He had been found holding a knife that was dripping
with blood, standing before a slain person who was lying in a pool of
blood. 'Ali (&) asked him, and he said: "I killed him." 'Ali (&)
said: "Take him and execute him." When he was taken away, a man
came mshing in and said: "0 people, do not be hasty; take him back
to 'Ali (&)." So they took him back, and the second man said: "0
Amir al-Mu'mineen, this is not the one who did it. I killed him." 'Ali
(A)said to the first man: "What made you say that you killed him
when you did not kill him?, He said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, what
else could I do when the policeman found the man lying in a pool of

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

529

blood, and I was standing before him with a knife in my hand, on
which there was blood, and I was captured in those ruins? I was
afraid that it would not be accepted from me and that you would
make me swear, so I admitted to something that I did not do and I
sought reward with Allah (&)."
'Ali (&) said: "What a bad thing you have done. What really
happened?" He said: "I am a butcher, and I came out of my shop in
the dark and slaughtered a cow and skinned it. While I was skinning
it, with the knife in my hand, I needed to urinate, so I went to the
nearby ruins and entered them to relieve myself. Then I went back
towards my shop and came across this slain man lying in a pool of
blood. I was shocked and stood staring at him, with the knife in my
hand, not realising anything until your policemen came and caught
me. The people said: 'This man killed him, and no one else killed
him.' I was certain that you would not reject what they said and
believe what I said, so I confessed to something that I did 11ot do."
'Ali (&) said to the second man: "What is your story?" He
said: "Iblees tempted me, and I killed the man in order to take his
wealth. Then I heard the sound of the policemen approaching, so I
left the ruins and found this butcher in the state that he described. I
hid from him in the ruins until the policemen came and caught him
and brought him to you. When you ordered that he be executed, I
realised that I would have his blood on my hands too, so I admitted
the truth."
'Ali (&) said to al-Hasan: "What is the ruling on this?" He
said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, he took one life but he saved another,
and Allah (&) says: 4And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he
saved the life of all mankindB (Qur'an 5: 32)." So 'Ali (&) let them
both go, and he paid the indemnity of the slain man from the public
t r e a s u ~ ~ .It~may
" be that he did that after the next of kin of the slain
man waived their right to retaliati~n.~"

3.3.14. A woman who killed her husband
on her wedding day in the presence
of her male friend
At the time of 'Ali (&), a woman killed her husband on her
wedding day in the presence of her male friend, and the punishment
was execution in retaliation for the crime.313

3.3.15. Substituting something else for camels
when paying the compensation for death,
and how it is to be paid
The basic principle is that the compensation for death is to be
paid in the form of camels, but it is permissible to give something else
if camels are not available, according to 'AJi (&). It was narrated
from ' ~ m i that
r 'Ali, Abdullah and Zayd said: "The compensation is
one hundred camels."314 It was narrated from d-Hasan that 'Ali
ruled that the compensation should be twelve
referring
to dirham of silver.
In the case of accidental or quasi intentional killing, it is to he
paid by the male relatives of the killer in instabnents over three years,
according to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&).316 The
evidence for that is the report narrated from d-Mugheerah ibn
Shn'bah, who said: "The Messenger of Allah (@) ruled that the
compensation is to be paid by the male relatives."317As for paying it
in instalments, that is because it is a large amount and it is difficult to
pay it all at once. It is divided into instalments paid over three years,
based on the principle of making things easy, which is enjoined in

3.3.17. Compensation for injury to the spine
If the spinal column is broken, causing impotence, the
compensation is the complete amount for a life, according to 'Ali
(&I.
He said: "If the back is broken and impotence is caused, then
compensation for a life is due."3z'

3.3.18. The eye of one who is one-eyed
If a person puts out the eye of a man who is one-eyed, a
complete compensation for a life is due, or the one-eyed man may
retaliate by putting out one of the aggressor's eyes and taking half of
the compensation, according to 'Ali (4).
That was narrated by Ibn

d That~ is because

~ the eye

equivalent to two eyes of a sighted person in terns of vision. Hence
the compensation is to be paid in full for it.323

3.3.19. Compensation for fingers and toes
The compensation for each digit is one-tenth of the amount for
a whole person, according to 'Ali
in other words, ten camels. It
was narrated from 'ASim ibn Damurah that 'Ali (&) said: "For
digits, one-tenth of the compensation for a life."324 According to
another report: "For digits, one-tenth of ~ne-tenth."~'~

3.4. Disciplinary punishments
If the crime did not merit a hadd punishment, Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) used to discipline wrongdoers
and deter people from committing sin by means of disciplinary
punishments. Since disciplinary punishments are not specified, he
tried to make the punishment fit the crime; the worse the crime, the
greater the punishment. The means of punishment used by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib were many, and they varied according
to the nature of the crime and the situation of the

3.4.1. Striking with hands
Once when 'Umar ibn d-Kha@b (&) was circumambulating
the Ka'bah, and 'Ali (4)
was circumambulating with him, a man
came to 'Umar (&) and said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, settle the
score for me with 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib." He said: "What is the issue?'
He said: "He slapped me on the eye." 'Umar (&) stopped and
waited until 'Ali (&) caught up with him, then he said: "Did you
slap this man on the eye, 0 Abu d-Hasan?" He said: "Yes, 0 Amir
d-Mu'mineen." He said: "Why?" He said: "Because I saw him

3.4.2. Lashes fewer than the hadd punishment
This was the most common disciplinary punishment used by
'ALi (&). For example, he flogged an-NajLhi, the poet who drank
alcohol and broke the fast in Ramadan. Then he said to him: "I only
gave you these twenty lashes because of your lack of shame before
Allah in breaking the fast in ama ad an."^^^

3.4.3. Naming and shaming
Sometimes 'Ali ihn Ahi T2ih (&) resorted to naming and
shaming criminals and making the people aware of them, as he did in
the case of one who gave false testimony. This was in the interests of
society, lest he give testimony and cause people's rights to he lost. It
was narrated that 'Ali ihn al-Husayn said: "If 'Ali caught a person
who gave false testimony, he would send him to his tribe and say:
'This man gave false testimony; know him and tell others about him.'
Then he would let him go."329 It was narrated from Zayd ihn 'Ali,
from his father, from his grandfather that when 'Ali ihn Ahi T s i h
(&) caught a man who gave false testimony, he punished him and
paraded him through his neighbourhood to make him known, and he
told people not to ask him for testimony.330

3.4.4. Detention
On occasion, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) punished people
by detaining them. For example, he detained an-NajLhi, the poet
who drank alcohol and broke the fast in ~ a r n a d a n . ~ ~ '

3.4.5. Chaining people up in detention

evildoers in detention, using chains that had locks. He would appoint
someone to release them from their chains on one side at the time of
prayer.332

3.4.6. Dipping in filth

that."333

3.4.7. Execution
According to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T s i b (&), the
disciplinq punishment could reach the level of execution if the
crime was very serious and had a far-reaching impact. One such
crime was fabricating hadiths and attributing them to the Messenger
of Allah &), because this action leads to introducing things into
Islam that are not part of it; this causes people to deviate from the
religion that Allah (g)
chose for them?34 Hence he used to say:
"Whoever tells a lie about the Prophet (B),strike his neck."335

3.4.8. Destroying the tools of crime
and whatever is connected to it
It was narrated that Rabee'ah ibn Zakkir said: "Ali ibn Abi

said: 'It is a village called ~ u r i r a hMeat

alcohol is sold there.' He got up and went there, bringing fire and
said: 'Set fire to it, and let evil consume itself.' So it was
In
this village, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) burned the
alcohol and everything that had to do with it of raw materials and the
tools that were used to make it?38
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) bad an impact on judicial
institutions through his ijtihsd in the fields of retaliation, hadd
punishments, liability and disciplinary punishments. He also played a
role in developing the schools of Islamic jurisprudence through his
ijtihsd, which is indicative of his vast and abundant knowledge and
his deep understanding of the noble aims of Sharia.

4. Regarding the opinions
of the Companions and
Rightly Guided caliphs
as Sharia evidence
The scholars in the field of principles of Islamic jurisprudence
discussed the views of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them) and said that there are different views as to whether the opinion
of a Companion is binding and may be used as evidence. Ibn alQayyim stated that there was consensus among the four imams that it
may be used as e ~ i d e n c e . 9 ~ ~
The Companions of the Prophet (g),
especially the most
prominent among them, were distinguished by their deep
understanding and knowledge, as Ibn Mas'ood (&) said. They were
the most sincere at heart, the deepest in knowledge, the most
straightforward, the best in guidance and the most dignified of this
Ummah. They are the people whom AUah chose to accompany His
Prophet
and establish His religion, so we should acknowledge
their virtue and follow in their footsteps, for they were on the right
path?40 The relevant point here is his saying that they were the
deepest in knowledge of this Ummah and had the most
understanding. Comparing the knowledge of those who came after
them to their knowledge is like comparing the virtue of the two
groups.341Since that is so clear that there is no need to prove it, we
will point out the main means by which Allah ( B )enabled them to
attain this position:

a)

4.0.1. Learning directly from the Prophet (B)
This had an effect on their understanding in a number of ways:

536

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

4.0.1.a. Purity of the source
from which they learned
they
, were
Because they learned directly from the Prophet (g)
learning the revelation fresh, as it was revealed, and they heard the
directly from him. Their knowledge was
words of the Prophet (g)
not contaminated with anything; rather it was pure Qur'an and
Snnnah that was not mixed with people's opinions or the other
elements of knowledge that appeared after the Muslims opened the
doors to them later on, such as philosophy and the like.
4.0.1.b. Precise understanding
Their understanding was precise because their teacher was the
Messenger of Allah (@), the most eloquent and clear in speech and
the most able to explain and teach. Imagine when that was combined
with listening ears, comprehending minds and good nature, as well as
a desire to seek the truth and eagerness to hear it. Undoubtedly that
made them understand what was said to them precisely and in
accordance with what Allah
and His Messenger wanted. This
matter is very clear, because the people during their lifetimes, and
seekers of knowledge when they are pursuing that knowledge, look
for the best of scholars and those who are most able to explain
different issues. How many students have become prominent in their
fields of knowledge by the grace of Allah (%) and by virtue of the
effective teaching of their instructors? We know that no one can ever
reach the level of the Prophet (g)
in his superior way of teaching, or
even reach one-tenth of that. This was the testimony of MuZ2wiyah
ihn al-Hakam (&) when he spoke of how great a teacher the Prophet
(B)
was: "May my father and mother be sacrificed for him. I never
saw a teacher before him or after him who was better in teaching than

(s)

him,x342

II

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

537

4.0.l.c. The certainty of faith that they attained with
regard to what they heard and understood
Their knowledge was based on certainty, whereas the
knowledge of those who came after them was often subject to
speculation.
4.0.1.d. They were able to know the reasons
for Revelation and background to any hadith
They had knowledge of what abrogates and what is abrogated,
which helped them to understand the meanings.
4.0.1.e. They had the opportunity to witness
the actions of the Prophet (g)
The Sunnah explained his words and clarified the verses of the
Qur'an, and by means of his actions, he demonstrated what was
meant.
4.0.1.f. Possibility of asking about anything
that was not clear to them
When they did so, they were able to get an answer.

4.0.2. Their natural understanding
of the Arabic language
They understood the verses of the Qur'an and the hadiths of
the Prophet (@) by virtue of their natural understanding of the
language. They knew the particular meaning of what was said; they
did not need to study grammar and principles of Islamic law, as later
generations did.

4.0.3. Sincerity t o w a r d s AUah (&) a n d piety
Through the blessing of their sincerity, they attained a great
deal of beneficial knowledge within a short period of time. Allah (&)
(Qur'an 2: 282).
says: (So fear Allah, and Allah teaches

538

Financial andjudiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

All the factors outlined above formed a strong basis that
resulted in deep and solid understanding on the part of the
Companions of the Prophet (@). After mentioning their unique
understanding, which resulted from their hearing from the Prophet
(g),
their listening to the narrations of one another and their
knowledge of Arabic in the most perfect manner, Ibn al-Qayyim said:

"If we compare our understanding to theirs, there is no doubt that
they were more sincere at heart, had deeper knowledge, were more
straightforward and were more likely to understand the text more
correctly than we can do, because Allah
blessed them with
smarter minds, more eloquence, deeper knowledge, a more
straightforward approach to the text, proper and quick understanding,
little or no impact from other influences, good intentions and fear of
the Lord. The Arabic language came naturally to them, and the
correct meanings and concepts were instilled in their hearts and
mnds. They had no need to examine the chains of narration and
background of the narrators to see if there were any faults in the
hadith or to assess the quality of the n m t o r s or to e x m n e the
fundamentals of the branches of knowledge and the different views
of the experts on the principles of Islamic law. They had no need of
all of that. For them there were only two steps to follow:

(s)

(i) Allah (&) said such and such, and His Messenger said
such and such.

(ii) What it means is such and such.
They were the most capable of people to go through these two steps
easily, and they were the most qualified because all of their energy,
knowledge and quality was focused on these two things only. In
comparison, the energies and focus of the later scholars were
scattered. Studying the Arabic language and matters connected to it
took up a great deal of their intellectual efforts. Understanding the
fundamentals of different branches of knowledge took up fnrther

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

539

efforts, and knowledge of the chains of narration and the
backgrounds of the narrators took up even more, as did their focus on
examining the books of the shaykhs from whom they were learning,
of whom there were many, and what they meant (in their books and
in what they said), and so on. When they reached the point, after all
this effort, of seeking to understand the texts with hearts and minds
that were exhausted from examining everything that came before
they were in a position to examine the text, and after they had
expended their energy in studying things other than the text, then
they would understand the text and what it meant with whatever was
left of their energy."343
Thus it becomes clear that the Companions of the Prophet (g)
had deeper knowledge and understanding on the basis of what Allah
(&) granted them of the means to understand and learn. Therefore
they had more knowledge of the aims and goals of Sharia than
anyone else, because one of the most important means of achieving
the aims of Sharia is knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah and the
ways of deriving rulings from them. Undoubtedly this was available
to the Companions in the most perfect manner.344
Ash-Sh2cibi said: "The early generation (as-Salaf) was the
most knowledgeable about the meanings of the ~ u r ' a n . " ~ ~ ~
Concerning the Companions (may AUah be pleased with them), he
said: "They are the example to follow with regard to the way in which
However, the
Sharia and its aims and goals are to be
scholars differed as to whether the view of the Companion may be
regarded as evidence, and there are five well-known views. Before
we mention these views, we will highlight the following points:
1. AU are agreed that the view of a Companion with regard to
issues that are subject to ijtihid is not binding on other
Companions, whether the Companion was a ruler or a
judge or one who gave fatwas.

540

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

2. If the Companion voiced an opinion, and the others agreed
with him, it is not subject to debate because there is
consensus in that case.
3. If he voiced an opinion and it became widespread, and no
one opposed it, then this is regarded as silent consensus.

4. They agreed that the opinion of a Companion is not
binding if another Companion disagreed with him.

5. They agreed that if the opinion of a Companion is based on
the Qur'an or Sunnah or consensus, then it is binding in
that case because of what he referred to.

6 . They agreed that if the Companion recanted his view, it is
no longer binding.
The point of dispute is where the Companion voiced an
opinion concerning an issue that is subject to ijtihid, and we do not
know of anyone who disagreed or agreed, or whether it became
widespread or not, or whether he differed with someone else
concerning this matter or not.347
The scholars differed concerning that, and there are a number
of opinions:

1. The first opinion is that it is binding. This is the view of
Maik and of ash-Shifa'i in his old madh-hab; it is also the
view of *mad according to one report narrated from him.
It is the view of most of the scholars and jurists among the
Hanafis; Ibn 'Aqeel among the Hanbalis; a l - ' ~ l Z ' iand
~~~
al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi among the Shifa'is. It was the
view favoured by Ibn al-Qayyim in I'lcim alMuwaqqi'een, ash-ShZtibi in al-Muwcifaqcit, and Ibn
~ a ~ r n i ~ a h . ~ ~ ~
2. The second opinion is that it is not binding. This is the
view of ashSh2faSi,according to one of his two opinions,

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

and it is favoured by al-Amidi, ar-Rki, al-Ghazgli and
Ahmad, according to one report.350

3. The third opinion is that it is binding if it is a matter in
which there is no room for personal opinion only, and this
is the view of a number of ~ a n a i ' i s . ~ ~ '

4. The fonrth opinion is that only the views of Abn Bakr and
'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) are binding, but
no others.352
5. The fifth opinion is that only the views of the four Rightly
Guided Caliphs - Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmin and 'Ali
(may Allah be pleased with them) - are biding, but no
others.353
The correct opinion - and Allah (&) knows best - is the
first one. The evidence to support that is as follows:

4.1. From the Book of Allah (&)
Allah (%) says: $And the foremost to embrace Islam of the
M u h i j k b and the An& and also those who followed them exactly
[in Faith]. Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased
with Him. He has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow
[paradise], to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.),
(Qur'an 9: 100)

Al-IIiifidh-Ibn Hajar narrated in his commentary on this verse,
with his chain of narration from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi, that
the latter said: " 'Umar ibn al-Khattgb passed by a man who was
reciting the verse, 'And the foremost to embrace Islam of the
Muh2jirzin and the An& ...' When he reached the words 'as they are
well-pleased with Him', 'Umar took hold of his hand and said: 'Who
taught you this? He said: ' 'Ubayy ibn Ka'b.' He said: 'Do not leave

542

Financial and judiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

me until I take you to him.' When he came to him, he said: 'Did you
teach this verse like this to this man? He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Did
you hear it 6.om the Messenger of Allah (g)?'
He said: 'Yes.' He
said: 'I used to think that we (the Muhsjiroon) had been raised to such
a level that no one after us would ever reach.' Ubayy said: 'The
confirmation of this verse appears at the beginning of Soorat alJumu'ah: ( ~ n d[He has sent him (Prophet Muhammad) also to]
others among them ~ u s l i m s who
]
have not yet joined them p u t
they will come]. And He [Allah] is the All-Mighty, the ~ll-Wise)
(Qur'an 62: 3).
.

In Soorat al-Hashr, 4And those who came after them say: Our
Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith,
and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.
Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Mercifulb (Qur'an
59: 10);and in al-Auf2 (And those who believed afterwards, and
emigrated and strove hard along with you [in the Cause of Allah],
they are of you. But kindred by blood are nearer to one another
[regarding inheritance] in the decree ordained by AUah. Verily, Allah
is the All-Knower of everything) (Qur'an 8: 75)."'

(4)

The reason why 'Umar
asked this question is that he
used to recite this verse [at-Tawbah 9: 1001 with the word An5dr-u [as
opposed to Ansdri, which is how Ibn Ka'b recited it], which would
Indicate that the word as-Scibiqoon [foremost] was not connected
only to the word Muhcijijirren. When it became clear to him that
Ubayy ibn Ka'b recited it as An~iki,which would indicate that it was
also included with the word Muhsjueen, he mid: ''I used to think that
we [the Muhijireeu] had been raised to such a level that no one after
us would ever reach -refemng to the Muhqireen. These words of
'Umar's support the view of those who held the first opinion, who
said that the views of all the Companions are binding, without
singling out some of them, because dl of them are praised in the

Xli ibn Abi TZib

543

verse and are described as pioneers ('the foremost') in knowledge,
virtue, jihad and actions. This verse was quoted as evidence by Ibn
al-Qayyim, who counted it as part of the evidence indicating that it is
obligatory to follow the ~ o m ~ a n i o nHe
s . ~narrated
~~
that Imam
M2lik used it as evidence to prove the same point,355and said that
this verse praises the Companions and shows that they are entitled to
be leaders who are taken as an example and whose views are to be
followed. It also praises those who follow all of them or who follow
each one of them, so long as that does not go against any Sharia
text.3j6
Among the evidence for that is the verse in which Allah (%)
says: YOU [ m e believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers
of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever
raised up for mankind; you enjoin al-Ma'roof [i.e. Islamic
Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained] and forbid al-Munkar
[polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden], and you
believe in Allahb (Qurbn 3: 110). In his commentary on this verse,
Ibn Jareer narrated, with his chain of narration from ad-I?ahb%, that
the latter said: "They are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah

was also quoted as
evidence by ash-Shgtibi, when he stated that the way of the
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) is the way to be

He said concerning this verse: "This
affirms the superiority of the Companions over all other nations. That
implies that they were righteous in all situations, and all the affairs of
their lives were based on following the teachings of Islam and not
going against it in any way."360 Imam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyab
discussed in detail the issue of proving that the opinion of the
Companions is binding by quoting these verses, and he highlighted

(s)

544

Financial and judiciary institurions at the time of 'Ali

the way in which the text refers to that. He did a good job and
mentioned many useful points.361

4.2. Evidence from the Sunnah
There is a great deal of evidence from the Sunnah, for example
the words of the Prophet (&): "The best of people is the generation of
whom I am one, then the second generation (after that), then the
thrd.n362 His telling us that implies that they ate the foremost in all
aspects of good deeds, especially with regard to doing and saying the
right things.363They are superior to others in all virtues, such as
knowledge, action, faith, reason, religious commitment, eloquence
and worship, and they are more qualified to understand every
difficult issue. No one could dispute that except one who rejects what
is well established and well known in the religion of ~ s l a r n . ~ ~ ~
According to Abdullah ibn Mas'ood, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "There is no Prophet whom Allah (&) sent to any nation before
me, but he had disciples and co~npanionsfrom among his nation who
followed his path and obeyed his commands."365 Al-Bayhaqi quoted
.
this hadith as evidence of their superiority and high status366 In
knowledge, action and sincerity.367

4.3. Evidence from other reports
It was narrated from Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamh (&) that he
said: "0people, follow the path of those who came before you, for by
Allah (B),if you follow their path, then indeed yon will succeed
tremendously, but if you drift away from it, right or left, ycju will be
greatly misguided."368 Al-Khafeeb narrated with his chain of
narration from 'Lmir ash-Sha'bi that the latter said: "What they
narrate to you from the Companions of Muhammad (@J, accept
it.m369

4.4. Sayings of the imams and scholars
concerning the binding nature
of the Companions' opinions
1. Ash-Sh3aifa'i said: "So long as there is evidence in the Qur'an and
Sunnah, then the excuse for not following then1 is invalid. If we
find no evidence there, then we turn to the opinions of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (@J or of one of
them."370 He also said: "You have no right to give an opinion
unless you base it on a reference point or a valid analogy, and the
reference point is the Qur'an or Sunnab, the words of one of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (gj,
or the consensus of
the people."37'
2. &mad said: "Do not trust any of these people with' regard to
religious matters. Whatever comes from the Prophet (g)
and his
companions, follow it; then with regard to those who came after
them (the Tshi'oon), the matter is broad in
3.

The opinion of Imam M%ik with regard to the actions of the
people of Madinah is well known, but he went fnrther than that
and regarded the opinions of the Companions, especially the
caliphs who came after the Prophet (Blessings and peace be
upon him), as binding.373

4.

Ibn Taymiyah said: "Those among these scholars who said that
the opinion of a Companion is binding meant that this applies as
long as there is no other Companion who gave a different view,
and no text to the contrary is known. Moreover, if it became
widely known, and no one objected to it, that may be regarded as
approval for this opinion. So if it is known that they approved it
and no one objected to it, it may be said that this is consensus by
approval, because they do not approve of falsehood.374But if the
opinion did not become widely known, or if it is known that

546

Financial and jlldiciary institutions at the time of 'Ali

someone disagreed with it, then it is not binding and does not
count as evidence, according to consensus."375

5. Ash-Sh2ebi said, in his commentary on the words of the Prophet
'the path upon which I and my Companions are':376'This

(a),

refers to what they said and did and the views they worked out.
All of that is binding in general, and this is based on the
testimony of the Messenger of Allah (@)for themin particular...
So everything they said and did is something to he followed,
without anyone else sharing this virtue, unlike others."377 He
also said in al-Muw6fuq2t: "The way of the Companions (may
Allah be pleased with them) is a way to be followed and referred
to,s378

CHAPTER FIVE
Governors at the time of Amir aleen 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&)

1. Regions of the state
1.1.Makkah al-Mukarramah
w h e n 'Uthm2n (&) died, the governor of Makkah was
K h a d ibn Sa'eed ibn al-'is. 'Ali (&) issued a decree dismissing
him, and he appointed Abu Qat2dah al-An& as governor of
Makkah.' It seems that his goveniorship only lasted a short time,
because when 'Ali (&) wanted to leave Madinah and go to Iraq, he
dismissed Abu Qatiidah and sent Qatham ibn al-'~bb%' to be the
. ~ the governorship of Abu Qatiidah lasted
governor of ~ a k k a hThus
approximately two months, and not much is narrated concerning that
period. Most of the sources that speak about the governorship of
Qatham ibn al-'Abbk over Makkah mention that 'Ali (&)
appointed h
i
m as governor of Makkah, at-Ti'if and the surrounding
regions at the same time.4
The reports that were narrated about Malikah during 'Ali's
caliphate have to do with hajj and who was in charge of the
pilgrimage. There is no report that 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib (&) attended
hajj during his caliphate, because he was preoccupied with the
t~nmoilthat had broken out throughout the Islamic State, and this
situation had not settled down. During the hajj season, he would send

548

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Ta^lib

someone to lead the pilgrims. It seems that Qatham ibn alLCAbbhled
the people in hajj in the year 37 AH only. 'Ali (&) sent Abdullah
ibn 'Abb2s to lead the pilgrims in 36 AH and 'Ubaydull2h ibn al'Abbss in 38 AH, although the sources differ concerning the year in
which each of them made the pilgrimage.

In 39 AH, he sent Mu'swiyah, one of his commanders in
Syria, with the pilgrims froni Syria and told him to lead the people in
hajj. When he reached Makkah, he had a dispute with Qatham ibn
'Abbis. Fighting would have broken out, were it not for the efforts of
some of the Companions to bring about reconciliation between them
on the basis that hajj would be led by one of Banu Shaybah. Thus the
pilgrimage ended peacefully and no fighting o c c ~ n e d . ~
Qatham ibn al-'Abbk remained the governor of Makkah until
the arrival of MuC2wiyah'sarmy, led by Bisr ibn Art&, whereupon
he fled, fearing for his lie. Thus Qatham's governorship ended and
Makkah was no longer under the authority of 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
(4).
'Ali (&) sent some troops to recapture Makkah, but he (&)
was martyred before the mission could be a~complished.~

1.2. Madinah
During the time of the Messenger of Allah (&) and the three
caliphs who succeeded him, Madinah was the capital of the Islamic
state. The leader of the Muslims lived there and ran its affairs
himsell; when he travelled, he would appoint someone to run its
affairs.
However, this situation changed after allegiance was sworn to
'Ali (&) as caliph. The general state of confusion after themurder of
'Uthmk (&)meant that 'Ali (&)had to leave Madinah, especially
after Talhah, az-Zubayr and 'pishah left and headed towards Iraq
appointed Sahl ibn Haneef
before the Battle of the camel." 'Ali (d)

'Aliibn Abi Ta^lib

549

al-An@ in charge of Madinah, according to some reports,' but we
do not know how long Ibn Haneef remained in that position. It seems
that his governorship lasted for more than one year, since it was
narrated that he was in charge of Madinah in 37 AH.^ After
dismissing Sahl ibn Haneef, 'Ali (&) appointed T a m h ibn al'AbbG. Later, he appointed Abu Ayyoob al-An& and he remained
the govemor of Madinah until 40 AH, when an anny sent from Syria
by Mu'iwiyah and led by Bisr ibn Art& arrived in Madinah." Abn
Ayyoob fled from Madinah and went to join 'Ali (&) in ~ u f a h . "
Thus Madinah slipped from the control of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&)
and came under the control of Mu'iwiyah. So at the time of ' ~ l i
(&), Madinah changed from being the seat of the caliphate to being
one of the provinces, and political events began to take place far
away from it. Hence we find that the historical sources ignored it
during that period, until Mu'Zwiyah's army managed to capture it."

1.3. Bahrain and Oman
When 'Uthmin (&) was martyred, Bahrain belonged to the
emirate of Basra, and 1 b n . ' k r used to appoint some of his workers
to govern it. While 'Ali (&) was the caliph, he appointed a number
of governors in charge of Bahrain, one of the most important of
whom was 'Umar ibn Abi Salamah.I3 He set out from Madinah with
'Ali (*) during his journey to Iraq, then 'Ali (&) sent him to
govem I3ahrainI4 for a period of time. Later, he was summoned to
accompany 'Ali in Iraq. Other employees of 'Ah in Bahrain were
Qudiimah ibn al-'Ajlsn a l - ~ n ~ 2 rand
i ' ~an-Nu'& ibn al-'Ajlk alAns%.'"~li
also appointed 'Uhaydull2h ibn 'AbbL to govem
Bahrain;" he was the govemor of Yemen, so perhaps Bahrain and
Najd also came under his governorship at that time. This may be
understood from what at-Tabar2ni said, and what Khaleefah ibn
Khayyit said may be understood on the basis that he did not know

550

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

The sources mention the
about the correct order of these
names of some men whom 'Ali (&) sent to Oman, one as a
governor and the other as the commander of troops to suppress one of
the rebellions that were launched against 'Ali (&) in oman.'' There
' ~ it may be that he was
was also a man in charge of a l - ~ a m h a h , and
working under the governor of ahr rain.^'

1.4. Yemen
When 'Uthmk (&) was martyred and allegiance was swom
. . as caliph, he appointed 'Ubaydnllih ibn al-'Abbk (&)
to 'Ali (&)
as governor of yemen." 'Uthmrin's governors left Yemen before
'Ubaydulla ibn 'AbbL got there; some of them joined Talhah and
az-Zubayr in the army of the Battle of the Camel, and they played a
role in equipping their army.23 'Ubaydulla ibn 'Abb2s was the
governor of San'2 and its surrounding areas, and his fellow governor
was Sa'eed ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubikhh a l - ~ n ~ %
who
~ ~was
, in charge of
the ~ I O O ~ S ? ~
The murder of 'Uthmk (&) had a far-reaching effect on the
Muslims in Yemen, who felt disappointed and upset by this crime.
Some of the Yemenis did not swear allegiance to 'Ali (&)-&d
wanted to kill the killers of 'Uthmin (&). When that was delayed;
they corresponded with Mu'iwiyah after the arbitration, and he sent
Bisr ibn AGa'ah, who managed to gain control over Yemen with their
help. This only lasted for a short time, though,z6 before 'Mi (&)
managed to take it back fmm the army of Mu'iwiyah and restore
'Ubaydull2h ibn 'Abb2s as its governor once again. He remained in
that position until Amir al-Mu'mheen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&) was
martyred.z7
It was narrated that Bisr killed two sons of 'Ubaydull2h ibn
'Abbb and some of the supporters of 'Ali (&) in Yemen, then be
went back to Syria. Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) had sent JCiyah

,

'Ali ibn Abi TJlib

551

ibn Q u d h a h as-Sa'di, it was said that he did the same as Bisr had
done, and he killed some of the supporters of 'Uthmk (&) in
erne en.^^ Ibn Katheer said: "This report is well known to the
biographers, but there is some doubt as to its soundness."29
Undoubtedly, the killing of innocent people was not the norm at that
time, even in the battles of the Camel and Siffeen, when fighting
broke out between the two sides. How could children and innocent
people be killed at the time of truce? Hence we cannot accept these
stories that are contrary to Muslim customs, values and religion.30

1.5. Syria
Mu'Zwiyah (&) was governor of Syria during the caliphates
of 'Umar and ' ~ t h m &(may Allah be pleased with them both). When
'Ali (&) was appointed as caliph, he wanted to dismiss him and
appoin&bdullah ibn 'Umar instead, but Abdnllah ibn 'Umar refused
to accept the governorship of Syria. He gave his apologies,
mentioning the close ties of kinship and marriage that existed
between them.31Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) respected his wishes
and did not force him to go to Syria. As for the reports claiming that
'Ali (&) reviled or insulted Abdullah ihn 'Umar (&) for adopting a
neutral stance instead of taking his side, they represent a distortion of
the facts and seem to be blatant lies3'

'

The most that can be said concerning the issue of Abdullah ibn
'Unlar and the governorship of Syria is that which was narrated by
adh-Dhahabi via SufyZn ibn 'Uyaynah from 'Umar ihn NZ' from
his father that lbn 'Umar said: "Ali sent for me and said: '0 Abu
'Abdur-R&rnh, you are a man whom the people of Syria would
obey, so go there, for I have appointed you over them.' I said: 'I urge
you by Allah, and by my ties of companionship to the Messenger of
Allah, to let me off.' 'Ali (&) refused, so I sought the help of
HafSah, but still he refused. So I departed at night for ~ a k k a h . " ~ ~

552

Governors ut the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tirlla

This offers definitive evidence that Ibn 'Umar had sworn allegiance
to 'Ali (&) and come under his authority; otherwise how could 'Ali
(&) seek to appoint. h i if he had not sworn allegiance to him?
In Ibn 'Abdul-Ban's al-lsti'cib it is narrated via Ahu Bakr ibn
Abil-Jahm from Ihn 'Umar that he said, when he was dying: "I do not
regret anything except not fighting the transgressors alongside 'Ali
(L&)."~~
This also indicates that he swore allegiance to 'Mi (&),
because he only regretted not going out with 'Ali (&) to fight. He
was one of those who kept away from humoil and did not fight with
anyone. If he had refrained from swearing allegiance, his regret for
that would have been greater, and he would have said that clearly.
The act of swearing allegiance is obligatory, and refraining from it is
threatened with punishment, according to the report of Ibn 'Umar
himself, who said that the Prophet (@,) said: "Whoever dies without
having sworn allegiance has died a death of pre-Islamic
ignorance."35 This is unlike going out to fight alongside 'ALi (&);
the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) differed on this
matter, and some of them kept out of it. So how can it be imagined
that Ibn 'Umar would regret not taking part in this fighting but not
regret not swearing allegiance,' if he did in fact refrain from that
despite the stem warning concerning it? Thus it is clear h a t the claim
of some historians, that Ibn 'Umar did ,lot swear allegiance to 'Ali
(may Allah be pleased with them both), is false. It is proven that he
was one of those who swore allegiance to him. Indeed, he was close
to him, to the point that 'Ali (&)
, .
was keen to appoint him as his
governor and seek his help, because of the sincerity and loyalty he
saw in him.36
After Ibn 'Umar apologised for not accepting the governorship
of Syria, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) sent Sahl ihn Haneef instead.
He had hardly reached the borders of Syria when he was seized by
members of MuZ%wiyah'scavalry, who said to him: "If 'Uthmiin

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

553

(&) has sent you, then you are welcome, but if anyone else has sent

you, then go hack."37 Syria was seething with anger at the unjust and
wrongful murder of 'Uthmin (&). The chemise that was stained
with his blood had reached them, along with the fingers of his wife
Ni'ilah, which had been cut off as she was defending him. This story
of his martyrdom was tenifying and painful; it shook them
emotionally and moved them to tears. They had also heard the news
that the thugs had taken over Madimah and that Banu Umayyah had
fled to Makkah.
All of this, as well as other events and factors, had a strong
effect on the people of Syria and their leader Mu'iwiyah (&). He
said that he had the responsibility of standing up for 'Uthmin (&,)
and wreaking vengeance on his killers, since he was his kinsman, and
Allah (&) says: (And whoever is killed wrongfully [MazlGman
intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake], We
have given his heir the authority [to demand Qiscij, - Law of
Equality in punishment - or to forgive, or to take Diyah (blood
money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life [i.e.
he should not kill except the killer]. Verily, he is helped b y the
Islamic law]) (Qur'an 17: 33). Mu'iwiyah gathered the people
together and addressed them, telling them that 'Uthmin (&) had
been killed unlawfully at the hands of foolish hypocrites whodid not
respect blood that is protected in Sharia; they had shed his blood
during the sacred month in the sacred land.
The people got angry and denounced what had happened, and
their voices became loud. Among them were a number of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (s,).
One of them named
Murrah ibn Ka'b stood up and said: "Were it not for a hadith I heard
from the Messenger of Allah (g),
I would not have spoken. The
Prophet (&) mentioned the &moil and gave some details
concerning it. Then a man passed by whose face was covered with a

cloth, and the Prophet (g,
said:
) 'This man will be following tme
guidance at that time.' I went up to him and found that he was
'Uthmk ibn 'Man. I turned to the Prophet (@) and asked: 'This
man?' He (g)
said:
There is another hadith which played a role in Mu62wiyah's
quest for vengeance for 'Uthmin (4)
and gave him a strong motive
and resolve to achieve this goal. It was narrated from an-Nn'min ibn
Basheer that ' ~ i s h a h
said: "The Messenger of Allah (@) sent
for 'Uthmin ibn ' ~ f f ^ a n . .came,
~ e and the Messenger of Allah (B)
turned to him. The last words he said, when tapping his shoulder,
were: '0 'Uthmzn, Allah may clothe you with a chemise which, if the
hypocrites want you to take it off, do not take it off until you meet
me.' He said it three times." I [an-NuCm2nJsaid to her: "0 Mother of
the Believers, why did you not tell us this before?" She said: "I forgot
it, and by Allah I did not remember it." He said: ''I told Mu'2wiyah
ihn Abi SufySn about it, and he did not l i e what I told him. He wrote
to the Mother of the Believers, asking her to write to him about it, and
she wrote a letter to him about it."39

(a)

(a)

Eagerness to implement the mling of Allah
against the
killers was the main reason for the refusal of the people of Syria, led
by Mn'?iwiyah ibn Ahi Sufyin, to swear allegiance to 'Ali ibn Ahi
Ti%b (&) as caliph. It was not because of MuC?iwiyah'sambition to
remain as governor of Syria or to ask for that which he was not
entitled to, because he understood perfectly that this matter (the
caliphate) was only for those who remained of the six members of the
consultative committee, and that 'Ali (&) was better than him and
more entitled to that position.40 The evidence for that is the report
narrated by Y&ya ibn Sulaymk al-Ja'fi with a good chain of
narration from Abu Muslim al-Khawlhi, who said to Mu'iiwiyah:
"Are you disputing with 'Ali and thinking that you are like him?He
said: "No, by Allah, I h o w that he is better than me and more

'Ali ibn Abi @lib

555

entitled to this matter than me, but do you not h o w that 'Uthm2n
was killed unlawfully and I am his cousin and the one who is seeking
vengeance for his blood? So go to him and tell him: Let him hand
over to me the killers of 'Uthmin, and I will follow him." They went
to 'Ali and spoke to him, but he did not agree to hand them over?'
According to another report, they went and spoke to him, and he said:
"Let him swear allegiance first and leave these people for me to deal
with them," but Mu'iwiyah refused.42
There are reports depicting Mu'iwiyah's refusal to obey as
being because of his ambitions and worldly aspirations, and because
of enmity and competition between Banu HLhim and Banu
Umayyah dating back to pre-Islamic times. In addition, there are
other slanders, fabrications and attempts to undennine the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah be pleased with
them all). Some contemporary writers - such as al-'Aqqid in
'Abqaiiyyat 'Ali and 'Abdul-'Azeez al-Doori in Muqaddimah ji
Tareekh Sadr al-Islam -relied on these reports and based their false
notions on them. The trnth is that all of these reports are worthless,
and their narrators were criticised, either because they were not of
good character or they were confused?3
The province of Syria remained under the control of
Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi S u f y k (&) throughout the caliphate of 'Ali
(&); he was not able to gain control of it or to appoint governors or
commanders over it. There were some clashes in the eastern part of
Syria between the troops of 'Ali (&) and the iroops of Mu'2wiyah
(&). The most significant of these was the battle of Siffeen in 37
AH, at which both 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah (may Allah be pleased with
them both) were present. None of these battles put a stop to
MuC2wiyah's continued domination of ~ y r i a . ~ ~

1.6. Mesopotamia (al-Jazeerah)
Mesopotamia was one of the provinces that belonged to Syria
at the time of 'Uthmk ibn 'AfYan (&). After he was martyred, Syria
was under the control of Mu'iwiy& (A),while Iraq was under the
control of 'Ah(&). This made Mesopotamia an area of dispute
between the two sides, because of its geographical location with its
connection to Syria, on the one hand, and Iraq on the other.45Hence,
it was possible to gain control of it from either side. A number of
battles took place between the troops of 'Ali and the troops of
Mu'iwiyah, as both sides attempted lo conquer the region. 'Ali
managed to gain control of it for a while.46 He appointed al-Ashtar,
the most famous of 'Ali's governors in ~ e s o ~ o t a m iwhom
a ~ ~ , he
appointed to that post more than once. Al-Ashtar managed to put its
affairs in order, but in 38 AH, 'Mi (4)
was forced to transfer him to
Egypt as the governor there.48 Chaos returned to Mesopotamia once
again, and a number of battles took place there as Mu'iwiyah tried to
gain control of it after that.49
It seems that at the end of 39 AH, Mu'iwiyah managed to gain
control over Mesopotamia to some extent.5o It had been a refuge for
some of those who had stayed out of the conflict between 'Ali and
Mu'iwiyah; they did not swear allegiance. to 'Ali while the dispute
was ongoing between him and ~ u ' i w i ~ a Its

armies of Syria which attacked Mesopotamia; in fact, they managed
to attack Syria from the direction of ~ e s o ~ o t a m i a . ~ ~

1.7. Egypt
When 'Uthmk (&) was martyred, the governor of Egypt
was Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfah, who had taken the position by
force and was not approved by 'Uthmiln (&). After the martyrdom
of 'Uthmiin, 'Ali confirmed him as Egypt's governor. Not long after
that, Mu'gwiyah sent an army to Egypt and defeated and captured
Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfah. He was then imprisoned and
executed.54

(4)

It was said that 'Ali
did not appoint Muhammad ibn Ab'i
Hudhayfah as governor of Egypt; rather he left him in his post until
he was killed, whereupon 'Ali (&) appointed Qays ibn Sa'd to take
his place.55 He said to him: "Go to Egypt, for I have appointed you as
its govemor. Go there, and take people whom you trust and love to
accompany you. Take troops with you until you get there, because
that will be more frightening to your enemies and more encouraging
to your followers. When you get there inshallah, be kind to those who
do good, and be harsh towards those who do evil. Be kind to the
common folk and prominent people alike, for kindness is a
blessing."56
Qays's intelligence and good conduct prevailed in a number of
situations. When he set out for Egypt, there was a group there who
was angry ahout the killing of 'Uthmk (&I
and another group who
had taken part in the murder. Qays was met by cavalry from Egypt
before he entered the land. They said: "Who are you?" He said: "I am
one of the supporters of 'Uthmk. I am seeking refuge with some
people so that we can suppoa one another for the s&e of Allah."
They said: "Who are you?" He said: "Qays ibn Sa'd." They said:
"Go ahead." So he went ahead and entered ~

~
The way Qays handled this situation is what enabled him to
enter Egypt. After that he announced that he was an amir (governor).

~

at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

Perhaps if he had announced to the soldiers that he was an amir, they
would have prevented him from entering Egypt in the first place, like
the one whom 'Ali (&) sent to Syria, who was prevented from
entering the country when the Syrian troops realised that he had been
sent by 'Ali (&) as governor of Syria.
When Qays ibn Sa'd reached al-Fuswt, he ascended the
minbar and addressed the people of Egypt. He read to them a letter
from 'Ali ibn Abi T%h (&) and asked them to swear allegiance to
'~li.'' At that point, the people of Egypt divided into two groups;
one group swore allegiance to 'Ali (&) and to Qays, and the other
group stayed away from the issue. Qays ihn Sa'd was wise in dealing
with those who swore allegiance and those who refused. He did not
force them to swear allegiance, and he left them as they were;59 he
even sent their stipends to them in the place where they chose to stay
away from the turmoil. Some of them came to hi,and he honoured
them and treated them kindly.60This good treatment helped to avoid
confrontation with them, and it helped him to calm things down in
Egypt. He appointed senior officials, organised the collection of the
land tax, and appointed men to the police force.61Thus he managed
to put the affairs of Egypt in order and to please all paaies in the
country.62
Qays ibn Sa'd became a political and militaq danger to
Mu'iwiyah ibn Ahi Sufyk in Syria, because Egypt was close to Syria
and because Qays succeeded in putting Egypt's affairs in order and
was well-known for his resolve. Mu'iwiyah was worried about the
military manoeuvres against him that could come out of Egypt. He
began to correspond with Qays ibn Sa'd in Egypt, threatening him
while at the same time trying to tempt him to join him. However,
Qays' response to that was so intelligent that Mu'iwiyah was not able
to determine where Qays stood and what he intended to do, even
though a number of letters were exchanged between them.63 The

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

559

R%@i reports about the letters between Mu'zwiyah and Qays ibn
Sa'd, which were mentionedby Abu Makhnaf, became widely quoted
in the history books, but they are false and are not sound. The only one
who narrated them was this worthless Riifidi, who was regarded as
weak by the scholars who determine who was praiseworthy and who
was unreliable. The texts of these reports also contain odd things,
among the most prominent of which are the following:
1. 'Ali's address to the people of Egypt who were with Qays ibn
Sa'd, in which he (allegedly) said: "Then came after them (Abu
Bakr and 'Umar) a ruler whose conduct was not appropriate, so
the men of the Ummah started showing resentment, then they
got angry with him and changed him." In other words, those
who rebelled against 'Uthmh (&) were the men of the
Ummah, and the Ummah had changed this evil by killing
'Uthrnh. The truth is that 'Ali (&,) is innocent of these words.
He h e w that those who killed 'Uthmk (&) were thugs and
that his slaying was unjust and wrong, and his words reflect that.
Ibn 'Asikikir narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: "I
never heard 'Ali saying anything bad about ' ~ t h r n h . "Al~
H&m and Ibn 'Asikir narrated that 'Ali (&) said: "0Allah, I
declare myself innocent before You of the blood of 'Uthmh. I
felt very distressed the day 'Uthmh was killed, and I was deeply
grieved. They came to me to swear allegiance to me, and I said:
'By Allah, I feel shy before Allah to accept allegiance from
people who killed a man of whom the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Should I not feel shy of one before whom the angels feel
shy?" I feel shy before Allah to accept allegiance when 'Uthmk
is lying slain on the ground and has not been buried yet.' So they
went away, and when he had been buried, the people came back
and asked me to accept their oath of allegiance. I said: '0 Allah,
I am very uncertain of what I am letting myself in for.' Then I
decided to go ahead, and I accepted their oath of allegiance.

560

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

When they said 'Amir al-Mu'mineen', it was as if my heaa was
broken, and my eyes filled with tears."h5 There are many similar
reports from 'Ali (&).66 1 have compiled them in my book:
Tayseer al-Kareem al-Mannrin fi Seerat Ameer al-Mu'mineen
'Uthmcin ibn 'Affin (The Biography of 'Uthmk ibn ' ~ f f h ) . ' ~

2. The words attributed to Qays ihn Sa'd, "We have sworn
allegiance to the best one we know after our Prophet (&)" are to
be rejected, because what is proven is to give precedence to Ahn
Bakr and 'Umar (&) over 'Ali (&), as stated in sound reports.
This is something that no one doubted at that time among the
Companions and others. Based on that, rhis cannot be soundly
athibuted to Qays ibn Sa'd (&) or to anyone else among the
Companions and T2bi'oon. This idea was unknown except
among the later R2fidi ~hia." Ibn Taymiyah said: "The earlier
Shia were all agreed on the superiority of Ahu Bakr and
mar."^^ There is a great deal of evidence for the superiority of
Abu Bakr and 'Umar, including the report narrated by Ibn 'Umar
(&): "We used to compare the people at the time of the Prophet
(&), and we would say that the best were Abu Bakr, then 'Umar
ibn a l - K h a ~ b then
,
'Uthmh ihn ' A G ~ . " ~ ~
The hadiths that speak of this are many and well-kn~wn.~'In
fact, as we have seen from the sound reports quoted above,
Mu'2wiyah asked Amir al-Mu'mineen to hand over the killers of
'Uthmh to him, and he never accused 'Ali of being involved in
the murder.

3.

The alleged letter from Mu'2wiyah to Qays ibn Sa'd and his
suggestion that 'Ali had played a part in the murder of 'Uthmk.
This could not have come from MuS2wiyahbecause it is quite
clear that 'Ali (&) was innocent, as we have seen previously.
This is something of which Mn'2wiyah (
$5) was not unaware,
and he would not have accepted it from Qays ibn Sa'd ($>I.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

561

Muhammad ibn Sireen, one of the senior Tibi'oon who lived at
that time, said: "Uthmk was killed, and I do not know of anyone
who accused 'Ali of killing him."" He also said: "When
'Uthmin was killed, his house was filled with people (who
wanted to protect him), among whom were Abdullah ibn 'Umar
and al-Hasan ibn 'Ali with his sword around his neck. But
'Uthmin insisted that they should not fight."73 Ibn Abi Shaybah
narrated, with a chain of narration whose men are sound, from
Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah that 'Ali (&) said: "May Allah
curse the killers of 'Uthmin on the plains and in the mountains,
on land and on sea."74 There are many texts that speak of this
matter,75 which confirms that 'Ali's hatred of the killers of
'Uthm2n was well known.76
4.

With regard to what was narrated about Mu'zwiyah accusing the
Ansir of shedding 'Uthmin's blood, this cannot be a valid report
from MuC2wiyahbecause he knew that those who defended
'Uthmin were all An$%. Ibn Sa'd narrated, with a sound chain
of narration, that Zayd ibn Thibit (&) came to 'UthmZn (&)
when he was under siege and said: "The An$% are at the door
and are saying that if you wish, we will be supporters of Allah
(An$& Allah) for a second time." 'UthmZn said: "As for
fighting, no."77

5. What was mentioned about Mu'iwiyah fabricating a letter in the
name of Qays ibn Sa'd. This is a lie. It could not possibly have
come from Mu'iwiyah because the Arabs used to regard lying as
one of the worst of attributes, something that noble men would
refrain from. We see this in the story of Abu Sufyin when he
was still a polytheist; Bukhari narrated that when Heraclius
asked him about the Messenger of Allah (g),
Abu S u f y k said:
"By Allah, were it not that I would feel too embarrassed that they
should narrate that I told a lie, I would have
This is how

562

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

lying was regarded by the Arabs; among the Muslims, it was
seen as even worse. Though one can argue that this was deceit
and war is deceit, deceit does not mean lying, as is well known.
Mu'iwiyah (&) was too smart to do that.79
6. The narration of these many letters among Qays, Mud2wiyahand
'Ali, in this particular sequence and with such precision, makes
the reader doubt because it is not known who knew about the
contents of these letters and who transmitted them.80

Dr. Yahya al-Yahya said: "The fact that Qays ibn Sa'd ibn
'Ubidah (&) was appointed as governor of Egypt by Amir alMu'mineen 'Aliibn Abi T&b (&) is something upon which there is
con~ensus."~'No biography of Qays failed to mention these
details.82In other words, what Abu Makhnaf mentioned in this report
was not even mentioned by the respectable historians of ~ g y ~ t , ' ~
although the report of Abu Makhnaf was narrated from at-Tabari in
snmmarised form by Ibn al-Atheer, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Khaldoon and
Ibn ~ a ~ h a r r i b a r dAl-Kindi
i . ~ ~ also nanated that 'Abdul-Kareem ibn
al-H%rith said: "When Mu'iwiyah got womed about Qays being in
Egypt, he wrote to some of Banu Umayyah in Madinah saying: 'May
Allah reward Qays ibn Sa'd with good, but conceal'it, for 1am afraid
that 'Ali may dismiss him if he hears of the relationship between him
and us.' When 'Aliheard about that letter, the leaders of Iraq and
Madinah who were with him said: 'Qays has changed.' 'Ali said:
'Woe to you, he has not changed. Leave me alone.' They said: 'You
should dismiss him because he has changed,' and they kept on at him
until he wrote to Qays, saying: 'I want you to be near me, so appoint
someone to be in charge in your absence and come."'85 This ~epofl
was regarded as more correct by Dr. Yahya in his valuable book
Manuiycit Abi MakhnafJCi Tareekh at-Tabari, in which he said:

It explained 'Ali's hesitation to dismiss Qays until the people put

waste brilliant leadership at times of turmoil.86

Appointment of Mdpmmad ibn
Abi Bakr as governor of Egypt
As we have seen, some people interfered to cause trouble
between 'Ali (&) and Qays ibn Sa'd, hoping that he would remove
him. In the end, some of 'Ali's consultants insisted that he dismiss
Qays because they believed the rumours about him. 'Ali (&) wrote
to him and said: "I want you to be near me, so appoint someone to be
in charge in your absence and come."87 This letter effectively
dismissed Qays from his post as governor of Egypt, and 'Ali
appointed al-Ashtar an-N&haZi to replace him," according to most
reports. 'Ali (&) met with al-Ashtar before he travelled to Egypt
and told him about Egypt and its people. He said: "Egypt has no one
but you; go, may Allah have mercy on yon, and if I do not give you
instructions, it is because I trust your judgement. Seek the help of
Allah for whatever wonies you, and mix strictness with gentleness;
be gentle when that is more effective, and be strict when shicmess is
the only way."8y ~ 1 - ~ s h twent

instigation of ~ u ' 2 w i ~ a h ? 'but the accusations made against

sound report. Ihn ~ a t h e e r and
~ ' Ibn ~ h a l d o o n ~both
' thought it very
unlikely, and Dr. Yahya al-Yaya agreed with them.93 I am also
inclined to favour this view.
Al-Ashtar died before he could start his work in Egypt;
nevertheless the sources speak of him as one of 'Ali's governors in
Egypt. After he died, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was appointed as
governor of ~ g y ~Het had
. ~previously
~
lived in Egypt at the time of
'Uthmgn (&), and the reports indicate that Muhammad ibn Ahi
Bakr reached Egypt before the previous governor, Qays ibn Sa'd,
left. A discussion took place between Qays ibn Sa'd and Muhammad
ibn Abi Bakr, in which Qays offered some advice to Muhammad,
especially with regard to the people who were angry about the
murder of 'Uthm2u (&) and who had not sworn allegiance to 'Ali
(&) after he died. Qays said: "0 Ahu al-QLim, you have come
from Amir al-Mu'miueen, and his dismissal of me should not prevent
me from giving sincere advice to you and to him, as I have good
experience about this matter (Egypt and its people). Leave these
people and those who joined them alone - meaning those who had
not sworn allegiance to 'Ali(&) or to anyone else. Leave them as
they are, then if they come to you, accept them, and if they stay away
from you, do not pursue them. Treat people according to their status,
and if you can visit the sick and attend funerals, then do so, for that
will not undermine your position."95
Muhammad brought with him a message from 'Ali (A).
He
read it to the people of Egypt and addressed them?' Akii alMu'mineen 'Ali wrote a letter to Muhammad ibn Ahi Bakr, which
came to him when he was appointed govemor of Egypt. It was not
limited to matters of governorship; it also called Muhammad ibn Abi
Bakr as-Siddeeq to Allah (%). Among other things, this letter said:
"Remember, 0 Muhammad, that even if you are in need of your
share of this world, you are in greater need of your share of the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

565

hereafter. If you have two matters to deal with, one which has to do
with the hereafter and the other which has to do with this world, then
start with that which has to do with the hereafter. Your desire to do
good should be great, and you should always base it on the right
intention, for Allah gives to a person according to his intention. If he
loves good deeds and the people who do them, but he does not do
them, he will inshallah be like one who has done them, because when
the Messenger of Allah (8
came
) hack from Tabook, he said: 'In
Madinah, there are men and you have not covered any distance or
crossed any valley but they were with you, but they were held back
by sickness.' They had the intentioa9' Moreover, remember 0
Muhammad [ibn Abi Bakr] that I have appointed you in charge of my
greatest troops, the people of Egypt, and I have put you in charge of
the people's affairs. You are right to fear for yourself concerning this
responsibility and to worry about your religious commitment, every
minute of the day. If you can, strive hard not to anger your Lord in
order to please His creation. Be harsh with the wrongdoer, and be
gentle with the righteous; bring the righteous close to you and make
them your inner circle and brothers. ~ a s - s a l & n . " ~ ~
After Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr started his governorship, the
first month passed peacefully, but things began to change after that.
Muhammad did not follow the advice of Qays ibn Sa'd, and he began
to bother those people who had not sworn allegiance to 'Ali (&). He
wrote to them and called them to swear allegiance, but they did not
respond. He sent men who destroyed their houses, confiscated their
wealth and imprisoned some of their children, so the people started to
fight him.99Then Mu'gwiyah prepared an army led by 'Amr ibn al'As, and he attacked Egypt and formed an alliance with those whom
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was fighting. The number of fighters
reached ten thousand, among whom were Maslamah ihn Mukhallad
and Mu'iwiyah ibn ~ u d a ~ jFierce
. ' ~ ~battles took place between
them and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. In the end, he was killed, and

566

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

Mu'iwiyah's troops took over in Egypt. Thus Egypt was lost by 'Ali
ibn Abi Tilib (&) in 38 AH."' Abu Makhnaf, the R Z d i Sbia, is the
only one who narrated a detailed report about this. It distorted a lot of
the historical facts, but it was quoted by ay-~abari'~'and a number of
historians, as follows:
Al-Ya'qoobi mentioned that 'Amr ibn al-'.& fought
M+ammad ibn Abi Bakr, and that Mu'iwiyah ibn Hudayj
caught him and killed him, then be put him inside the carcass of a
donkey and burned him.lo3 ~ l - ~ a s ' o o d iand
' ~ ~Ibn ~ i b b i ? m ' ~ ~
referred to the slaying of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, but they did not
mention any details.'06 Ibn a l - ~ t h e e r " ~narrated the report of Abu
Makhnafthat was quoted by at-Tabari, after omitting from it the letter
of Mu'iwiyah to Muhammad ibn Ahi Bakr and the text of the
correspondence between 'Ali (&) and Ibn Abi Bakr. He also
omitted the response of Ibn Abi Bakr to Mut5wiyah and 'Amr ibn al'AS, which was mentioned in the report of Abu Makhnaf that was
quoted by at-Tabari.
An-Nuwayri mentioned something similar to that wblch was
mentioned by Ibn a l - ~ t h e e r , " and
~ ibn Katheer included something
like what was mentioned by these two. Ibn Khaldoon referred to the
reports of Abu ~ a k h n a f , " ~and ibn Tagharribardi summarised
them."' All of these reports came via Abu Makhnaf and played a
role in distorting the Islamic history of that era. They were then
quoted by contemporary writers, who failed to examine them and
contributed to circulating them. Thus many of these lies became
entrenched in the minds of some educated people and became an
essential part of a series of misconceptions that spread among the
people.
Nevertheless, the fact that Mu'iwiyah ibn Hudayj killed
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr is proven through a sound report which
was narrated by Abu 'Awwinah from 'Abdur-Ramin ibn

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

567

ShamSlsah, who said: "I entered upon 'A'ishah, the Mother of the
Believers, and she said to me: 'Where are you from?' I said: 'I am
from Egypt.' She said: 'How did you find Ibn Hudayj in this
campaign of yours?' I said: 'We found him to he the best
commander. No slave of any of us died but he gave him another
slave, and no camel died except he gave him another camel, and no
horse died except he gave him another horse.' She said: 'The fact that
he killed my brother should not prevent me from narrating what I
heard from the Messenger of Allah (g):
"0 Allah, whoever attains
any position of authority among my Ummah and is harsh towards
them, be harsh towards h i , whoever attains any position of
authority among my Ummah and shows kindness towards them,
show kindness towards him; and whoever shows harshness towards
them, show harshness towards him." '

""'

The reports of Abu Makhuaf in Tareekh at-Tabari about
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr's governorship of Egypt and his slaying
include a number of strange things, the most prominent of which are
the following:

1. What he mentioned about the people of Syria swearing
allegiance to Mu'Slwiyah as caliph after the arbitration is not
correct. Ibn ' A s W narrated, with a chain of narration whose
men are trustworthy, that Sa'eed ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez atTanookhi, the most knowledgeable of the people regarding
~yria,"' said: "Ali was in Iraq and was called Amir alMu'mineen, while Mu'iwiyah was in Syria and was called the
amir. When 'Ali died, Mu'iwiyah in Syria was called Amir alMu'n~ineen.""~ This text explains that allegiance was not
sworn to MuCSlwiyahas caliph until after the death of 'Ali. This
is also the view of at-Tahari, who said concerning the last events
of 40 AH: In this year, allegiance was sworn to Mu'Slwiyah as
caliph in Aelia.l14 Ibn Katheer commented on this by saying:

568

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

"Meaning that when 'Ali died, the people of Syria swore
allegiance to Mu'iiwiyah as caliph, because there was no longer
anyone who could dispute with him."115 The people of Syria
knew that Mu'iiwiyah was not as qualified for the caliphate as
'Ali (&+) and that it was not permissible for him to become a
caliph when it was still possible for 'Ali (&) to be caliph. 'Ali's
superiority, seniority, knowledge, religious commitment,
courage and all his virtues were obvious and well known,
like the virtues of his brethren Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmiin and
others (may Allah he pleased with them all)."6 In addition to
that, there are texts which forbid giving allegiance to another
caliph when the first one is still in place. Muslim narrated in his
Saheeh that Ahu Sa'eed al-Khudri said: "The Messenger of
AUah (g)
said: 'If allegiance has been sworn to two caliphs,
then kill the second one."'"' There are many other similar texts,
so it is impossible that the Companions would have done
anything contrary to that.Iis
2.

He said: 'Amr ihn al-'AS made an agreement with Mu'iiwiyah to
the effect that Egypt would he his so long as he lived. This story
was narrated by Ibn 'As&ir with a chain of narration that
contains an unknown narrator."' It was also mentioned by adhDhahabi in such a way that implied that it was weak, hence it is
worthless and should he ignored.

3.

The accusation that Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr killed 'Uthm2n
(&) with his arrow is false. There are weak reports concerning
that. Moreover, the text is odd because it is contrary to the sound
report which states that the killer was an Egyptian man.'20 Dr.
Y&ya al-Y&ya stated a number of reasons to support the
innocence of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the murder of
'Uthm2n (&), including the following:
a. 'A'ishah (I&)
went out to Basra to pursue the killers of
..

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

569

(4).

'UthmZn
If her brother had been one of them, she
would not have mourned for him when he was killed.
h. 'ALi (&) cursed the killers of 'Uthmin (&) and
disavowed them, which implies that he would not bring
them close to him or appoint them to positions of
authority. He would not have appointed Muhammad ihn
Abi Bakr as governor of Egypt if he had been one of the
murderers.
c. Ibn 'As%ir narrated with his chain of narration that
Muhammad ihn Tabah ibn Musarraf said: "I heard
Kinkah, the freed slave of Saiiyyah hint Huyayy, say: 'I
was present when 'Uthmh was killed, and I was fourteen
years old.' He said: 'Was Mulpmmad ibn Ahi Bakr
directly involved in his killing?' He said: 'Allah forbid. He
entered upon him, and 'Uthmiin (&) said: "0 son of my
brother, yon are not the one who would kill me." So he
went out, and he did not play any role in the actual
killing."''z' This is also borne out by the report narrated
by Khaleefah ihn KhayyZC and at-Tahari, with a chain of
narration whose men are trustworthy, from al-Hasan alBasri, who was one of those present on the day 'Uthmh
(&)was killed,'" according to which Ibn Ahi Bakr took
hold of 'Uthmk's beard and 'Uthmk (&)
. . said to him:
"Yon are holding me in a way that your father would never
have done." So he went out and left him.123Thus it is clear
that M&ammad ihn Abi Bakr as-Siddeeq is innocent of
shedding 'Uthmh's blood just as the wolf was innocent of
shedding the blood of the prophet Yoosuf. It is also clear
that the reason why he was accused was that he entered the
house before the killing took place.124Ibn Katheer (may
Allah have mercy on him) said that when 'Uthmh (&)

spoke to him, he felt ashamed and he turned back and felt
regret. He covered his face and tried to defend him, hut his
efforts did not
d. The reports about Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Snfyin (&)
threatening Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr with mutilation, and
what was mentioned about putting the body of
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the carcass of a donkey
and burning it, are all contrary to Islamic rulings
concerning the handling of the dead. It is narrated that it is
forbidden to mutilate the bodies of disbelievers, so how
about the bodies of Muslims? Muslim narrated in his
Saheeh that when the Messenger of Allah (g)
appointed
commanders for an army or expedition, he would advise
them personally to fear Allah (&) and to be good to those
Muslims who were under their command. Then he would
say: "Fight in the name of Allah
for the sake of Allah.
Fight those who disbelieve in AUah (B).
Fight, but do not
steal from the war booty, do not break your promises, do
not mutilate (the enemy dead) and do not kill children."126

(s)

Ash-Shifa'i said: "When the Muslims captured some
polytheists and wanted to kill them, they killed them by beheading,
but they did not go beyond that. They did not mutilate them by
cutting off hands or feet or any part of the body, or stabbing them in
the stomach or burning or drowning or anything beyond what was
described, because the Messenger of Allah (@) forbade
mutilation." lz7
Can it be thought that the noble Companions would go against
this ruling when they were, as Ibn Mas'ood described them, "the best
of this Ummah, the most righteous in heart, the deepest in
knowledge, the most straightforward, people whom AUah chose to
accompany His Prophet (g)
and convey His religion, so follow their

example and their ways, for they are the Companions of Muhammad,
they were following true guidance, by the Lord of the ~ a ' b a b " ? ' ~ ~

(s)

Ibn Abi H2tim said concerning them: Allah
enjoins us to
adhere to their guidance and follow their way and example, as He
says: 4And [whoever] follows other than the believers' way, We shall
keep him in the path he has chosen, and bum him in hell - what an
evil destination!) (Qur'an 4: 115)
The soundest report about burning him was what was narrated
by at- Tabarini from al-Hasan al-Basri, who said: "He captured this
evildoer, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, in one of the mountain passes of
Egypt and put him inside the carcass of a donkey and burned
him," I29 But this report is mursal because al-Hasan al-Basri was not
present at that event and did not name for us the one from whom he
transmitted it, in addition to the fact that the text does not state who
did the burning. Moreover, al-Hasan would not have called him an
evildoer when he knew that 'Ali (&) praised him and gave him
precedence over others.130

(4)

e. What was mentioned about 'Ali
saying, "the evildoer
son of the evildoer," meaning Mu'iiwiyah ibn Abu
Sufyk. It is unlikely that 'Ali (&) would utter such
words since his dispute was with-Mu'iiwiyah, not his
father. Abu S u f y h (&) bad entered Islam and become a
good Muslim, and he died before the murder of 'Uthmin
(&), so he did not live to witness the tur~noil.'~'AUah
(%) says: BAnd no bearer of burdens shall bear another's
burden) (Qur'an 35: 18). The Companions were the most
knowledgeable of people about the Book of Allah and the
most committed to adhering to its limits, so bow can such
words be attributed to them?'32
f. What was mentioned about Mn'iwiyah ibn Hudayj (&),
when he was asked by 'Amr ibn al-'AS (&) to capture Ibn

572

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

Abi Bakr, reciting the verse, (Are your disbelievers [O
Quraysh!] better than these [nations of Nooh (Noah), Loot
(Lot), Silih, and the people of Fir'awn (Pharaoh), who
were destroyed)]? Or have you an immunity [against Our
Torment] in the Divine Scriptures?b (Qur'an 54: 43) This
implies that he was accusing Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
and others of being disbelievers. Such a thing is unknown
among the Companions (may AUah be pleased with them);
whatever happened among them, it did not reach the level
of denouncing one another as disbelievers. Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqqis (&) explained that when he said: "Whatever
happened among us was not of a religious nature."133
Moreover, Mn'iwiyah ibn Hudayj was one of the troops of
'Amr ibn al-'As, (&) and he would not have refused the
request of his commander.'34
g. What was narrated about Muhammad ibn Abi Bala saying
that 'Uthmin (&) was unjust and did not rule according
to Qur'an. I could not find any origin for this statement to
prove that it could be soundly attributed to Ibn Abi Bakr.
As for Ibn Abi Bakr's stating that 'Uthm2n (&) was
innocent of all false accusations, this is too well-known to
be denied.135 I have discussed it in detail in my book
Tayseer al-Kareem al-Manncin +
j ? Seerat 'Uthmcin ibn
'Affin (The Biography of 'Uthmin ibn 'Affin).

1.8. Basra
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) sent 'Uthmin ihn
to govern Basra in place of its former governor
Haneef
Abdullah ibn 'h,
who had left and gone to Makkah. 'Uthmin ibn
Haneef al-An&i had experience of the region, because he had
previously been appointed by 'Umar (&) to survey the Iraqi

j

'Ali ibn Abi Trjlib

573

lowlands for tax purposes and to estimate the land tax for it.'36
'Uthmk ibn Haneef went to Basra and entered it peacefully, but the
people of Basra divided into three groups. One group swore
allegiance to 'Ali and joined the main body of the Muslims. A second
group took a neutral stance and said, "We will wait and see what the
people of Madinah do, then we will do that." The third group refused
to swear allegiance to ' ~ l i . ' ~ ~
'Uthmh ibn Haneef did not remain governor for long. The
army of Talhab, az-Zubayr and 'kishah came to Basra before the
Battle of the Camel, accompanied by those who were seeking
revenge for the murder of 'Uthmin. Matters escalated, and fighting
took place, so 'Uthmh ibn Haneef went out to join Ali ibn Abi T%b
(&), meeting him on his way to Basra just before the Battle of the
Camel. Thus the governorship of 'Uthmh ibn Haneef ended.
'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) came to Basra and remained there for
some time, during which the Battle of the Camel took place; we will
discuss that in detail below inshallah. When 'Ali (&) wanted to
leave Basra, he appointed Abdullah ibn 'Abbas (&) as its governor
and put Ziyiid ibn Abeehi in charge of the land tax. He instmcted Ibn
'Abbiis to consult Ziyiid and follow his opinion, as 'Ali (&) realised
that he had work experience and was smart and diplomatic in dealing
with people.'38 'Ali also offered some advice to Ibn 'Abb;s,
including the following: "I advise you to fear AUah (%) and be just
towards those whom Allah has put you in charge of. Be generous
towards people by being cheerful and sharing knowledge and
wisdom with them, and beware of bearing grudges, for they deaden
the heart and kill the trnth. Remember that whatever brings you
closer to Allah takes you further away from the fire, and whatever
brings you closer to the fire takes yon further away from Allah (&).
Remember AUah a great deal, and do not be among the heedless." 139

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

Abdullah Ibn 'Abbis began to do his job, and he was a
Companion who was well-known for his vast knowledge of Islamic
law and interpretation of the Qur'an. He proved to have
administrative skills when he managed to spread security in Sijistan,
which had belonged to the province of Basra, and in the region of
Persia where he appointed Ziyid ibn Abi Snfyib as its governor. He
also left him in charge when he was away from Basra. He managed to
establish security there. Ibn 'Ahbis is regarded as one of the most
important helpers of Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
he used to
accompany him during serious developments and he would advise
him and speak on his behalf, and Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
relied on him and consulted him. Ibn 'Abbik's governorship of Basra
lasted until 39 AH, and the men in charge of the police force and the
land tax cooperated with him. According to some reports, Ibn 'Abbh
remained in Basra until the murder of 'Ali
At-Tabari said,
concerning the events of 40 AH: "At that time, Abdullah ibn 'Abbis
left Basra and went to Makkah, according to most of the biographers.
But some of them denied that and claimed that he was still in Basra,
running it on behalf of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) until he was
killed, and after the murder of 'Ali, al-Hasan made a peace deal with
Mu'iwiyah, then he left and went to ~ a k k a h . " ' ~ ~

(4);

(a).

The character of Ibn 'Abbis was that of a dedicated leader who
combined qualities such as knowledge, alertness, intelligence,
patience, resolve and others. He was also well known for his deep
understanding and knowledge, because of the prayer of the
Messenger of Allah (g),
who asked that he be given understanding
of religion and knowledge of interpretation. In addition to that, he
learned from the senior Companions (may AUah be pleased with
them), so he was very capable in ijtihid and deriving rulings. He had
a deep interest in the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an and
had a distinct method of teaching his companions. He was very keen

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

575

to spread knowledge. He travelled a great deal, and he died at a
relatively late stage.
he attracted special
He was also very close to 'Umar (&);I4'
attention from 'Umar (&), who saw in him signs of smartness,
intelligence and alertness. He used to bring him close to him in his
gatherings, and he would consult him and ask his opinion about
verses he was not sure about, even when Ibn 'Abbb was still a young
man. This had a great impact on him and motivated and encouraged
him to acquire knowledge, progress fnrther and achieve more in
commentary on the Qur'an and in other fields. It was narrated from
'Amir ash-Sha'bi that Ibn 'Abb& (&) said: "My father said to me:
'0 my son, I see that Amir al-Mu'mineen ('Umar) brings you close
and discusses some matter with you only and also consults you along
with other Companions of the Messenger of Allah. So learn three
things from me: fear Allah and do not disclose his secrets, never tell
lies to him and do not backbite about anyone in his presence."'14z
'Umar (&) used to include him with the senior Companions, and
that was because be saw in him deep knowledge, clear thinking and
subtle understanding in deriving rulings. Ibn 'Abbh (&) said:
"Umar used to ask me along with the Companions of Muhammad
(g).
He used to say to me: 'Do not speak until they have spoken,'
then when I spoke, be would say to them: 'You have disappointed me
by not being able to come up with what this boy, who is still not yet
mature, has come up with. ,,,I43 Ibn 'Ahb& was very polite, so when
he sat in a gathering in which there were people older than him, he
would not speak unless permission was given to him. 'Umar (&)
saw that in him, so he urged him to speak, in order to give him
confidence and encourage him to seek k n 0 w 1 e d ~ e . l ~ ~
'Umar (&) had a gathering in which he would listen to young
people and teach them. Ibn 'Abbh was one of 'Umar's favonrites. It
was narrated that 'Abdur-Ribn Zayd said: "When 'Umar ibn

576

Governors at the time of 'Aliibn Abi Tilib

d-KhatJib (&) prayed and had finished offering a voluntary prayer,
he would go into a place where dates were stored, then he would call
for the young men who had learned Qur'an, among whom was Ibn
'Abbb. They would come and read Qnr'an and discuss its meanings,
and when the time came for the afternoon rest, they would leave.
They came to this verse: (And when it is said to him, "Fear Allah",
he is led by arrogance to [more] crime. So enough for him is bell, and
worst indeed is that place to rest! And of mankind is he who would
sell himself, seeking 'the Pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of
kindness to [His] slaves) (Qur'an 2: 206-207). Ibn 'Abbk said to
those who were next to him: 'The two men are going to fight.' 'Umar
heard him and said: 'What did you say?' He said: 'Nothing, 0 Amir
al-Mu'mineen.' He said: 'What did you say? The two men are going
to fight?' When Ibn 'Abb2s saw that, he said: 'I see in this verse the
one who, if he is told to fear Allah, be is led by arrogance to (more)
crime, and I see the one who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure
of Allah. So he tells the first one to fear Allah, and if he does not
accept it and is led by arrogance to (more) crime, he says: I will sell
myself. So the two men fight.' 'Umar
said: 'By Allah, what a
brilliant man you are, 0 Ibn ' ~ b b i s ! " " ~ ~

(4)

'Umar (&) would ask Ibn 'Abb% about things in the Qur'an,
then he would say: "Dive deep [in knowledge], 0 diver!"146 If
difficult cases were brought to him, he would say to Ibn 'Abbh: "0
Ibn 'Abbis, there has come to us a difficult case, and you are up to it
and similar cases." Then he would follow his opinion, and be would
not call anyone else for that purpose if he was faced with a difficult
case.'47 It was narrated that Sa'd ibn Abi W a q q i ~said: "I never saw
anyone more quick-witted, more wise, more knowledgeable and
more forbearing than Ibn 'Abb2s. I saw 'Umar ibn d-Khatrib call
him when there was a difficult case, then he would say: 'Here you
are, here is a difficult case.' Then he would not follow any view other

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

577

than his, even though he had around him people of the Muhgjueen
and An& who had been present at ~ a d r . " ' ~ ~
'Umar described him as "the young man of the middle aged;
he has an ever-asking tongue and a smart mind."149 Tabah ibn
'Ubaydullah said: "I never saw 'Umar ibn al-KhagZb (&) give
precedence to anyone over Ibn ' A b b g ~ . " 'Ibn
~ ~ 'Ahhiis (&) stayed
very close to 'Umar (&), as he was keen to ask him questions and
learn from him. Hence he (&) was one of the Companions who
transmitted the most of the Qur'anic commentary and knowledge of
'Umar (&). Some scholars have suggested that most of the
knowledge of f i n 'Abbk was acquired from 'Umar (may Allah be
pleased with them al1).lS1 'Umar's care for him helped him to
advance far ahead in knowledge in general and in interpreting the
Qur'an in particular.152Hence the Makkan school during the era of
the Tibi'oon was honoured by the presence of the scholar of the
Ummah and the interpreter of the Qur'an, Ibn 'Abbgs
At the time of 'Uthm2n (&), Ibn 'AbhL was one of those
who were close to the caliph, and 'Uthmh (&) appointed him to
lead the people on hajj in the year in which he was killed.lS4
Nevertheless, some of those who have been influenced by the
Orientalist school of thought have hied to distort the image of this
scholar of the Ummah by disseminating lies and fabrications about
his life. We should remember that when it comes to the era of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs and the history of the early Islamic period,
the Orientalist school of thought is an extension of the work of the
RZfidi historians and extreme Shia, who fabricated reports and
distorted the biographies of the noble Companions (may AUah be
pleased with them). The Orientalist historians revived these false and
fabricated reports, moulding and shaping them in a modem style
under the slogans of objectivity and academic research. They are all
lies and falsehood, but many researchers, writers and historians have

1

578

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

been influenced by them. Hence you find in contemporary books of
history and literature, which are far removed from the methodology
of Ah1 as-Sunnah and based heavily on Orientalist methodology and
style, very weird distortions of the lives of the Companions. One
example is the claim made in these books that Abdullah ibn 'Abbb
(&) stole the wealth of the Muslims in Basra, betrayed his cousin
'Ali (&) and fled with the stolen wealth to Makkah, and that he
started planning to join ~ u ' i i w i ~ a hafter
' ~ ~having supported 'Ali.
That was mentioned shamelessly by Dr. Taha Hussein in his hook alFitnah al-Kubra: 'Ali w a Banuhu. I will quote some of what he said:

1. "Ibn 'Abbh had knowledge of religious and worldly matters,
and he had status among Banu Hiishim in particular and among
Quraysh in general, and in the hearts of all Muslims, that could
be sufficient to protect him from drifting away from his
cousin."'56
2. "Ibn 'Abbk saw that his cousin's star was in decline and that
Mu'iiwiyah's star was in the ascendancy, so he stayed in Basra,
thinking of himself more than his cousin."'57
3. "Even though IIbn 'Abb2s forgot about himself (i.e., his position
and how he should behave) for a little while, he did not want to
put himself in a position where he should put himself, as 'Ali's
governor in one of the Muslim regions."158
There are also other lies and nonsense which the author took
from weak and fabricated reports. It is sufficient honour for Ibn
'Abbk that the Messenger of Allah (g)
prayed for him, saying: "0
Allah, teach him interpretation of the Qur'an and give him
understanding of religion."'59
Ibn 'Abb2s began his work as governor of Basra after 'Ali
(4)left Basra for Kufah, and he joined 'Ali (4)
just before the
Battle of Siffeen, having left Ziyiid ibn Abeehi in charge of Basra.160
During his governorship of Basra, Ibn 'Ahhis accomplished a

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

579

number of things, the most important of which was putting the affairs
of Sijistan in order after the murder of its governor at the hands of a
group of Kharijites. On 'Ali's instructions, Ibn 'Abbis sent a number
of troops from Basra who managed to kill the Kharijites there, put its
affairs in order and bring security to its people in 36 AH.16'
Ibn 'Abbis and the troops of Basra also played a role with 'Ali
ibn Abi T%b (&) in the battle of siffeen.16' Ibn 'Abbis played a
role in organising some of the regions belonging to his province and
appointing amirs there who were under
authority. He sent Ziyid
ibn Abeehi to Persia, where he managed to sort out the situation and
discipline the people after they had rebelled.'63 During his time, the
people of Astakhar broke their covenant, so he attacked them and
disciplined them.164In 38 AH, Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Sufy2n sent a
man to Basra to promote his cause among its people, but Ziygd ibn
Abeehi, who was Ibn 'Abbh's deputy in Basra, succeeded in
resisting him until he killed the man in one of the houses of ~ a s r a . " ~
Ibn 'Abbh (4)
accompanied 'Ali (&) on many of his
ventures in Iraq. If something happened while Ihn 'Abbb was in
Basra, he would keep 'Ali (&) informed by means of letters that he
sent to him continually; he also wrote letters to ask his opinion about
many issues and matters of governorship. In 38 AH, 'Ali (&) sent
Ibn 'Abbk as his deputy in charge of the hajj. According to atTabari, Ihn 'Abbis (&) remained as governor of Basra until 'Ali
(&) was martyred. The governor of Basra had a number of helpers
at the time of 'Ali (&),
. . including the judge, the chief of police, the
official in charge of the land tax and others. The province of Basra
also included some areas of Persia.
From the information cited above, it is clear that after
allegiance was sworn to him, 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) hastened to
dismiss Ihn 'Amir, who was 'Uthmiin's governor in Basra, and he
appointed instead 'Uthmin ibn Haneef. Then the Battle of the Camel

580

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

led to instability, and 'Uthmin ibn Haneef lost control of Basra and
was forced to leave until 'Ali (&)
. . got there. After the Battle of the
Camel, 'Ali (&) strove to put the province's affairs in order.166
Some turmoil also occurred in Basra later as a result of the Kharijite
movement and Mu'iwiyab's attempt to gain control of the region.
Despite that, Basra remained one of the Islamic provinces that
belonged to the caliphate throughout 'Ali's era, and his opponents
did not manage to gain control of it.167
In Basra, the leadership abilities of Ibn 'Abbis came to the
fore. He benefited from having kept company with 'Ali (may Allah
be pleased with them both), and he was deeply influenced by him.
Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&) gave him advice and guidance, and he
exhorted him from time to-time. Ibn 'Abbis said: I never benefited
from the words of anyone after the Messenger of Allah (s)as I
benefited from a letter written to me by 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib
in
which he said: "A man would feel upset to miss out on what he could
never have gotten, and he could be pleased to get what he never could
have missed, so let your pleasure be in that which you get of matters
pertaining to the hereafter, and let your regret be with regard to what
you miss of that. Whatever you get of worldly gains, do not be too
happy about it, and whatever you miss out on of worldly matters, do
not be too upset about it; let your concern be what happens after
death."

(A),

Ibn 'Abbis was one of those who prayed q i y h regularly. It
was narrated that Ibn Maleekah said: "I accompanied Ihn 'Abbh
from Makkah to Madinah. He used to pray two by two, and he would
spend half the night in prayer, reciting Qur'an slowly, letter by letter,
and weeping and sobbing a great deal."169 He (&) wept so much
that traces of that were left on his cheeks. It was narrated that Ahu
Raja' said: "I saw ibn 'Abbis, and the bottom of his eyes was like a
worn out shoelace because of weeping."170 He also used to fast on

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

581

Mondays and Thursdays. It was narrated that Sa'eed ibn Abi Sa'eed
said: "I was with Ibn 'Abbk, and a man came and said: '0 Ibn
'Abbis, how do you fast?' He said: 'I fast Mondays and Thursdays.'
He said: &Why?'He said: 'Because deeds are taken up at that time,
and I like my deeds to be taken up when I am fasting.""7'
He was also very generous and acknowledged the position and
status of the senior Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).
Once Abu Ayyoob al-An$%-i (&) was going through some financial
difficulties and was burdened with debts. He came to stay with Ibn
'Abbb, who emptied his house for him and said: "I shall do for you
what you did for the Messenger of Allah (@J."'~~Then he said:
"How much is your debt?" Abn Ayyoob said: "Twenty thousand."
So Ibn 'Abbb gave him forty thousand, and twenty slaves, and
everything that was in the house.173
He was one of the most eloquent of people and had an amazing
ability to make listeners understand. It was narrated that al-A'mash
said: "Abu WPil told us: 'Ibn 'Abbb addressed us when he was the
leader of the hajj. He started to recite Soorat an-Noor, reciting and
explaining the meaning. I said: I have never seen or heard a man who
speaks like that. If the Persians, Romans and Turks heard him, they
would become M ~ s l i r n . " " ~He
~ was one of the most handsome,
most eloquent and most knowledgeable of people. It was narrated
that Masrooq said: "When I saw Ibn 'Abbss, I thought he was the
most handsome of people; when he spoke, I thought he was the most
eloquent of people; when he preached, I thought he was the greatest
of people."'75 AlLQ2sim ibn Muhammad said: "I never saw any talk
of falsehood in the gathering of Ibn ' ~ b b 6 . ' "When
~ ~ he (&) lost
his sight before his death, he said in verse concerning that:
I f Allah takes the light from my eyes,
still there is light from that light
on my tongue and in my heart...177

He was one of the most influential people of his age. In brief,
he was one of the best examples of the heirs of the Prophets.

1.9. Kufah
When 'Uthmk (&) was martyred, his governor in Kufah
was Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari (&). After allegiance was swam to 'Ali
(&) as caliph, 'Ali (&) confiied Abu Moosa in that position.
Abu Moosa accepted the people's oath of allegiance to 'Ali (&),
and he wrote to tell him about the attitude of the people of Kufah
concerning swearing allegiance to him; many of them agreed to it and
accepted it.17' When Amir al-Mu'mineen left Madinah to go to Iraq,
he started asking about Abu Moosa in particular. On the way to Iraq,
he was met by a man from Kufah. 'Ali (&) asked him about Abu
Moosa, and he answered: "If you want peace and reconciliation, then
Abn Moosa is the man who can help with that, but if you want to
fight, then Abu Moosa is not the man who can help with that." 'Ali
(&) said: "By N a b , I do not want anything but peace and
reconciliation, unless it is rejected (by the other party)." He said: "I
have told you what I know."179
Later on, it became clear that Abu Moosa was inclined towards
reconciliation and making peace, and he did not want there to be
fighting among the Muslims. 'Ali (&) sent Muhammad ibn Abi
Bakr, 'Ammk ibn Ygsir, al-Hasan ibn 'Ali and others in delegations
to urge the people of Kufah to mobilize before the Battle of the
Camel (which we will discuss in detail below inshallah). The people
of Kufah asked Abu Moosa about the situation and consulted him
about going out to fight. He said: 'What is in your best interests with
regard to the hereafter is to stay; as for what is in your worldly
interests, it is to go out on the campaign. But you know best about
your sit~ation.""~A number of the people of Kufah were convinced
to go out with al-Hasan (&),after numerous lengthy debates

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

583

between them and al-Hasan. It was said that nearly nine thousand
men went out with b h ~ . "number
~ ~ of reports suggest that the
governorship of Abu Moosa ended during this period, just before the
Battle of the Camel. Some reports state that al-Ashtar, "who was one
of 'Ali's commanders", had expelled Abu Moosa and his workers
from the palace of Kufah and had taken it over.18z There are also
reports that 'Ali (&) wrote to Abu Moosa, dismissing him and
appointing Qar&ib ihn Ka'b al-An& as governor of Kufah in his
place.183
After the Battle of the Camel, 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) came to
Kufah, and Kufah became the seat of the caliphate. He was directly in
charge of Kufah and the provinces that belonged to it, and it gained a
special position for the rest of his era. It was now the capital of the
caliphate, from which Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) ran the affairs
of the various parts of the state. It was the city to which the
delegations came and from which the troops set out. That was also a
means of attracting people to come and live in it. This undoubtedly
played a major role in reviving commercial and development activity
in Kufah throughout 'Ali's caliphate. He (&) paid a great deal of
attention to it and checked on its people himself. He was also keen to
appoint someone to act as his deputy in mnning its affairs whenever
he was absent. When 'Ali (&) wanted to set out for Siffeen, he
appointed Abu Mas'ood a l - ~ i d r in charge of ~ u f a h . " ~
When he
planned to go and fight the Kharijites in ~ a b r a w i h ' ~
he~appointed
,
Hihi' ibn Hawdhah an-~akha'i,"~who remained there until 'Ali
(&) was martyred. 187
We have seen that Kufah was run by governors until 'Ali (&)
took it as the seat of the caliphate. Then he became in charge of its
affairs, and he appointed people to manage its affairs when he was
absent. Kufah became a city of particular importance because Amir
al-Mu'mineen took up residence there.'"

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

1.10. Eastern provinces
1.10.1. Persia
The sources state that 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib appointed Sahl ibn
Haneef al-Ans2ri (&) as governor of Persia. He remained there until
37 AH, when the people of Persia rebelled and drove him out. 'Ali
(&) contacted Ibn 'Abbgs, who was in charge of Basra, and
discussed with him the situation in Persia. After consulting a number
of people, he agreed that Ibn 'Abbgs would send his helper, Z i y a ibn
Abi Sufygn, to handle the situation and take charge of
Here
we see the clear connection between the province of Basra and the
region of Persia, and how Ibn 'Abbis felt that he was responsible for
that region because he was directly in charge of Basra. Ziy2d headed
for Persia accompanied by fonr thousand troops. He subjugated that
land and put an end to the turmoil there, and he managed to put its
affairs in order.''' Ziygd was well known for his great political
ability, which helped him to restore stability to that land with a
minimum of losses.191
At-Tabari said: When Ziy2d came to Persia. he sent for it7
leaders. He promised rewards to those who would support him, and he
threatened others, warning them and creating divisions among them,
giving intelligence about one group to another. Some of them fled,
and some stayed and fought one another. Persia came fully under his
control, and he did not encounter any fighting or war. He did
something similar in ~ a r m i k .92
' Then he went to Persia and marched
through different cities, promising rewards. The people were happy
with that, aud the country submitted to him completely.'93 Ziygd put
the affairs of Persia in order, built some fortresses there, and orgauised
the land tax. He brought order to many places that were under his
governorship, until peace and security spread throughout the land.lg4
Ziygd continued as governor of Persia for the remainder of 'Ali's

'Ali ibn Abi To'lib

585

caliphate. He was the most famous of 'Ali's governors in Persia
because of his policies and his ability to control it.195
There were some administrative divisions within the region of
Persia, and mention is made of some govemors who were in charge
of certain cities within that region. In the case of Astakhar, it is stated
that one of its governors was al-Mundhir ibn a l - ~ a r o o d , and
' ~ ~ there
was some correspondence between 'Ali (&) and him.197 Ziygd ihn
Abi S u f y b also settled there and fortified himself after the murder of
'Ali
The sources also mention Isfahan, which is regarded as
one of Persia's largest cities.'99 One of 'Ali's governors in this city
was Muhammad ibn ~ u l a ~ One
m . of
~ ~the~ most famous of his
governors in Isfahan was 'Umar ibn Salamah, who brought wealth
and food from Isfahan to 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&).'O1 Coins were
minted in Persia in the year 39 AH, during the caliphate of 'Ali (&).
They bear Arabic phrases as weU as the date on which they were
minted,'''
and some of them are still preserved in the Iraqi Museum.

1.10.2. Khorasan
Khorasan was as a large province that was directly and
indirectly connected to the province of Basra at the time of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs. Dnring the caliphate of 'Ali (&), a number
of incidents took place in this province. Many of its governors and
some of the rulers of its cities are mentioned. It is narrated that the
first of 'Ali's governors in Khorasan was 'Abdur-R&mZn ihn
~bza.'O~Another of 'Ali's governors in Khorasan was Ja'dah ibn
Hnbayrah ibn Abi ~ a b b , ' " whom 'Ali (&) sent there after
returning from Siffeen in 37 AH. The people of Khorasan had
apostatised, and be tried to discipline them and bring order to the land
once again.'05 It seems that he did not succeed, so 'Ali
sent one
of his commanders to Khorasan; he managed to make a peace deal
with its people and bring its affairs under control once more.z0h

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

Sijistan was one of the regions bordering Khorasan; both
regions were to some extent connected to the governor of Basra, and
there was usually an administrative connection between the two
regions. The sources mentioned some of the governors of Sijistan at
the time of 'Aliibn Abi Taih (&), one of whom was 'AbdurR & m h ibn Juz' a t - ~ ~ i 'Ali
. ' ~(&)
~ sent him to Sijistan after the
Battle OF the Camel, but he was killed by some Arab thugs who
spread mischief in the land. Then 'Ali (&) wrote to Ibn 'Abbb in
Basra, instructing him to send another amir to Sijistan. Ibn 'Abbis
sent Rib'i ibn Ka's al-'Anbari, who managed to put an end to the
revolution of the thugs and kill their leader, thus restoring order to the
land. He stayed there until 'Ali ibn Abi Taib ( 4 )was martyred.'08
Hamadhh was one of the eastern border regions. During the
caliphate of 'Uthmh (&), it was distinguished by the presence of
an independent governor. At the time of 'UtkmWs death, its
governor was Jareer ibn Abdullah al-Bajali. After allegiance was
sworn to 'Ali (4)
as caliph and he reached Iraq, he sent word to
Jareer ibn Abdullah in Hamadhh, instructing him to receive the oath
of allegiance to 'Ali (&) as caliph from the people in this region and

in Knfah, and he sent him to Mu'gwiyah in Syria. Then
he went back and was exposed to some insults from some of the
troops of 'Ali (&), including al-Ashtar and others, so Jareer gave up
his governorship and went and joined Mu'2wiyah in Syria. That
happened just before the battle of ~iffeen.'~'

587

Tiilib (&) as caliph, he wrote to al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, asking him to
swear allegiance to him and to receive the oath of allegiance from the
people in his land.212It seems that 'Ali (&) asked d-Ash'ath ibn
Qays to come, and he joined 'Ali (&) in Kufah; then he was present
with him in all subsequent battles and took part with him in the battle
of 3ffeen2l3 and in fighting the Kharijites. It seems that 'Ali (&)
appointed Sa'eed ibn S z y a h al-Khuzi'i as governor of Azerbaijan
during this period, then he re-appointed al-Ash'ath ibn Qays later.
Al-Baladhuri stated that 'Ali (&) made it part of the province of

during his governorship of Azerbaijan, such as settling some
Arab groups in ~ r d a b i l ~
and
' ~ turning it into a Muslim city, then
building its mosque after Islam spread among its people.216

(4)

The names of some of 'Ali's governors in other eastern lands
are also mentioned. Al-Khirreet ibn Rhhid was 'Ali's governor in
some part of al-Ahwk before Siffeen. When 'Ali (&)returned from
Siffeen, al-Khirreet began to gather troops and called for the toppling
of 'Ali (*), and he captured some places. News of that reached 'Ali,
so he sent an army that managed to put an end to this movement and
kill al-Khirreet.217This will be discussed in detail below.
One of 'Ali's commanders in al-Ahwiz was Masqalah ibn
Hubayrah a s h - ~ h a ~ b 2 nHe

gathered some troops at the time of 'Ali(&) and headed towards
Sind after the people rallied around him, but he and the troops with
him lost one of their battles, and none of his army was left except for
a small
Another of 'Ali's governors was Yazeed ibn
Hajiyyah at-Tameemi, whom 'Ali (&) appointed as governor of arRayy after Siffeen. Later, 'Ali (&) accused him of stealing from the

land tax revenues, so he detained him in Kufah, but he subsequently
fled to Mu'zwiyah in ria.^^^
In al-Mad%in, the governor was Sa'd ibn Mas'ood athThaqafi, who played a principal role in confronting the Kharijites; a
number of letters were exchanged among him and 'Ali
and his
commanders when the Kharijites tried to reach a l - ~ a d 2 ' i n . " ~Sa'd is
regarded as one of the famous commanders of 'Ali (&). Perhaps the
proximity of his city to Kufah was the main reason for his joining
'Ali (4)
in many battles. It is well known that Sa'd appointed his
nephew al-Mukht2r ibn Abi 'Ubayd ath-'l"naqafiZz3in charge of alMad2in in his absence. 'Ali (&) got angry with al-Mukhtk athThaqafi as the result of his unlawful handling of the funds fiom land
taxes.224The historian Abu Haneefah ad-Deenoori mentioned more
names of 'Ali's governors in different regions.2z5

(4)

(4)

It is obvious that 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib
expended a great
deal of effort to organize the provinces, and that he suffered a great
deal of difficulty and many problems in his position as caliph. A
number of provinces were lost to him, such as Yemen, the Hijaz and
Egypt. He never even gained control of some other provinces, such
as Syria, Palestine and neighbouring regions. In the provinces that
did remain under his control, such as Iraq and Persia, he suffered
many problems, chief among which was the trouble with the
Kharijites who emerged in these regions, especially in the final years
of his rule. Hence stability in those regions was never complete
because the original inhabitants of eastern lands such as Persia,
Khorasan and Sijistan launched a number of rebellions, in which
some of 'Ali's governors were killed. Some of the most prominent
problems faced by 'Ali (&) were the disputes with some governors,
as a result of which they gave up their positions; these included Jareer
ibn Abdullah in Hamadhin, Mafdalah ibn Hubayrah in al-Ahwzz and
others. He was faced with a number of obstacles that took up all his

Xli ibn Abi TLilib

589

energy and efforts. Thus it is clear that 'Ali (4)
spent his entire
caliphate dealing with internal struggles, which in many cases
prevented him from putting the affairs of those lands in order as he
wanted to do. These problems preoccupied the historians, who
focused on them at the expense of discussing the administrative
affairs of these provinces.z26

2. Appointment of governors
at the time of 'Ali (&)

(a)

Allegiance was sworn to 'Ali
as caliph after the murder
of 'Uthmin (&).
There was turmoil in different regions of the state
, .,
as a result of 'Uthmin's murder; hence 'Ali (&) was given
allegiance in difficult circumstances, in which the Islamic state began
to lose a great deal of its stability and energy. This unrest emerged
clearly in Madinah itself, and things became chaotic in other regions
of the state, too. The sincere advisers and consultants sensed the
seriousness of what was taking place, so some of them offered
sincere advice to 'Ali from the outset, especially with regard to his
governors.227

2.1. Ali's attitude towards the governors of
'Uthmsn, and his appointment of his relatives
2.1.1. 'Ali's attitude towards the
governors of 'Uthmiin
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
.. understood fully that one of the
main causes of the turmoil was that some people were not pleased
with the governors of 'Uthmk (&). That was because of the
rumours spread by the leaders of the turmoil against 'Uthmsn (&)

590

Govemor.~at the time of 'Aliibn Abi Tcilib

and his governors, not because they were incapable or unjust. Many
contemporary writers, however, in their discussion of 'Ali's policies
in appointing governors, start by saying that 'Ali (&) would not
have agreed to leave 'UthmWs governors in their positions for one
minute after he was appointed caliph, and that what prevented him
from doing so was his religious commitment and sincerity.228How
terrible this accusation is against 'Uthmin (&) and his governors. I
have refuted it in my book Tayseer al-Kareem al-Manncinfi Seerat
'Uthmin ibn 'Affcin, where I devoted an entire section to discussing
the facts about the governors of 'Utbmin (&).229 Whoever wishes
to know more may refer to it.
Those who criticised 'U(bm$n's governors relied on reports
that are well-known to be worthless, such as:
(a) The report narrated via al-W2qidi that Ibn 'Abbh said: " U h 2 n
summoned me and appointed me in charge of the hajj, then I
came to Madinah after allegiance had been sworn to 'Ali. I went
to him in his house, and I found al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah
talking to him on his own, so he told me to wait until alMugheerah left. I said: 'What did he say?' He said: 'He told me
previously to send for AhduUah ibn 'Amir, Mu'2wiyah and the
governors of 'Uthmiin, to confirm their positions so that they
would get allegiance for him from the people, because they can
calm people down and maintain order. But I refused at that time
and said: "By Allah, if I had only a brief time to decide about
them, I would not have c o n f m e d their position, and people l i e
them are not to be appointed as governors." Then he departed,
and I knew that he thought 1was mistaken. Then he came hack to
me just now and said: "The first time, I gave you that advice and
you disagreed with me. Then I thought about it after that, and
now I believe that you should do what you think best. So dismiss
them, and appoint those whom you trust. Allah will suffice you,

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

591

and they are less powerfnl than they used to be." ' " Ibn 'Abbss
said: I said to 'Ali: "He gave you sincere advice the first time,
but this time he was insincere." 'Ali (&) said: "Why was he not
sincere?" Ibn 'Abbh said: "Because you know that Mu'iwiyah
and his companions are people of worldly ambitions. If you
confirm them in their positions, they would not care who
becomes caliph, hut if yon dismiss them, be will say that this
matter was decided without proper consultation and he is the one
who killed our caliph, and they will incite the people against
you. Thus the people of Syria and Iraq will all turn against you.
Moreover, I cannot be certain that T a w and az-Zubayr will not
turn against you." 'Ali said: "As for what you mentioned about
confirming them in their positions, by Allah I have no doubt that
that may serve some immediate worldly interest. But on the
basis of what I know about the governors of 'Uthmiin, by Allah I
should never appoint any one of them. If they comply, that is
good for them; if they refuse, then I have to give them the
sword." Ibn 'Abbas said: "Listen to me. Go into your house or
go and live in your land in Yanbu', and close your door. Then if
you see the Arabs going through some confusion and turmoil,
they will realise that they have no one else but you. But by Allah,
if you join this group today, the people will blame you for the
murder of 'Uthmin tomorrow." But 'Ali (&) refused and said
to Ibn 'Ahbis: "Go to Syria, for 1have appointed you as its
govemor." Ibn 'Abbb said: "That is not a good idea.
Mu'iwiyah is from Banu Umayyah; he is the paternal cousin of
'Uthmh (&), and he is his govemor in Syria. I cannot be
certain that he is not going to strike my neck in retaliation for
'Uthmk; the least he can do is detain me and have control over
me." 'Ali (&) said to him: "Why is that?" He said: "Because of
the blood ties between me and you; whatever he blames you for,
be will blame me for it too. Rather write to Mu'swiyah and make

592

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

him a promise." But 'Ali (&) refused and said: "By Allah, I
will never do that."230

(b) The second report is similar to the first report in meaning, but it
contains some additional details and differences that shed doubt
on its authenticity. This report says that Ibn 'Abbb came to
Makkah after the murder of 'Uthmh
On his way, he met
az-Zubayr and Talhah in a n - ~ a w i ~ i fon
, ~their
~ ' way to Makkah
with a group of Quraysh. But this is contrary to the truth,
because allegiance was sworn to 'Ali (&) after Ibn 'Abbb
returned from hajj, and az-Zubayr and Talhah swore allegiance
to 'Ali (&).
. ., If they had left at this time, it would have been
before allegiance was sworn to 'Ali (&). This is clearly and
seriously incorrect.232

(4).

(c) The report of Abu Makhnaf, which is narrated without any chain
of narration, according to which al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah
advised 'Ali (&) to confirm Mu'iwiyab's position as governor
of Syria and to appoint Talhah and az-Zubayr as governors of
Basra and Kufah. Ibn 'AbbL objected to his opinion because
Basra and Kufah represented sources of wealth, and if they were
in charge of them, they would put pressure on 'Ali (&), and
Mu'iwiyah's being governor of syria would not benefit him and
might harm him. 'Ali listened to what Ibn 'Abbb said, and he
did not accept the suggestion of al-Mngheerah ibn ~ h u ' b a h . ~ ~ ~
(d) The first report of al-Wgqidi in brief is narrated from Ibn 'Abdul~ a r r but
, ~it ~mentions
~
al-Hasan instead of Ibn ' ~ b b i s . ~ ~ ~
The gravity of these reports stems from the fact that they
formed the basis for the most important contemporary studies, which
drew from them serious conclusions that undermine the status of the
senior Companions and the members of the consultative committee
with regard to their religious commitment, good character and

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

593

sincerity. They depict these Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them) as materialistic individuals whose main concern was to
accumulate wealth and power, even if that was at the expense of
Muslim lives. They also suggest that the turmoil that led to the
murder of 'Uthmin (&) and the Battle of the Camel only came
about because of these personal ambitions.z36The contradictions and
oddness of these reports are quite clear in the texts themselves. The
idea that Ibu 'Abhis came to Madinah after allegiance bad been
sworn to 'Ali
is contrary to the trustworthy reports that say that
he came before allegiance was sworn to the new caliph, as we have
seen above. The idea that al-Mugheerah suggested to 'Ali (&) that
he should send for Abdullah ibn 'Amir, Mu'zwiyah and 'Uthmh's
governors in order to confirm their posts, is contrary to sounder
reports which indicate that most of these governors had already left
their posts and headed towards Makkah, so how could he send for
them to confinn their posts when they had already left their cities?

(4)

The idea that 'Ali (&) said concerning these govemors: "By
Allah, if I had only a brief time to decide about them, I would not
have confirmed their position, and people like them are not to be
appointed as governors" is contradicted by the fact that these
govemors were clearly qualified for their positions, and the borders
of the Islamic state had expanded under their leadership. Under the
governorship of Abdullah ibn 'Lmir, the Muslim conquests of Basra
had reached as far as Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. As for
Mu'iwiyah, if he was not qualified, he would not have lasted as
governor for twenty years. I have explained that the reason why a
number of people were not pleased with 'UthmZn's governors was
because of the rumours about them that were spread by those who
wanted to stir up the turmoil, not because they were incapable, and
the historical facts confirm that.

594

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Ta'lib
I

A worthless report depicts al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah as a
hypocrite and a cheat who did not care about Muslim interests,
especially at that critical time of turmoil. But this is not in accordance
with his attitude and conduct before and after the turmoil. The report
also - albeit with good intentions - depicts 'Ali (&) as ignorant
h Ibn
of these political issues and suggests that a l - ~ u ~ h e e r aand
'Abbb were the ones who were skilled in such matters.z37As for the
report of Abu Makhnaf that Ibn 'Abbis advised 'Ali to dismiss
Mn'iiwiyah and suggested that co-g
his post as governor
would not benefit him politically, this is contrary to the report of alWiqidi, in which it says that if he appointed the two great
Companions, Talhah and az-Zubayr, as governors of two regions of
Iraq, they would keep the financial resources for their own
purposes.238
The reports referred to above are worthless from the point of
view of the chain of narration, and this alone is sufficient reason to
reject them. But they are also odd and contradictory with regard to
the content. They are reports which are based on assumptions of
cause and effect. They do not transmit historical facts as they actually
happened, because of whims and desires and because of interference
on the part of the narrator with his RZfidi inclinations. All of that had
an impact on the reports.239
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali's appointment of new governors
would make people more responsive to swearing allegiance to him in
those distant lands, renew their energies for conquest and allow the
opportunity for new talents to emerge and strive to serve the religion
of Allah (3&).240
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) possessed
leadership talent and knew how to choose the right person for the
right job, and he knew what was happening at the time. He replaced
some governors when he thought it was appropriate, in order to

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

595

achieve administrative and political harmony between the caliph and
his helpers. 'Umar (&) dismissed some of the governors who had
been appointed by Abu Balcr (&), and 'Uthmin (&) dismissedsome of the governors who had been appointed by 'Umar (&). Thus
'Ali (&) had the right to dismiss governors if appointing others in
their places would be of benefit.z4'
Some contemporaq writers were mistaken with regard to
'Ali's dismissal of governors appointed by 'Uthmh, and they got
carried away in their attempts to explain this attitude. Some of them
interpreted it as 'Ali's being adamant in adhering to the truth and the
necessity of change. Others interpreted it as being due to 'Ali's lack
of political experience; they said that it may have been more
appropriate politically to leave the governors, especially Mu'iwiyah,
in place until the situation stabilised and allegiance
could be sworn to
.
'Ali in the regions. These opinions are based on worthless and weak
reports that describe al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah as giving
contradictory advice about this
Moreover, as the leader, 'Ali (&,) had the right to dismiss all
the governors of 'Uthmin if he thought that some interest would be
served by that. The Messenger of Allah (g),
.. who was infallible,
appointed Khilid ibn Sa'eed ibn al-'A$ as governor of Sari‘? and
' A m ibn al-'As as governor of

Would any sensible person criticise Abu Bakr, 'Umar or 'Uthmh for
dismissing these capable governors? Each period has different
circumstances and situations that arise, hence a successor may
develop different views from his predecessor. The one who is present
sees what the one who is absent does not see?"
As for the view of some contemporary writers that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) dismissed all the governors of 'Uthmh
the fact is that dismissal only took place in the case of MuC%wiyah
ibn
Abi Sufyih in ~ y r i a ~ and
" Khilid ibn ~ b i l - ' & ibn H i s h h in
~ a k k a h ? ~As
' for Basra, Abdullah ihn 'Amir had left it, and
'Uthmih (&) did not appoint anyone in charge of it.253In Yemen,
its govemor Ya'la ibn Maniyyah (&) took the tax collected from
Yemen and came to Makkah after the murder of 'Uthmgn, where he
joined Tabah and az-Zubayr and was present with them at the Battle
of the Camel. Ibn Abi Sarh, the governor of Egypt, came and
appointed his cousin in charge in his absence, but when he went back
he found that fin Abi Hudhayfah had taken over; he was expelled
from Egypt and went to ar-Ramlah in Palestine, where he remained
until he died.Z54Thus the governors of Yemen and Basra dismissed
themselves, and the govemor of Egypt was dismissed by the one who
took it over, Ibn Ahi Hudhayfah. The governor of Kufah was
confirmed in his position by 'ALi (&)
So the issue of dismissal was only applicable in the case of
MuC2wiyah,the governor of Syria, and Khsid ihn ~bil-'AS,the
govemor of Makkah. Moreover, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
appointed the best of people to rule over the Muslims. Among the
governors whom he appointed in various regions was Sahl ibn
Haneef in Syria; he was a great Companion who was present at Badr
and Uhud. He stood firm with the Prophet (@) on the day of L3ud;

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

597

when the people fled, he pledged to fight to the death and began
shooting arrows in defence of Messenger of Allah (&I.
He was also
present at the Battle of the Trench and all other battles with the
Messenger of Allah (g).255 'Ali (&) appointed 'Uthmh ibn
Haneef as governor of Basra; he was a Companion, one of the An&,
who had worked for 'Umar as a governor in Iraq.256He (&) also
~he
appointed Qays ibn Sa'eed ibn 'UbZdah as governor of ~
was a generous, wise and intelligent man who had been in charge of
the police force of the Prophet (g).258He appointed 'Ubaydullah ibn
al-'Abbh ibn ' A b d u l - ~ u ~ b - agovernor
s
of Yemen; he was a
who was one year younger than his brother, and be
was generous, praiseworthy and noble.260
As for the view of some writers, that 'Ali (&) dismissed
governors before receiving the oath of allegiance of the people of the
regions, it should be understood that the rnler's right to appoint
governors over various regions does not depend on receiving the
allegiance of their people, according to all Muslims. When the
prominent people and decision-makers swear allegiance to the caliph,
then allegiance to him becomes binding upon all lands that are
remote from the centre of the caliphate, on the basis of both Sharia
and reason. If the caliph's appointment of governors in the regions
depended on his receiving allegiance from their people, then one
could say that allegiance to Abu Ba!a (+&) was not completed when
he sent the army of U s h a h and sent troops to fight those who
withheld zakih before he received the allegiance of the people of
Makkah, at-Ti'if and JawZthi in Bahrain. The same may also be said
of 'Umar (&); he began his caliphate by dismissing Kh%d ibn alWaleed and appointing Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarr& as commander in
chief of the Muslim army in Syria, and this was before he had
received the allegiance of the people of Yemen and the Muslim
armies in Syria and Iraq. 'Uthmib (+&) also took decisions

~

598

Governors at the time of 'Aliibn Abi Ttlib

concerning the Muslims' affairs before the allegiance of the regions
reached him?61

2.1.2. 'Ali's appointment of some of his
relatives as governors
Contemporary writers discussed the issue of the appointment
of relatives as governors by the two caliphs 'Uthmh and 'Ali.
'Uthmh appointed a number of his relatives as governors, as has
been discussed, but only five out of eighteen governors were from
,.
was martyred, only three
Bann Umayyah. When 'Uthmib (&)
governors were from Banu Umayyah: Mu'iwiyah, Abdullah ibn
Sa'd ibu Abil-S& and Abdullah ibn 'Amir ibn Kurayz. 'Uthmh
dismissed al-Waleed ibn 'Uqbah and Sa'eed ibn al-'AS, but he
dismissed them from Kufah, from which 'Umar had dismissed Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqii~,too. Kufah had never accepted any governor, so the
fact that 'Uthmh (&) dismissed them should not to he regarded as a
criticism of them, and it does not undermine their status; rather it
undermines the status of the city to which they were appointed as
governors.262
Moreover, those governors who were relatives of 'Uthmh
(&) had already proven their ability in handling the affairs of their
provinces. Allah (&) had granted conquest of many lands at their

hands, and they had treated the people in a just and kind manner.
Some of them had been appointed to governorship before 'Uthmh's
caliphate, at the time of Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased
with them)?63 Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi (&) followed the same
method as 'Uthmh (&) in appointing those of his relatives who
were qualified, able and suited to the position of governor; they were
sons of his paternal uncle al-'AbbL ibn 'Abdul-Mu@h and their
names, in order, were: Abdullah ibn 'AbbL, 'Ubaydullah ihn
'AbbL, Qatham and T a m h the sons of al-'Abbh, and his stepson

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

599

Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. In fact, examining the issue will prove that
both 'Ali and 'Uthrnin appointed those they thought most suitable,
and it cannot be imagined that they would give precedence to their
relatives because of blood ties. The circumstances in the provinces
dictated careful selection of governors with regard to ability and
honesty. The conquests in the eastern lands were not yet stable, let
alone the problems caused by the Khanjites during 'Ali's
caliphate.264If we stndy the lineages of 'Ali's governors, we will find
that 11 out of 36 governors were Ansir while seven of them were
from Quraysh, among whom were the four sons of al-'Ahbis ibn
'Abdul-MutMb. The following is a list of govemors during 'Ali's
caliphate:265

601

'Uthmin and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) were two
Rightly Guided Caliphs whose example is to be followed and whose
deeds are to be regarded as constitutional precedents for this Ummah.
Just as 'Umar set a precedent for those who came after him of being
reluctant to bring relatives to help in managing the affairs of state,
'Uthmiin and 'Ali set a precedent for those who came after them of
bringing relatives close if they are qualified.z67

2.2. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali's keeping an eye
on his workers, and some of his instructions
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ( 4 ) kept a close eye on his
governors, checked on how they were doing in their jobs and
enquired about them. He employed a number of means of doing that,
such as sending inspectors to the provinces to ask the people about
them; asking some governors about others and instructing them to
check on them. He wrote to Ka'b ihn Msik: "Appoint someone to be
in charge and go out with a group of your companions until you pass
through the land of Kawrah as-Sawiid, then ask about my workers
and see how they are conducting themselves."268 'Ali ( 4 ) also
relied on secret reports sent to him by his inspectors in those
provinces, whose mission was unknown to the governors.269These
inspectors may have been employees of the governor or they may
have been others who were unknown; they may have been residents
of that province or they may have been moving from one province to
another. The existence of the secret reports is indicated by what was
written by 'Ali (&) to these governors, and perhaps the intervention
of some people between Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&) and his
governors was the reason for some of his governors giving up their
posts and refusing to continue working, such as the intervention of alAshtar between 'Ali and J m r ibn Abdullah al-Bajali, and the
intervention of some people between 'Ali and Mqqalah ibn

the door wide open for any complaints
against any of his governors, and if he heard a complaint about any of
them, he would say: "0 Allah, I did not instruct them to wrong any of
Your creation or to neglect Your rights."271 He detained one of his
governors and disciplined him and heat him with a stick after he
heard complaints about him and the accusations were proven."2
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was always advising his
governors. When he appointed Qays ihn Sa'd him as governor of
Egypt, he told him: "Go there, and take people whom you tmst and
love to accompany you. Take troops with you until you get there,
because that will he more frightening to yonr enemies and more
encouraging to your followers. When you get there inshallah, he kind
to those who do good, and he harsh towards those who do evil. Be
kind to the common folk and prominent people alike, for kindness is
a
Another example of his advice to Qays ibn Sa'd
appears in one of his letters, where he said: "Collect yonr tax on the
basis of tmth, treat your troops kindly and fairly and teach those who
are around you of that which Allah has taught
Some of the
letters that were sent to various regions appointing governors
included advice and instmctions, such as the letter that 'Ali (&) sent
to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr concerning the governorship of Egypt,
which he read out to the people. It contained some advice to the
public and to the governor h i r n ~ e l f . 2 ~ ~
There was frequent communicationbetween 'Ali (&) and his
governors, whether it took the form of written or verbal messages or
of direct commnnication, which took place primarily when the
governors came to Kufah to meet Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali or when
they joined him in fighting the Kharijites and others. There is no
report to suggest that Amir al-Mn'mineen went for hajj and met his
governors during the pilgrimage while he was the caliph, as was the
way of the previous caliphs; rather he would send one of those whom

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

603

he trusted as his deputy, such as the sons of al-'Abbss and others. The
governors of the East were in contact with 'Ali more often because
they were closer to Kufah and their delegations came to the city more
often. 'Ali often gave instructions in the form of advice explaining to
them how to do their work; sometimes this advice was written, and
other times it was verbal. One of the letters of Amir al-Mu'mineen to
his workers says: "You are the keepers of the people's treasure, the
representatives of the Ummah and the envoys of the rulers. Do not
prevent anyone from meeting his needs, and do not prevent him from
seeking what he wants. When collecting the land tax, do not force the
people to sell their winter or summer garments, any mount they need
for their work, or any slave. Do not whip anyone for a dirham, and do
not touch the wealth of anyone, whether he is a Muslim or a nonMuslim who has been granted protection."276
Some of the chiefs brought a complaint to 'Ali (4)
about one
of his workers, so he wrote to that worker, saying: "Some of the
chiefs of your people complained about your being harsh,
hardhearted, disrespectful and hostile. I studied the issue, and I
realised that they are not fit to be brought close to you because they
are polytheists, but they should not be pushed away altogether or be
treated cmelly, because of the covenant. So wear for them a garment
of softness mixed with a little strictness, alternating between
strictness and kindness towards them, bringing them close to you
sometimes and keeping them away from you sometimes,
in~hallah."~~~

2.3. The extent of power and authority granted
to governors of the time of 'Ali (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) refused to grant all authority to
a single person; his principle wwas to distribute powers and limit
individual authority. He appointed Ibn 'Abbb as governor of Basra,

604

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

but he appointed Ziyid in charge of the land tax and the public
treasury. He did not stop there, though; he also ordered Ibn 'Abbis to
listen to and obey ~ i ~ i d This
? ~ ' was perfect administrative control.
Ziyid was to obey Ibn 'Abbis governor of Basra, and Ibn 'Abbis
was to obey Ziyid within the framework of his work in the public
treasury and handling the land tax. As for judiciary matters, 'Ali
(4)
appointed Abu al-Aswad ad-Du'ali in charge of them."'
In the covenant that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) drew up for
M i l k ibn al-Ashtar, we may note the powers granted to the
governors. We will try to make the picture clearer by mentioning the
following details:

2.3.1. Appointment of govemment ministers
Amir al-Mu'mineen said in the covenant he drew up for M % i
ibn al-Ashtar: "The worst type of government minister is the one who
was a minister for an evil person before him. The one who joined
them in their sin should not be part of your inner circle, for they were
the helpers of sinners and the brothers of wrongdoers. You will find
far better than them to take their places, among those who are as
smart and as competent as they are, who do not have burdens of sin
like theirs, who did not help the wrongdoer in his wrongdoing or the
sinner in his sin. These people will be less of a burden to you and a
better help to you; they will be more compassionate and loving
towards you."
In this text that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) wrote in the
form of advice, we may observe the following points:
(a)

Appointment of government ministers is part of the governor's
role.

(b)

The conditions according to which the governor must select
his ministers.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

605

(c)

What the relationship between the governor and the minister
should be like.

(d)

The role of the minister,

As for the number of government ministers, it was not
He referred to them in
mentioned by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
the plural, and it seems that their number was connected to how much
help the governor needed, because the role of the minister is to help
the governor in his job. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) listed the
following conditions for government ministers:

(4).

- The appointee should not previously have been a minister

for evil people.
- The governor should select one from among the total

number of ministers to be his deputy and helper in running
things. He should select him based on what 'Ali (&)
said:280"Then let the one who is more favoured by you be
the one who can utter the word of bitter trnth to you, and
the least helpful to you with regard to things that Allah
disapproves of for His friends, regardless of whether that
pleases you or not."281
- As

for their roles, they come under the heading of
assistance, but the specific details are for the governor to
decide, and he may determine the functions of his
ministers according to his needs.

- Contact between the ministers and the governor should he

2.3.2. Formation of consultative committees
This was to be done by seeking the help of scholars and wise
men, who are the decision-makers, and people of experience. The

606

Governors at the time o f 'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

following text is narrated concerning them: "And discuss a great deal
with the scholars, and talk with the wise people, so as to establish that
which serves the interests of your province and that which serves the
interests of the people."283
This text is a confirmation of the importance of bringing
together scholars and wise people in organised advisory committees.
They may be appointed by the governor or elected by the people.
There were no specific instructions from Amir al-Mu'mineen as to
how these committees were to be formed; he simply asked the
governors to "discuss a great deal with the scholars, and talk with the
wise people." As to how that was to he done, were they to meet on
the instrnctions of the governor, or were they to he elected by the
people? This is something concerning which Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) did not give definitive instrnctions; he left it to be done
according to circumstances which dictated how these committees
were to he selected, either by appointment of the governor or election
by the people. As for the role of this committee, it was to study and
research in order to define the general policies with regard to two
issues:
(a) Defining policies which served the interests of the province.
(b) Defining policies which served the interests of the people.

This meant drawing up the basic guidehes for everything that
had to do with senring the interests of the land and the people,
whether it was with regard to how the wealth of the public treasury
was spent; appointments to different administrative positions; or
offering services to different classes of traders, craftsmen and
farmers. This committee was more like what is known as a local
council that is established in the type of states where the system is
based on decentrali~ation.~~~
Elsewhere, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) mentioned the qualities required in these consultants and

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

607

assistants: "Then stay close to the people of dignity and prominent
people, those who come from righteous families and who have a
track record of good deeds; then those who are chivalrous,
courageous, generous, tolerant and easy-going, for they are among
the noblest of people and the best of them."285 Amir al-Mu2mineen
'Ali (&) mentioned the importance of taking care of these councils
and checking on them. He said: "And check on them the way parents
check on their child, and never think that it is too much to help them
in a way that strengthens and supports them. Do not think little of any
kindness that yon show them, because that will motivate them to he
sincere towards you and to think highly of you. Do not miss out on
taking care of their minor affairs while you are taking care of their
major affairs, for there is room for your small acts of kindness that
may benefit them, just as there is room for your major support that
they cannot do

2.3.3. Establishing and equipping the army
Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) said to M%k an-Nakha'i: "The
closest of your troop commanders should he those who would offer
the most help and support to the people under them. Be generous
with them from your resources so that they will have enough for
themselves and their families, and so that they will all focus equally
on jihad against the enemy, for your compassion towards them will
make their hearts inclined towards
What we learn from this
text is:
(a) It is necessary to have a military force to defend the province.
(h) Forming this military force and preparing it is the responsibility
of the governor, and expenditure on it comes from the provincial
treasury.

(c) Appointment of military commanders is the responsibility of the

608

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

governor, and there are conditions to which he must adhere
when selecting commanders for the m y . It is essential to take
care of the commanders so that they will all focus equally on
fighting the enemy.288 Your compassion towards them will
make their hearts inclined towards

2.3.4. Drawing up foreign policy in war and peace
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
,.
said to his governor MZlik alAshtar: "Do not reject a peace deal that your enemy calls you to if it is
pleasing to Allah, for in a peace deal there is rest for your troops, relief
from your distress and security for your land. But be very careful with
your enemy after the peace deal, for his aim may be to stab you in the
back. Be smart, for there is no room for thinking positively of your
enemy. If you reach a deal with your enemy and have a covenant with
him, then make sure that you fulfil the terms of the deal. Be honest
and sincere, and adhere to the deal regardless of the cost; there is
nothing among the obligations of Allah, that all people are agreed to
venerate despite the differences in their views and inclinations, that is
more important than fulfilment of covenants. Even the polytheists
among themselves adhere to fulfilment of covenants when they have
a deal that excludes the Muslims, because of what they realise of the
evil consequences of treachery. So never betray your covenants, and
never betray your enemy, for no one has the audacity to challenge
Allah except one who is ignorant and doomed. Allah has made a
covenant in His name a source of security among people by His
mercy, and He has made a covenant like a sanctuary in which they
seek protection and under the shade of which they find comfort. So
there should be no evildoing or treachery and no betrayal, and do not
enter a covenant that may involve ambiguity.290Do not resort to
misinterpretation after agreeing and confirming. If you have
committed yourself to something that is difficult for you but is

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

609

binding upon you by the covenant of Allah, do not try to nullify it
unlawfully, because your patience in bearing something that is
dacult for you, while hoping for relief and good consequences, is
better than committing an act of betrayal for which you fear bad
consequences and that will bring the punishment of Allah."
Based on this text, the governor may undertake the following duties:
-

Signing peace deals with neighbouriug states and nations.

- Preparing

for war and taking necessary precautions.
(These first two items - being prepared for war and
signing peace deals -will involve many activities such as
exchanging letters and delegates, exchanging visits and
holding dialogues.)z91

- Fulfilling covenants, which is one of the basic principles

of the Islamic religion that every Muslim must adhere
to.292Adhering to covenants and deals, according to Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali, was not only something theoretical
that was written on paper; rather it was a practical matter in
real life. Allah warned against breaking covenants in many
verses in the Qur'an. Allah (g)
says: dAnd fulfil the
Covenant of AUah [Bay 'ah: pledge for Islam] when you
have covenanted, and break not the oaths after you have
confirmed them - and indeed you have appointed Allah
your surety. Verily, Allah knows what you do) (Qur'an 16:
91). Allah also said: &d fulfil [every] covenant. Verily,
the covenant will be questioned about.) (Qur'an 17: 34)

2.3.5. Maintaining internal security
Maintaining internal security is done by following peaceful
methods. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) wrote to some of his
workers: "Some of the chiefs of your people complained about your

610

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

being harsh, hardhearted, disrespectful and hostile. So wear for them
a garment of softness mixed with a little strictness, alternating
between strictness and kindness towards them, bringing them close
to you sometimes and keeping them away from you sometimes."293
This policy is for the purpose of maintaining internal security; if
something happens to disturb this mission, then the role of the
governor is to try to solve problems in a peaceful manner that is
furthest removed from using force, rejecting the policy of using force
against the people.294In his letter to M2l& ibn al-Ashtar, 'Ali(&)
said: "Do not try to strengthen your authority by shedding blood that
is protected by divine law, for that is going to shake and weaken it; it
will cause its decline and loss."295

2.3.6. Fonning the judiciary in the province
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Then select to judge
between people one whom you think is the best of your people, one
who is unflappable, who does not get offended by opponents, who
does not get carried away if he makes a mistake, who would not
refrain from tuming towards the tmth when he recognises it, who
does not have greed and ambitions, who is not content with one
explanation only before listening to all others, who takes his time and
does not rush into passing judgement on ambiguous issues, who
relies most on evidence, who does not get annoyed with people
referring to him and coming back to him, who is most patient in
studying and examining the case until it becomes clear, who is the
most decisive once the verdict becomes clear in his mind, who does
not become too proud if he is praised and is not tempted easily. Such
men are few. Then check regularly on the way he handles cases, and
he generous towards him so that he will not be in a state of poverty or
need, and thus he will not need people. Show great respect to him, so
that no one could hope to get his way with him of people who are

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

611

close to you, and so that he can feel safe and secure with you from the
aggression of people close to
From this text we leam the following:
(a) The governor is responsible for appointing judges
(b) The governor is required to adhere to strict standards in
selectiug judges.

(c) The governor must take care of judges completely, so that
they do not feel that they need anything from others.297

2.3.7. Financial administration
The sources for financial expenditure in the province were
z a k a , charity, booty (ghaneemah and fay'), land tax revenues and
customs duties. These funds were to he placed in the public treasury,
which was the place where the Muslim public funds were collected.
There was a worker in charge of the public treasury who recorded all
the wealth that came into it and all expenditure that went out of it.
The public treasury played an important role in decentralised
administration. The wealth that was collected was spent first on the
province's affairs, such as employees, workers, judges, the needy,
development and so on. Whatever was left over was sent to the
capital of the caliphate. The public treasury was regarded as the heart
of the province which circulated blood through the veins of the
different departments.298

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Look at what you have
collected of the wealth of Allah, and spend it on those with you who
are in need and hungry."z99 As we have mentioned, part of this
wealth came from the land tax, which is a levy that was imposed on
cultivated land; it was the main source for paying salaries of those
employed by the province. Whatever was left over of that was to be
distributed to the poor and needy. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali said: "AU

612

Governors at the time of Xli ibn Abi Trilib

people are dependent on the land tax and those who pay it." What is
meant by people here is employees and soldiers in general, of whom
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "The affairs of the troops cannot
be sound without what Allah has granted of the land tax."
Amir al-Mu'mineen instructed the people to invest in the land
by developing and cultivating it. He said: "You should focus more on
developing and cultivating the land than on collecting the land tax,
because it cannot be gotten except by developing and cultivating the
land. Whoever seeks the land tax without developing and cultivating
the land will cause ruin to the land and the people."300 That is
because farming the land will provide additional financial resources
that may be useful for paying salaries and other expenses. Covering
this expenditure is done independently from the central government,
which has a share in these resources after the province takes what it
needs and sends the rest to the capital. Amir al-Mu'mineen (&)
said: "What is left over from that, send it to us so that we may spend it
on those who are with
Another important expenditure of the province was the
development of rivers. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi (&) wrote to
Qaraaah ibn Ka'b al-Anski: "Some of the dhirnmis and manual
workers mentioned a river in their land that disappeared and was
buried. They have the right that the Muslims should develop it, so get
together and see what you can do, then develop it and restore the
river, for by Allah, developing the lands around the river is dearer to
me than if they were to leave and fall short in their duties that could
serve the best interests of the land."30z

2.3.8. Workers who work for the governors,
and checking on them
Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "Then look at the affairs
of your workers, and employ them on a probationary basis. Do not

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

613

appoint them on the basis of favouritism and preferences, because
that will lead to injustice. Seek those who have experience and are
modest, people from righteous families who have seniority in Islam,
as they are nobler in character and better in background, have less
worldly ambitions and are more farsighted. Then be generous in
giving them salaries, for that will help them to take care of
themselves and make them have no need of what they are handling,
and leave them with no excuse to disobey you or betray you. Check
on their work, and send spies from among the trustworthy and loyal
people to spy on them, for your checking on them secretly would
motivate them to be sincere and kind to the people. If one of them
makes a treacherous move, you will get news of him through your
spies, and that will be proof enough for you; then you will be able to
punish him physically and hold him responsible for his mistakes in
his work, and to bring humiliation upon him and label him as a
betrayer, putting around his neck a necklace of shame."303
Here he is talking about employees who work under the
governors and are in charge of cities and villages, as well as tax
collectors. They shoulder a great responsibility because their work is
directly connected to the people. From this text, the importance of
these workers in the administrative system becomes clear, because
they represent the executive authority. It is essential that their needs
be met, so that they will not covet the wealth or rights of others.304
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) pointed out the importance of spies or
watchdogs, whose job involves oversight of departments,
administrative bodies and the treasury. They are to be appointed
by the governor and are responsible to him. They should be people
who are sincere, so that their reports will be realistic and true. They
should also be loyal, so that their aim is to serve the state sincerely.
After they submit their reports to the governor, he should
carefully verify what is in these reports and not hasten to pass

614

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

judgement on individuals. One of the roles of this department is to
keep a watchful eye on merchants and tradesmen, so as to prevent
them from hoarding and causing harm to the people. In his letter to
al-Ashtar, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) indicated that the
governments of the Rightly Guided Caliphs had always been directly
concerned with the people's affairs; they monitored their situation
and tried to find out about any shortcomings at both the individual
and group level. This is a Qur'anic principle which Allah ( B )stated
on the lips of the prophet Snlaymh (@): (He inspected the birds,
and said: 'What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe? Or is he
among the absentees? I will surely punish h i with a severe torment
or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason.') (Qur'an 27: 2021) Just as Sulaymh (,@) checked on the birds, the caliphs were
required to pay attention to every individual and to show care to each
one, especially the weak. No doubt the leadership requires
committees, institutions and departments so that it will be able to
cany out this great task. Snlaymzn
was concerned with
following up on the troops and tradesmen, especially if he was
suspicious about their situation, so when he did not see the hoopoe,
he hastened to ask: "What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe?"
Meaning, "Is he absent?" It is as if he was asking whether what he
thought was correct.305 Tben he said: "Or is he among the
absentees?" This second question was asked in a more stem tone,
after be asked the first question in a gentle m,anner. Sulaymh (@)
wanted it to be understood that be was asking about one who was
absent, not only out of compassion, but also out of strictness if his
absence was not due to an excuse.306The era of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them) represented a practical
implementation of the Qur'anic concepts. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) highlighted the importance of the Muslim state's security
apparatus, which sought to gather news and information so that it
could be employed in the senrice of the religion, spreading sublime

(m)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

615

principles, noble aims and perfect examples, and putting an end to the
seeds of corruption in the different departments on which the
administration of the state was based.

2.3.9. Levels of society
Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&) said: "It should he noted that
the people are of different levels; they cannot he sound except with
the help of one another and they cannot do without one another.
Some of them are the troops of Allah, some of them are scribes both
public and private; some of them are judges who judge on the basis of
justice; some of them are government employees (civil servants) who
deal with people directly; some of them are people among the
dhimmis who made a covenant with the Muslims, who pay the jizyah
and land tax; some of them are merchants and tradesmen; some of
them are the lower levels, the needy and poor. For each of them,
Allah has stated the dues and entitlements in His Book or in the
Snnnah of His Prophet (@J, and it is a covenant from Allah to which
we adhere... None of them can do without tradesmen and craftsmen,
what they set up of businesses and market^,^" and what they could
supply and do that others cannot do. Then there is the lowest level of
society, people of need and poverty, who are entitled to help and
support."
Then he enjoined kindness to the merchants and craftsmen,
saying: "Then be kind to the merchants and craftsmen, and advise
others to he kind to them, both those who are settled and those who
are travelling with their wealth, and the one who puts up with
physical hardship during travel. They are the ones who bring all
benefits and different types of goods from far and wide, which people
cannot go and bring for themselves and would not have the courage
to do so. They are peaceful, and there is no fear of them causing
trouble. Check on the affairs of those who are around yon in your

616

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

provinces and those who are scattered in other areas of the province.
You should be aware that many of them are stingy and miserly, and
that they may resort to hoarding what people need and trying to
control the prices. That is harmful to the public, and it is something
shameful for the province to allow. So prevent boarding, for the
Messenger of Allah (g)
forbade it. Transactions should be done on a
tolerant and easy-going basis, on the basis of fairness and on the basis
of prices that are not unfair to either party. Whoever engages in
boarding after yon have forbidden it, punish him, but without going
to extremes."308
We may note from the words of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
that the merchant class is one of the most important sectors of society.
Hence he advised his governors to pay attention to them by creating a
department to take care of this sector and supervise their work, so that
they would not behave in a negative manner, such as being stingy or
hoarding and the like. Craftsmen are subject to the same problems as
merchants, so it is essential that there should be a department to take
care of them and help them to do their
Another of these sectors, or levels, of society are the people
who pay the land tax; they are the ones who work the land by
fanning, tilling and digging wells. They need attention and the
formation of committees to be in charge of them and to solve the
problems they are facing, because this is the way to develop and
invest in the land.
Another level is the dhimmis who live and work in the Islamic
state. It is essential for the state to monitor their affairs through a
department that looks after their economic and social affairs.310
Then there is the last level, that of the poor and needy,
including those who are in severe poverty and the chronically ill.
This level includes both the beggar and the one who does not ask, as
well as orphaned families and the elderly who have no means of

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

income, but would not ask for themselves. The state is responsible for
taking care of them completely by addressing their social, economic
and educational needs. The governor has to set aside time to meet
with them so that they will not feel deprived, and he should check on
their situation himself, directly. He has to create the right
environment so that these deprived people have the oppomnity to
speak to the governor.311

2.3.10. Training, and disciplining with
reward and punishment

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
said: "The one who does good
and the one who does evil should not be treated equally, because that
will make those who do good lose interest in doing good, and will
encourage the evildoers to persist in doing evil. Treat each one of
them in the way he deserves. Remember that there is nothing that the
leader can do to make the people under him think more positively of
him better than treating them kindly, reducing the burden on them,
and refraining from forcing them into something that is beyond them.
Doing this will create an atmosphere of mutual bust and positive
thinking, because mutual trust will prevent a lot of trouble. The one
who is more deserving of your trust is the one who tries his best to
help you. This is disciplining with reward and punishment. The noble
Qur'an speaks of this and clearly shows its features in the story of
Dhul-Qamayn, in which Allah ( B )says: 4He said: 'As for him [a
disbeliever in the Oneness of Allah] who does wrong, we shall
punish him, and then he will be brought back unto his Lord, Who will
punish him with a terrible torment Fell]. But as for him who believes
[in Allah's Oneness] and works righteousness, he shall have the best
reward, [paradise], and we [Dhul-Qamayn] shall speak unto him
mild words [as insbuctions].') (Qur'an 18: 87-88)"

The Rightly Guided Caliphs' method of leading by example is
what gave a strong incentive to the doers of good to increase their
good deeds. It also released the positive energies that made them do
more good and feel respected and appreciated, delivered a rebuke to
the evildoers so that they would give up doing evil, widened the
circle of good and righteousness in society, and narrowed the circle
of evil to the smallest possible diameter, according to the laws of
reward and punishment. This is what was taught by Amir d Mu'mineen 'Ali (&).

2.3.11. The role of the deputies and leaders
in bringing stability to the provincial system
The Muslims acknowledged the leaders in the second oath of
allegiance at al-'Aqahah, when the Messenger (g)
appointed twelve
leaders from among the Ans% over the people, three from the tribe of
al-Aws and nine from the tribe of a l - ~ h a z r a j . ~The
' ~ system of
leaders and deputies continued among the Muslim troops during
'Umar's time. In the battle of Qiidisiyyah, Sa'd ihn Ahi Waqqiis used
this concept to organise the m y , which was made up of a number of
assembled tribes. He appointed commanders for the troops and
appointed a deputy for every ten men. This system of deputies was
also followed at the time of the Prophet (g),
and that continued until
he began to allocate stipends and put in charge of the banners men
who had seniority. He also divided people into groups of ten, and
over each group, he appointed a man who was known for his service
to slam.^^^
'Umar (&) is regarded as the first one to organize people in
the regions into groups. Dnring this time, the role of the deputies in
the provinces became prominent, and they became responsible
before the governor for their tribes and the groups who joined them,
according to the way in which people were organized at that time.314

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

619

The system of deputies continued throughout the reigns of 'Uthrnk
and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both). 'Ali (&) used to
gather the leaders and give them stipends, which they in turn divided
among the people under their
The govemors
benefited from the deputies in the administration of their provinces
with regard to various civil and military matters. They helped to
distribute the stipends to the people, to establish law and order in the
provinces, to search for those who were wanted for justice and others,
to mobilise the people quickly when needed and to consult with the
people. The leaders also played a role in finding out whose name was
to be added to the rolls for receiving stipends and whose name was to
be erased, and various other matters. Thus the deputies were among
the most important employees of the governors in the administration
of their regions, even though, in most cases, they were not fully
devoted to this job; they were no more than people who would help
when needed.

In many cases, the organization of people under the deputies
and leaders was done along tribal lines. When the number of nonArabs becoming Muslim increased, and they began to live in the
cities built by the Muslims, the organization of people along tribal
lines began to decline gradually.316Still, that system was in operation
for most of the time during the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
(may Allah be pleased with them).317
Also under the authority of the governors were some senior
army commanders whose role was to lead specific sections of the
army; they undertook conquests upon instructions of the govemors.
The commanders would also accompany the governor, who was the
war leader, in various campaigns and help him to organise and lead
the army.318 The commanders of mobilisation came after the
governor; after them came the commanders of the groups of ten, then
the banner carriers, then the commanders and tribal chiefs.319

The deputies would also listen to their people's suggestions
and complaints of social injustice and convey them on their behalf,
speaking in their name and defending their rights before the governor
and others.320

2.4. Administrative concepts of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
2.4.1. Emphasising the human element
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) wrote to one of his workers:
"Some of the chiefs of your people complained about your being
hanh, hardhearted, disrespectful and hostile... So wear for them a
garment of softness mixed with a little strictness, alternating between
strictness and kindness towards them, bringing them close to you
sometimes and keeping them away from you sometimes,
inshallah. "321 The leader should pay attention to the
psychological state of the people under h i and draw up his
administrative plan in the light of this reality. He should strike a
balance between the importance of keeping things in order and the
reality that results from human and psychological conditions. It is
wrong to base administrative theory on strict and fixed rules that do
not pay attention to the human factor or to the impact of
circumstances, as if the administrative system of any organisation,
system, movement, party, group or club is operating in a vacuum in
isolation from external and internal influences.32z

2.4.2. The experience and knowledge factor
In this regard, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) confirmed the
importance of the leader having experience and knowledge. If that is
the case, then he has the right to be obeyed; otherwise he should not
be obeyed. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said: "You should obey

the one whom you have no reason not to obey on the basis of his
ignorance."323 if he is ignoraat, then they have no reason to obey
him, because he may lead them to doom. He also said: "There is no
obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards
the

different issues, will end up committing disobedience towards the
Creator by doing something

2.4.3. Relationship between

the leader and the follower
This relationship is not to be based on hierarchy; rather it is to
be based on common interests between the leader and his followers.
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&>) said to his governor when he sent him
to Egypt: "There are matters that you have to deal with directly, such
as discussing with your workers matters that could not be dealt with
by correspondence; and dealing with people's needs, which your
workers could not handle, as soon as you hear about them."326Here
we see a situation that cancels out this hierarchy completely; if the
governor could not do this task, he may delegate this work to some
people whom he trusts. 'Ali (&) said: "Check on those people who
cannot meet you, people who are looked down on by others and to
whom people show disrespect; allocate to these people a man whom
you trust and who is pious and humble, and let him tell you about
their needs."327 This is clearly ignoring the bureaucratic attitudes that
assume that everything should be done in strict accordance with the
system, that no one has the right to go against the system, and that
whoever goes against it is seen as breaking the system.
Then Amir al-Mu'mineen (&) explained the harm that results
from irresponsible rigidity and adherence to procedure: "The
governors' creating a barrier between themselves and the people
represents a kind of hardship and lack of knowledge of what is

622

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Trjlib

happening; keeping away from them creates a banier that may make
them have no idea of what they are deprived of. A prominent man
may become insignificant in their eyes, and an insignificant man may
become prominent; what is had may become good and vice versa;
and trnth will be mixed with falsehood."328 This is the hann of
administrative procedures and strict adherence to them; matters
become ensnared in longer chains of procedures as they move from
one official to another and to a third and fourth and fifth, until they
reach the ordinsuy people. This procedural chain that is occurring
away from the direct supervision of the leader may tum things upside
down; thus what is minor becomes major, what is trne becomes false,
what is good becomes bad and what is had becomes good, as Amir
al-Mu'mineen (&)
said. This is the problem with bureaucratic
,.
systems, because they rely on chains of people through which
administrative matters go one after another, and the people get
diverted from their goals. The remedy offered by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) is not to create barriers between an official and
the people working under him, because doing that causes him to
change his decisions or to implement them in a very bad way that is
contrruy to the good that he was aiming for.
The mission or role of the leader is not limited to meeting with
the people nnder him; rather he should provide a secure environment
that enables the people nnder him to discuss their problems in a safe
ahnosphere and without any fear. The aim is not to have pointless
meetings; it is essential to create a suitable atmosphere for these
meetings so that they are useful. 'Ali (4)
said concerning that:
"Allocate some of your time for those who need something from you,
and sit with them in a public gathering. Show humility towards AUah
Who created yon, and keep away from that gathering your soldiers,
helpers, bodyguards and police, so that they may be able to speak to
you without stumbling over their
He sent a letter to his

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

623

cousin, Qatham ibn al-'Abbk, in which he said: "There should not
be any envoy between you and the people except your tongue, and no
gatekeeper except your face."330There are other texts confirming the
nature of the relationship between the leader and his followers and
stating that it should not be based on means or administrative
restrictions or procedures; rather it should be based on face-to-face
talk when there is a need for that.33'

2.4.4. Fighting rigidity
There are some administrative theories and systems which
lead to rigidity, a waste of time and effort, and neglect of people's
rights. Moreover, there are many ideas that no one thinks of
attempting in the first place, because it would take too long to get
approval for them through administrative channels. Hence Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) said that whoever gives in to slow procedures
will neglect rights and duties.?3z

2.4.5. Proper and fair supervision
Supervision is important in any administrative system. Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) referred to this supervision when he said:
"...and send spies from among the trustworthy and loyal people to
spy on them, for your checking on them secretly would motivate
them to be sincere and kind to the people."333 According to Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&), supervision and checking is a mercy and
support to the one who is supervised, so that he will continue to cany
out this work sincerely. Supervision must be done by people who are
sincere and honest, so that their evaluation will be fair and not
affected by whims and desires. This supervision is a helping factor in
achieving progress and motivating individuals to work and to be
honest in their work. Rigid laws have no place in the administrative
thought of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali when these laws and regulations

I

624

become obstacles preventing individuals from moving forward in the
system or a cause of rights and duties being neglected.334

2.4.6. Appointment to official positions
should be done in accordance with guidelines
and not personal connections
In this regard, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Mi (may AUah be pleased
with him) confinned his appointment of his governor in Egypt:
"Then look at the situation of your workers, and appoint them after
you test them; do not appoint them on the basis of favouritism or for
personal reasons. It is essential to cany out preliminary tests on a
person whom you plan to employ for some job. The leader has to
keep away from personal reasons when employing or promoting
people to high positions." Then Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) said:
"Then look at the situation of your scribes, and let the best of them be
in charge of your affairs,"335not the closest of them to your heart or
your family. There is no room for connechons and emotions; the
standard is the truth, in addition to the ability to do the job with
honesty and sincerity.'16

2.4.7. Proper management
Ln the letter of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) to al-Ash'ath ibn
Qays, this concept (of proper management) becomes clear: "Your
position is not a reward; rather it is a trust placed on your shoulders,
and you are responsible to those above
This indicates that
Amir al-Mu'mineen regarded administrative work as a trust, and the
person in a position of responsibility has to render this trust as is and
take care of it. He is responsible before Allah ( B )to do it properly,
and he is responsible before his superiors, "those above yon", as an
acknowledgement of the importance of the hierarchical system. This
was an important factor in bringing about the control and

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

625

administration that prevented all aspects of negligence and
deviation.338

2.4.8. Taking part in decision-making
If we reread these texts of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) that
encourage consultation, we will find that the point of this
encouragement was to create participation in decision-making. There
should not be just one person who makes the decisions, whether that
person is a military leader, a financial leader, a manager or an official
in a position of responsibility in any field. Joint decision-making
usually leads to the correct decision,339because many minds are
working together. It allows people with experience and knowledge to
contribute; the decision, which is based on comprehensive
discussion, will be agreed upon by many and thus will be closer to
being correct.340Seeking advice and discussion guarantees success.
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Mi
said: "Seek the advice of others, for
success lies in seeking advice."341

(4)

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did not define a particular way
or style for consulting and seeking advice; rather he gave us a general
principle and told us about the benefits of applying that principle. No
field is exempt from the need for seeking advice; it is necessary in
evesy activity in a person's life and becomes even more necessary
when the activity involves or affects a group of people and not just
one individual. If we examine these sayings, we will see that the
correct decision comes as a result of exchanging ideas,34z and the
importance of lengthy and comprehensive discussion on the part of
those who are in charge of reaching the right decision will become

2.4.9. Importance of making a good choice
of employees for the state and offering them
material and psychological protection
Making good choices will prevent problems that may arise as a
result of weakness in the employee or as a result of his not feeling
able to fit into the work environment. If we examine the letter of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4)
to M2ik al-Ashtar an-Nakha'i, we
will find the important conditions that he set out when selecting his
workers: "Then look at the affairs of your workers, and employ them
on a probationary basis. Do not appoint them on the basis of
favouritism and preferences, because that will lead to injustice. Seek
those who have experience and are modest, people from righteous
families who have seniority in Islam, as they are nobler in character
and better in background, have less worldly ambitions and are more
farsighted."344
These are many conditions, and they are not Limited to ability
to do the work; attention should also be paid to the psychological and
social aspects of the worker's character, so that he wiU not be
overcome by worldly ambitions and will not easily change his
intentions and goals. It is also essential to note his social attitudes and
lus ability to adapt to a new social environment. At this point the
responsibility of the governor comes into play: "Then be generous in
giving them salaries, for that will help them to take care of
themselves and make them have no need of what they are handling,
and leave them with no excuse to disobey you or betray you."345
Then he said: "When all these qualities are combined in an
individual, and he is paid well, then this will be a motive for him to be
sincere in his work and persist in his efforts to make the province or
the institution prosper." Elsewhere he says: "...he generous towards
him so that he will not be in a state of poverty or need, and thus he
will not need people. Show great respect to him, so that no one could

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

627

hope to get his way with him of people who are close to
These are the factors that protect senior officials from going down the
road of accepting bribes or selling out for money:
(a) Paying generously and covering all his needs so that he
will feel independent.
(b) Showing respect to him so that he will have job security
and feel that his post is safe.

What more could the employee want if his life is secure and his
job is stable? This type of security for senior state employees may
also he applied in large companies,
corporations and leaders of
Islamic movements; it is a comprehensive guarantee for the
employee that should be granted to the workers, according to the best
administrative principles. Even the Japanese administrative systems
do not grant the employee this level of security of life and provision;
the employee receives a fixed salary, but that salary may not be
enough to cover all his expenses, so what will he do in that situation?
His need may push him to commit immoral actions. The
administrative system of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
, .. dictated that
the employee should be given enough security and money so that he
could attain independence of means. In other words, it is not
sufficient to give a monthly salary only; rather the standard is to fulfil
all his needs and, moreover, to give him job s e ~ n s i t"Show

respect to him, so that no one could hope to get his way with him of
people who are close to

2.4.10. Learning from people of experience
People of experience are a source of real knowledge, and it is
natural that the seeker of knowledge can benefit more from traders
(people with real-life knowledge) than from those who studied
theoretical knowledge only. The Japanese benefited from this
principle when they turned their factories into universities in which

628

Governors at the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

new workers could learn and gain experience from those who came
before them. This principle was also spoken of by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&): "The best people you can consult are people
of reason and knowledge and people of experience and resolve.349
The best people you can consult are people of experience."350 He
also said, with regard to keeping company with people of knowledge
and experience: "The best people you can accompany are people of
knowledge and f~rbearance."~~'
These statements contain principles
that are aimed at preparing the Muslim to be successful in his life,
then building a society characterised by its continual
ad~ancement?~'

2.4.11. A compassionate, paternalistic approach
The governor is a father figure before he is a man of authority;
he treats his employees like he treats his own children. Just as the
father takes on the responsibility of raising his children, so the
governor takes on the responsibility of preparing senior employees of
the state. This is the principle that was adopted by the Japanese, and it
is the principle that we find confirmed in the words of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) when he advised M S i ihn al-Ashtar to be
kind to his employees and check on their affairs as parents check on
their child?53 The leader must treat his employees as a father treats
his son, taking care of him, overlooking his mistakes, and punishing
him only for the purpose of discipline.
These are some of the administrative principles that were
followed by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Abi T a b (&).
