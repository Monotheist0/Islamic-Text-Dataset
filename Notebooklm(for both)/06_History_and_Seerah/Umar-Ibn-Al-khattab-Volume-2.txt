The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khattiib
.. in
Dealing with the Governors

w

hen the Islamic state expanded during the caliphate of
'Umar, he divided the state into large administrative sections in order
to make it easier to rule it and to supervise its income. The conquests
were a primary reason for 'Umar's development of the state's
institutions, including that of governorship.

1. The Regions of the State
The division of the state into provinces is in some ways a
continuation of the division into provinces at the time of Abu Bakr,
with some changes in the governorship posts in many cases. There
follows a brief look at these provinces.

1.1. Makkah al-Mukarramah
During the period of 'Umar (&), the governorship of Makkah
was held by M*
ibn H d a h ibn Rabee'ah ibn 'Abd Shams.
Then Qunqudh ibn 'Umayr ibn Jad'k at-Tameemi became 'Umar's
governor in Makkah, and his case is like those who came before h i ;
there are no reports ofhow long he was governor or of any events that
occurred during his governorship. ARer him, N%fi'ibn al-H&th al-

26

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khatfrib

K h d i became 'Umar's govemor in Makkah. When 'Umar died,
Nzfi' was the governor of Makkah. The sources mention some events
that took place during his governorship, such as his buying the house
of S a f w k ibn Umayyah with the purpose of turning it into a prison;
that was narrated by ~ukhari.'
It is also nurated that Nzfi' met 'Umar in 'U8an when he
came for Hajj. 'Umar asked him:"Whom have you appointed over
the valley (meaning Makkah)?" N S ' said, "Ibn Abza." He asked,
"Who is Ibn Abza?" He said, "One of our keed slaves." He then
asked, "Have you appointed a fkeed slave over them?" He said, "He
is well versed in the Book of AUah and has knowledge of the laws of
inheritance." 'Umar said, "Your Prophet said, 'Allah raises some in
status by this Book and lowers others.""'
During 'Umar's reign, the most prominent development in this
provmce was the expansion of the H a r a m , when 'Umar bought some
houses that were next to the Haram and ordered that they be
demolished and the land incorporated into the sanctuary of the
Mosque, around which he bullt a low wall. Makkah was the place
where governors h m all parts of the Muslim world met with the
caliph 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb during the Hajj season, so Makkah
played a major role as one of the most important provinces in the
Islamic state at the time of 'Umar (&).

1.2. Al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah
The caliph was regarded as the primary governor of
Madeenah, because he lived there and so he was running its affairs.

When the caliph 'Umar was absent fYom Madeenah, he would
appoint someone to take his place in running its affairs. Sometimes
'Umar would appoint Zayd ibn Thibit (&,) to look after Madeenah
when he travelled or went for ~ a j j 'Umar
. ~ also appointed 'Ali ibn
Abi Tilib in charge of Madeenah during his absence on several
occasion^.^ Thus 'Umar followed the same policy as the Messenger
of Allah WJ and Abu Bakr, of appointing someone in charge of
Madeenah during his absence. The governorship of Madeenah held a
particular importance in those days for a number of reasons, chief of
which was that it was the seat of the caliph 'Umar, the source of
commands and instructions that went out to the various Muslim
regions, and the starting point from which the mujdhid armies set out.
In addition to thaf it was the home of many of the Sahdbah (may
Allah be pleased with them) whom 'Umar prevented h m spreading
out to other regions.5 Hence many seekers of knowledge came to it,
wanting to learn the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (&J and
fiqh h m the lips of the Sahhbah themselves (may Allah be pleased
with them).6

At-T2if is regarded as one of the most important Islamic cities
It supplied tough fighters for the jihad
at the time of 'Umar
movement. Its governor from the time of the Messenger
was

governorship of at-T2if continued for two years of 'Umar's
caliphate, but 'Uthmh ibn Abi al-'& longed to go for jihad. He
wrote to 'Umar asking him for permission to go and fight, and 'Umar
said to him: "As for me, I will not dismiss you; rather appoint
whomever you want (to act as govemor in your absence)." So he
appointed a man from at-T2if to take his place.
'Umar appointed ' U t h h as govemor of Oman and ~ a $ r a i a ~ ,

Ya'la ibn Umayyah was one of Abu Bakr's governors in
Yemen, and he became famous during the caliphate of 'Umar ibn alKhatjtib. The historians state that he was subsequently appointed as
'Umar's govemor in Yemen and he was famous for that until 'Umar
died.13 Many sources describe events which happened to the
govemor of Yemen va'la ibn Umayyah) and some of the people of
Yemen, as well as mentioning some cases of complaints that they
made against Ya'la to 'Umar ibn al-Khagiib, which necessitated his
summoning Ya'la to Madeenah on several occasions to investigate
these matters.I4 When Ya'la was absent 'Umar would sometimes
appolnt someone else to take his place. 'Umar and Ya'la also
exchanged letters about some matters of zakah.15 Ya'la himself also
mentioned that he was one of the govemors h m whom 'Umar took
half of their wealth at the end of his caliphate.I6
Another of 'Umar's govemors in Yemen was 'Abdullih ibn
Abi Rabee'ah al-Makhzoorni, who was appointed over a limited area
of Yemen, namely al-Janad, as was stated by at-Tabari when he listed
him as one of 'Umar's govemors at the time of his death. He is
mentioned as 'Umar's govemor of al-Janad alongside Ya'la who is
described as the govemor of yemen.17
The people of Yemen played a major role in the conquests at
the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khatj5b (&). They participated in the

Undoubtedly these organized migrations of Yemeni tribes at
the time of 'Umar were planned, and the governors of Yemen played
a major role in that planning and in distributing the tribes among the
various regions. Hence Yemen was one of the most important Islamic
provinces at the time of 'Umar, and its role and influence in various
other provinces are quite clear."

When 'Umar became caliph al-'A12 ibn al-Ha&ami was
governor of B a a i n , and at the beginning of his caliphate, 'Umar
approved him as governor, until 14 A.H. according to the soundest
oPinion.Z2
AI-'A2 took part in the early stages of the jihad in Persia,
where he played a major role. Towards the end of al-'Al2s
governorship in B m , 'Umar issued a decree dismissing al-'A12
from the post of governor, and appointing him as governor of Bqra.
A1-'A12 was not happy about that, but he died before he reached
Bqra and was buried in B m . It was said that the reason for his
dismissal was that he went to fight the Persians by sea without
'Umar's permission, and 'Umar did not like to send the Muslims by
sea. After al-'A12 died, 'Uthmb ibn Abi al-'As was appointed as
governor of B b i n , and he started to wage jihad in the neighbouring

areas of Persia, until his conquests reached as far as al-Sind. 'Umar
issued orders to 'Uthmin ibn Abi al-'AS telling him to cooperate with
the govemor of Bqra, Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, in his conquests, so
their armies began to cooperate in attacking Persia via ~ q r a . ' ~
'Uthmin ibn Abi al-'AS was well known for his piety and his
strict avoidance of harim things. 'Uthmin was appointed as 'Umar's
govemor of B a a i n at least twice. He was appointed for the first time
in 15 A.H., then he was needed to lead the m y near Bqra, so
'Ayykh ibn Abi ~ h a w24
r was appointed as govemor of B w i n after
'Uthmin ibn Abi al-'AS. It seems that his time as governor was not
long. Then 'Umar appointed Q u W ibn M e o o n as governor of
Balpain, who was accompanied by Abu Hurayrah, who was
appointed as a judge in Bahrain as well as being given some other
duties. During Qudhah's governorship of Balpain, he was praised
by the people, but at the end of his governorship he was accused of
drinking alcohol. After the matter was investigated, the accusation
was proven to be true, so 'Umar carried out the hadd punishment on
him. 'Uthmin ibn Madh'oon was the maternal uncle of 'Umar's
children 'Abdullih andFafSah, and 'UthnGn got angry with 'Umar
but 'Umar tried to reconcile with him, and he used to say: "I saw in a
dream that someone came to me and said, 'Go and reconcile with
Qudhah, for he is your brother.' " And it was said that his dismissal
of Q u M from the post of governor of Balpin took place in 20
A.H. After that, the well-known Sahibi Abu Hurayrah (&) was
appointed as governor of Bahrain. He had undertaken some other
duties in B w i n during the governorship of Q u W ibn
Mamoon, and he was one of the witnesses who had testified against
Q u d h a h regarding his drinking. 'Umar issued a decree appointing

which led 'Umar to threaten to discipline him. 'Amr was the main
governor of Egypt, but there were other minor governors in Egypt,
such as 'Abdnllih ibn Abi as-Sa&, who was governor of as-Sa'eed
(Upper Egypt) at the time of 'Umar's death.29
We may note that during the governorship of 'Amr ibn al-'AS
in Egypt, 'Umar frequently intervened in many affairs of
governorship?0 'Amr ibn al-'AS made use of the Egyptians'
experience in matters of Wzardj andjizyah, and he employed them in
this work.31 It is well known that 'Amr did not allow his troops to
f m and become distracted by that, and he punished those who
disobeyed h i in that, acting on the commands of 'Umar ibn al~hattiib.3'
This naturally made the troops more devoted to matters of
..
jihad, as they did not have time to get used to a Life of ease and did not
become attached to the land. The troops were allocated salaries from
the bayt al-mil which meant that they had no need for that.
With support from the caliph 'Umar, 'Amr ibn al-'A? was able
organize the affairs of Egypt within a few years and it took its place
, a major Islamic province. A number of events took place there
which indicate that it was a stable province despite the dangers which
surrounded it, such as the ongoing attempts of the Byzantines to
recapture it by attacking Alexandria from the sea.
This province was fertile ground for the spread of Islam at the
time of the caliph 'Umar, because of the justice and mercy that
became widespread, which its people had never seen before, in
addition to their conviction of the truths of Islam. So they joined the
ranks of Islam.

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khagtlib

Administrative matters in Egypt ran smoothly because when
'Amr was the governor he was also responsible for the kharij, and
this did not prevent 'Amr h m asking other governors in areas under
his control for help, as we have stated above. But the principal
governor, who answered directly to the caliph throughout 'Umar's
reign, was 'Amr ibn al-'AS. 'Amr ibn al-'AS benefited from the help
of some of the local people in organizing the kharij and other
fmancial affairs.33

1.7. The provinces of Syria
When Abu Bakr w-Siddeeq (&) died, the one who was
responsible for the army and land of Syria was Khilid ibn al-Waleed
(&). When 'Umar became caliph, he issued a decree dismissing
Khilid ibn al-Waleed from the governorship of Syria and appointing
Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jam* in his stead, to be in-charge of all the
governors of Syria and to govern the Muslim community there.34
When Abu 'Ubaydah was appointed governor of Syria, he started to
organize its affairs and he appointed agents to act on his behalf in
various regions of Syria. He began to reorganize its affairs as there
were already agents in some regions, some of whom Abu 'Ubaydah
approved of and others he dismissed. Khaleefah ibn Khayyi? says:
"When Abu 'Ubaydah conquered Syria he appointed Yazeed ibn Abi
Sufiyih over Palestine and its environs, S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah over
Jordan, Khilid ibn al-Waleed over Damascus, and Habeeb ibn
Muslimah over Homs, then he dismissed him and appointed
'Abdull* ibn Qar! ath-Thamili3S, then he dismissed him and

reinstated 'Abdullih ibn ~ a @ . ~ ~
Sometimes he would send some of his companions to govern
certain areas of Syria for a specific length of time, such as when Abu
~ ~when
,
he
'Ubaydah sent Mn'idh ibn Jabal to govern ~ o r d a n or
appointed people in his stead when he went out for jihad. He
appointed Sa'eed ibn Zayd ibn 'Umar ibn iVufay13' in charge of
Damascus when he went out to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).
Throughout his governorship of Syria Abu 'Ubaydah (may Allah
have mercy on him) was an example of a righteous and pious man
whose example was followed by his fellow governors and by the
common folk. He was martyred, as we have mentioned above, in the
plague of 'Arnwk, then Mu'iidh was appointed as governor after
him, but he was martyred a few days later. When 'Umar ibn alK h a e b (&) came to know of the deaths of Ahu 'Ubaydah and
Mu'Xh, he appointed Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyk (&) as leader of the
Muslim troops in Syria and he sent other different commanders to
different parts of Syria. Yazeed was experienced in leading armies,
and had been at the head of one of the armies that Abu Bakr had sent
to conquer Syria. Abu 'Ubaydah also appointed him as his deputy in
charge of Damascus on a number of occasions when he went out on
campaigns.39The historians state that when 'Umar appointed Yazeed
in charge of the armies of Syria, he appointed other commanders and
distributed them throughout the various regions, and he put Yazeed in

period as governor in
charge of Palestine and ~ o r d a nYazeed's
Syria was short, hence there is little mention of him in the historical

sources. Yazeed died in 18 A.H. Just before his death he appointed
his brother Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Sufiyk to his position, and he wrote
to 'Umar informing him of that. Yazeed's period of governorshipwas
approximately one year.41
'Umar (&) approved of Mu'zwiyah as govemor and he made
some adjustments in the running of Syria's affairs after the death of
Yazeed. He limited Mu'iwiyah's authority to the garrison of
Damascus and collecting its kharij; he put limits on Mu'5wiyah's
authority with regard to the judiciary and prayer, when he sent two
other Companions of the Messenger of Allah @) whom he put in
charge of the judiciary and of prayer.42 This was a limitation of
Mu'iwiyah's authority, especially since the prayer was delegated to
someone else, although usually the leader also led the prayers.
Perhaps there were reasons why 'Umar adopted this new policy
which began to appear in other regions where he took the same
approach as he did wit. Mu'iwiyah. Mu'gwiyah was well known for
his forbearance and generosity which made some groups of people
come from Iraq and elsewhere to live in his province.43 'Umar
appointed some agents in Syria, whom he put under the authority of
Mu'iwiyah. During Mu'zwiyah's governorship of Syria, he
undertook some campaigns against the Byzantines in the north of
Syria; these were known as a?-SdJif(the summer campaigns)."
Mu'iwiyah continued as the govemor of Syria for the
remainder of 'Umar's caliphate. There were other governors in some
regions of Syria who were in direct contact with the caliph in
Madeenah, but Mu'iwiyah is regarded as the most famous of them,

Some historians describe him as the governor of Syria whilst others
are more circumspect, describing him as 'Umar's governor over part
of Syria. Some of them state that before 'Umar died, he gave
Mu'iwiyah ibn Ahi Sufiyin authority over all of ~ y r i a . 4It~must be
noted that there were ongoing changes in all provinces, based on
changing military circumstances and the circumstances of the state in
general in those days. Jordan was sometimes a separate province and
was sometimes joined to other regions; sometimes some regions
would be taken kom it and added to Syria or Palestine, and so on.47

1.8 Iraq and Persia
The conquests in Iraq began during the days of Abu Bakr. At
fist they were led by al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah ash-Shaybini, until
Khilid ibn al-Waleed came to Iraq, then he was appointed as
governor. When Abu Bakr ordered Khilid to go to Syria, he
reinstated al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah as governor. When 'Umar ibn
al-Khagb (&) became caliph, he dismissed al-Muthanna and
appointed Abu 'Ubaydah ihn Mas'ood ath-Thaqafi. Al-Muthanna
was dismissed at the same time as Khilid was dismissed, which
astonished the people, but 'Umar said: "I did not dismiss them
because of any wrong that they did; rather the people exaggerated
about them and I feared that the people would depend on
Despite his dismissal, al-Muthanna was a sincere soldier who

participated with Abu 'Ubayd in most of his battles and did well.49
After Abu 'Ubayd was martyred, al-Muthanna was reinstated
as leader, then Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& was appomted as commander of
the army in Iraq. The wounds that al-Muthanna had received on the
day of al-Jasr got the better of him and he fell sick and dled before
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi~reached I-.~' Bqra had just started to appear
on the stage of provincial events before the battle of al-Qusiyah, but
the vlctory of al-Qidisiyah and the fall of al-Madi'in to the Muslims
are regarded as the beginning of a new stage in Iraq, where the
provinces took on a certain shape and their general features began to
become clear, whether in Bqrah and in Koofah and their surroundmg
towns and villages which were regarded as part of them or m other,
separate provinces in ~ersia."

of Bani Sa'd ibn Bakr to the area of Bqrah before it was founded, to

'Umar ibn al-Kha@b sent 'Utbah ibn Ghazwiu to Bqra with a troop
of soldiers, and appointed him as governor thereof. That took place in
14 A.H., not in 16 A.H., as Sdih b
d al-'Ali said: "Some
historians think that 'Utbah was sent in 16 A.H., after the battle of alQ s s i y a h or Jaloola', but the overwhelming majority of historians
say that he was sent in 14 A.H., which makes us think that that is
more likely to be the case."53

The appointment of 'Utbah as governor of Basra was an
important stage in the founding of this province. His era was filled
with many great works, such as his conquests of parts of Persia that
s.~~
lay near to him on the banks of the Tigris and the ~ u ~ h r a t e'Utbah
asked 'Umar to relieve h i of the duties of governor, but 'Umar
refused to do so; that took place during the Hajj season, when 'Umar
insisted that he go back to his post. 'Utbah departed hut he died on
the way back to Ba~ra.When news of his death reached 'Umar, he
said: "I killed him, were it not that his appointed time had come," and
he spoke highly of him and praised him. His death occurred in 17
A.H." Then al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah was appointed after him, and
he was the first one to set up the records of Bwra. He remained
governor of Bqra until 'Umar dismissed him in 17 A.H., after alMugheerah was accused of zind. 'Umar investigated the matter and
proved al-Mugheerah's innocence, and he had the three witnesses
flogged, but 'Umar dismissed al-Mugheerah so as to be on the safe
side and to protect the public interest, but 'Uma appointed him as
governor elsewhae after that.56
After the dismissal of al-Mugheerah ihn Shu'bah, 'Umar
appointed Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari (&) as governor of Bqra. Abu
Moosa is regarded - and rightfully so - as the most famous
governor of Bqra during the days of 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib.
Numerous places in Persia were conquered during his time. He used
to engage in jihad himself and he sent commanders to many places in
Bwra. During his period, the troops of Basra managed to conquer alAhwk and its environs, and they conquered a number of important
places. The period of his governorship was filled with jihad.

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn a l - K h a M b

Abu Moosa cooperated with the governors of neighbouring
provinces in many wars and conquests. He undertook great efforts to
organize the conquered regions and appointed agents to help secure
them and organize their affairs.
There was a great deal of correspondencebetween Abu Moosa
and 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib on numerous issues, such as 'Umar's
advice to Abu Moosa on how to receive people in his majlis, and his
advice to Abu Moosa to fear AUah and try to help the people. This
was valuable advice, in which 'Umar said: "The happiest of people is
the one under whose care people are happy because of him, and the
most miserable of people is the one under whose care people are
miserable because of him. Beware of indulging in worldly pleasures
or allowing your agents to do so, lest you become like an animal that
sees some vegetation and starts grazing it, aiming to get fat, buts its
death is in its fat."57
There is also some correspondence between 'Umar and Abu
Moosa which points to various administrative and executive issues
which Abu Moosa undertook on 'Umar's instructions. Most of this
correspondence has been compiled by Muhammad Hameedullfi in
his valuable book on political documents.58
Abu Moosa's governorship of Bqra is regarded as one of the best
periods, as described by one of the descendents ofthe people ofBwra,
al-Hasan al-Basri, who said: 'Wo rider ever came to Bwra who was
' addition to being the
better for its people than Abu ~ o o s a . " ~In
governor of B w , Abu Moosa was also the best teacher for its people;
he taught them the Qur'an and taught them about their religion.60

During the caliphate of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, many cities in Persia
which were conquered at that time became subject to Basra and were
run by the governor of Basra who appointed agents in charge of
them; those agents were in direct contact with him. Thus Abu Moosa
is regarded as one of the greatest governors of 'Umar and the
correspondencebetween 'Umar and Abu Moosa is regarded as one of
the greatest sources of information on the way that 'Umar interacted
with his

1.8.2. Koofah
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& is regarded as the first governor of
Koofah after it was founded; indeed he is the one who founded it,
acting on 'Umar's instructions. He was the governor of Koofah and
the surrounding regions before Koofah was built. Sa'd remained the
governor of Koofab and played his role there to the fullest extent.
After settling in Koofah, Sa'd achieved great conquests in ~ersia?
Sa'd also introduced a number of agricultural reforms in his
province, such as when a group of local chiefs asked him to dig a
channel to serve the farmers in their areas. Sa'd wrote to his agents in
that area ordering them to dig a channel for them. So his agent
assembled some workers and dug it for them.
Sa'd organized the affairs of the regions belonging to Koofah,
and appointed agents in charge of them, after consulting 'Umar ibn
al-Khagb. The wise men of Koofab admired and praised Sa'd ibn
Abi Waqq2s.
When 'Umar asked Jareer ibn 'Abdullih ibn Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqq& about Sa'd and the way he was running the affairs of

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khanib

governorship, Jareer said: "I left him in his province the most noble
of men, with the strongest authority and the least harshness; he is like
a caring mother towards them. He is the strongest of men at times of
war and the most beloved of Quraysh to the people."63
Although the elite and wise men of Koofah accepted and
praised Sa'd, there were some complaints about him that were made
by some of the common folk, so he was dismissed, as we will discuss
more fully when we look at the complaints that were made against
governors. After the dismissal of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq&, 'Umar issued
a decree appointing 'Ammiribn Yair to lead the prayers in Koofah.
It may be noted that 'Ammir was one of the leaders in Koofah, and
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi~used to seek the help of those leaders during his
governorship. Hence 'Ammir had extensive prior experience of
govemorship before he was appointed as governor. 'Ammir's
govemorship differed kom Sa'd's, because 'Umar appointed other
people with 'Ammir to share the responsibility and undertake
different tasks. 'Ammirwas to lead the prayers, Ibn Mas'ood was in
charge of the bayt al-mril and ' U t M ibn Hunayf was in charge of
measuring land. Hence the situation differed somewhat to the
situation at the time of Sa'd. We cannot ignore this new distribution
of responsibility in the governorship. Each of them did the tasks that
were allocated to him. 'Ammir led the prayers, organized the affairs
of the province and led the army, and he achieved some conquests.
During his governorship the people of Koofah took part in a number
ofbattles against the Persians who had rallied their troops against the
Muslims. 'Ammir organized his province in accordance with this
war situation, following 'Umar's instrnctions. 'Ammir continued to
do his duties in the province of Koofah with Ibn Mas'ood who,
alongside his rnnning the financial affiirs of the province also taught

'Umar ibn al-KhaEdb

43

the people Qur'an and religious matters.64'Ammir's governorship of
Koofah lasted for approximately one year and nine months. 'Umar
dismissed him on the basis of a number of complaints made by the
people of Koofah against him. 'Umar said to 'Ammk "Are you
upset because of this dismissal?" ' A d said: "I was not happy
when I was appointed, but I was upset when I was dismissed." And it
was said that he said: "I did not feel happy when you appointed me
and I was not sad when you dismissed me."65 It is also reported that
he asked 'Umar to let h i off this job when he felt that the people of
Koofah did not like hi,so 'Umar let him off and did not dismiss
him.=
Then 'Umar appointed Jubayr ibn Mut'im as governor of
Koofah, then he dismissed him before he set out for Koofah, because
'Umar had ordered h i to conceal the news of this appointment, but
the news spread among the people, so 'Umar became angry and
dismissed him. Then he appointed al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah as
governor of Koofah and he continued in that post until 'Umar ibn alK h a g b (&) died.67

Al-Madgin was the capital of Chosroes, which was conquered
by Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq&. Sa'd settled there for a while, then he
moved to Koofah aRer it was founded. One member of Sa'd's army
was Salmh alLF2ris.i (&), who took part in a number of battles
against the Persians and played a major role in calling them to Islam
before fighting took place. 'Umar ibu al-KhaFib appointed him as

44

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khan&

governor of al-Madi'in and he treated it's people well. He was a
living example of the application of Islamic teachings. It is reported
that he would have refused the post of governor, were it not that
'Umas forced him to accept it. He used to write to 'Urnar asking him
to let him off, but 'Umas refused. Sahnin (&) was well known for
his asceticism. He used to wear wool, ride a donkey and eat barley
bread; he lived a very simple life.68
Salmin remained in al-Madi'in until he died, most likely in 32
A.H., during the caliphate of 'Uthmin ibn 'Affan. It seems that
Salmin was not the governor of al-Madi'in at the end of 'Umar's
caliphate, because 'Umar appointed Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamin as
governor of al-Madi'in, but the historians did not state that 'Umar
dismissed Salmin. Perhaps he asked 'Urnar to let him off and 'Umar
agreed after having refused to let him off, and he appointed
as govemor after him. There are numerous
Hudhayfah ibn al-Y&
reports which speak of Hudhayfah's appointment as governor of alMamin, such as the letter sent by 'Umar to the people of al-Madi'in
appointing Hudhayfah as their governor, in which ' U r n told the
people of a l - M a i n to hear and obey Hudhayfah. Hudhayfah
remained governor of al-Madi'in for the remainder of 'Umar's
caliphate and throughout the caliphate of ' ~ t h m i n . ~ ~

1.8.4. Azerbaijan
Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamiu was the first governor of Azerbaijan.
After he moved to al-Mamin, 'Utbah ibn Farqad as-Sulami was
appointed as governor of Azerbaijan. During his governorship there
was a great deal of correspondence between him and 'Umar. When
'Utbah ibn Farqad came to Azerbaijan he found that they had a kind

of sweet dish called al-khabees, so he decided to have some made for
'Umar ibn al-Khaeb; he wrapped it in skins and other things to
preserve it, and sent it to 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb in Madeenah. When
he received it, he tasted the khabees and l i e d it. 'Umar said: "Have
all the Muhiijireen eaten their fill of it?" The envoy said, 'Wo, it is
something that he made just for you." So 'Umar ordered him to take
it back to 'Utbah in Azerbaijan and he wrote to him saying: "0'
'Utbah, this is not from your wealth or the wealth of your fathers. Let
the Muslims eat their fill in their camps of what you have eaten your
fill of in your camp. Beware of luxury and of wearing the clothes of
the people of shirk and of wearing silk, for the Messenger of Allah
&) forbade wearing silk."70 This incident is narrated in numerous
reports which support one another. 'Utbah continued as governor of
Azerbaijan for the remainder of 'Umar's caliphate and for part of
'Uthm?in's caliphate.
There were a number of govemors in various regions of Iraq
and Persia during the time of 'Umar, some of whose provinces were
separate and others whose provinces were connected to one of the
two great provinces of hq where the administration of all of Iraq
and Persia was based, namely Koofah and Basra. Among the cities
which had their own governors were Mosul, Halwh and ~ a s k a r . ~ '

2. Appointment of Governors
at the Time of 'Umar
'Umar followed the method of the Prophet &) in selecting
govemors. He only appointed those who were qualified, trustworthy

'ala al-Buldin, 11133
Ibid, 11133, 134, 135.

70 Al-Wilryah

46

The Fiqh of 'Umau ibn al-KhaBrib

and more suited than others for this type of work, striving to make the
best choice. He did not appoint anyone who asked to be a governor.
He thought that selecting governors was akin to fulfilling a trust,
whereby he was obliged to appoint the best man he could find for
each post, and turning away kom the best candidate and choosing
someone else would be a betrayal of Allah, His Messenger and the
believer^.^' Concerning this, he said: "I am responsible for my trust
and what I am in charge of. I will examine all the issues myself,
insha 'Allih, and I will not delegate that to anyone. I can only rely on
those who are trustworthy and sincere towards the Muslims, and I
will not rely on anyone else."73 And he said: "Whoever appoints a
man over a group when there is a man in that group who is more
pleasing to Allah, has betrayed Allah, betrayed His Messenger and
betrayed the belie~ers."'~He also said: "Whoever is appointed in
charge of some of the affairs of the Muslims and he appoints a man
because of fiendship or blood ties, has betrayed Allah, His
Messenger and the ~ u s l i m s . " ~ ~

2.1. The most important bases on which
'Umar appointed governors and the
conditions he stipulated for them
2.1.1. Capability and trustworthiness
'Umar applied this principle and preferred more capable men
over others. He dismissed Shurahbeel ibn Hasanah and appointed
Mu'iiwiyah instead. S h d b e e l said to him: "Did you dismiss me

'Umar ibn al-Khattrfb

47

because you are not pleased with me, 0'Ameer al-Mu'mineen?" He
said, "No; I think well of you, but I wanted a man who is more
capable."76 One of the most eloquent comments namted from
'Umar concerning this matter is his saying: "0' Allah, I complain to
You of the capability of the evildoer and the incapability of the
trustworthy one."77

2.1.2. The role of knowledge in
appointment of governors

a)

'Umar followed the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah
in
appointing leaders of the army in particular. At-Tabari said: "When
an army of believers gathered around 'Umar, he would appoint over
them a man who had howledge and understanding of slam."^^

2.1.3. Knowing how to do things
'Umar ibn al-KhaGb appointed some people, and did not
appoint others who were of greater virtue than them, because the
former knew how to do things?' In this case, those whom 'Umar
passed over were better in terms of religious commitment and piety,
and better in character, but their experience in running affairs was
less than that of others. It was not essential to combine both factors.
This principle which was set out by 'Umar is still followed today in
the most advanced nations, where a man of religious commitment,
piety and good character who does not have any experience of
matters of government is more likely to be ensnared by the tricks of
those who follow their whims and desires. But the one who is smart

48

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

and experienced will grasp things quickly and understand what is
behind the spoken word. This is the very reason why 'Umar would
avoid appointing a man who did not know anything about evil. He
asked about a man whom he wanted to appoint as an agent and he
was told, "0'Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, he does not know anything about
evil." 'Umar said to the man, "Woe to you, he is more likely to fall
into it."80 This is not one of the characteristics required for
administration and d i n g , rather the criterion for determining who is
best suited for this field is knowledge of how to do the job."

2.1.4. Desert-dwellers and town-dwellers
When appointing governors and agents, 'Umar would pay
attention to their characteristics, natures, customs and habits. It was
known that he would not appoint a desert-dweller in charge of towndwellers.'' Thus he paid attention to social and behavioural factors
when selecting employees. Both desert-dwellers and town-dwellers
have their own natures, attitudes, customs and traditions, and it is
natural that the govemor should understand the mentality of those
under his care; it is not fair to appomt over them a man who knows
nothing of that, who may regard their customs as odd and their nature
as strange.83

2.1.5. Compassion and mercy towards
those of whom he is in charge
'Umar (&) sought to achieve compassion and mercy towards
those of whom the governor was in charge. He often told the leaders

of jihad not to undertake unnecessarily risky missions and not to put
the Muslims in grave danger. 'Umar wrote to a man from Banu
Aslam appointing him to some position of authority. The man entered
to meet 'Umar and saw 'Umar kissing one of his children who was on
his lap. The man said, "Do you do this, 0' A m e e r al-Mu 'mineen? By
Allah, I have never kissed any child of mine." 'Umar said, "Then by
Allah you are the least merciful of people. You will never do any
work for me." So 'Umar rejected him and did not appoint hims4
One of his armies went on a campaign in Persia and reached a
river that had no bridge. The commander of the army ordered one of
his soldiers to go down on a very cold day and look for a place where
the army could cross. The man said: "I am a h i d that I will die if I
enter the water." But the commander forced him to do that. The man
entered the water, screaming, "0' 'Umar, 0' 'Umar! " and soon after
that he died. News of that reached 'Umar when he was in the
marketplace of Madeenah, and he said, "Here I am, here I am!" He
sent word dismissing the commander of that army and he said: "Were
it not for the fact that I do not want to set a precedent, I would have
retaliated against you. You will never do any work for me again."85
'Umar addressed his governors and said: "Know that no forbearance
is more beloved to Allah and more far-reaching than the forbearance
and kindness of a leader, and nothing is more hated by Allah and
more far-reaching than the ignorance and foolishness of a leader."86

2.1.6. He did not appoint any of his relatives
'Umar was keen to avoid appointing any of his relatives,
despite the fact that some of them were qualified and had come to

Islam early on, such as his paternal cousin Sa'eed ibn Zayd and his
son 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar. One of his companions heard him
complaining about a problem with the people of Koofah and their
governor, when 'Umar said: "Would that I could find a strong,
trustworthy, Muslim man to appoint over them." The man said, "By
Allah, I will tell you of one such, 'AbdulEih ibn 'Umar." 'Umar said,
"May Allah kill you! You did not say that for the sake of ~ l l a h . " ~ ~
And he used to say, "Whoever appoints a man because of fiendship
or blood ties, and for no other reason, has betrayed Allah and His
Messenger.

2.1.7. He did not appoint anyone
who wanted to be appointed
He did not appoint any man who wanted to be appointed.
Concerning that he said: "Whoever seeks this will not be appointed."
In this approach he was following the Sunnah of the Messenger @
- J.

2.1.8. Forbidding governors and
agents to engage in trade
'Umar forbade agents and governors to engage in trade,
whether they were selling or buying.89 It was narrated that an agent
of 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb whose name was al-Hirith ibn Ka'b ibn
Wahb started to show signs of prosperity. 'Umar asked him about the
source of this wealth and he replied: "I had some money and I
engaged in trade with it." 'Umar said, "By Allah, we did not send

51

you to engage in trade!" and he took fiom his the profits that he had
made.g0

2.1.9. Recording the net worth of his agents
at the time of their appointment
'Umar recorded the net worth of his agents and governors
before they were appointed, so that he could bring them to account
for any increase after their governorship that was not of a regular type
of growth. Some of them tried to justify engaging in trade, but he did
not accept what they said, and he told them: 'We have sent you as
governors, not as rner~hants."~'

2.1.10. Conditions stipulated by 'Umar for his agents
When 'Umar appointed an agent, he would write a document
for him, which he would have witnessed by a number of the An&,
stipulating that he would not ride a non-Arabian horse, he would not
eat fine bread, he would not wear fine clothes, and he would not close
his door to Muslims in need. Then he would say, "0' AUah, bear
witness."9z
These conditions obliged the governor to adhere to a simple,
ascetic life, and to be humble towards people. This is the first step in
reforming the ummah by making them accept a moderate standard of
living, clothmg and transportation. With such a lifestyle that was
based on moderation, its affairs would be set in order. This was a wise
move, because 'Umar could not force every member of the ummah to
do something that is not regarded as obligatory in Islam, but he could

force the governors and leaders to do that. If they committed
themselves to that, they would be setting an example in society. This
was a successll plan to reform society and protect it from the causes
of

2.1.11. Consultation when selecting governors
The selection of governors was made after the caliph had
consulted the senior ~ahibah." 'Umar (&) said to his companions
one day: "Show me a man who, if he is the leader of some people, it is
as if he is not a leader, and if he is not a leader, it is as if he is a
leader,"95 and they pointed out ar-Rabee' ibn
'Umar consulted the Sahibah as to whom he should appoint as
governor of Koofah, and said to them: "Who could tackle the
problems of the people of Koofah for me, and their false accusations
against their governors? If I appoint over them a man with good
morals, they will regard him as weak, but if I appoint over them one
who is strong, they will force him to overstep the limit w~ththem."
Then he said: "0' people, what do you say about a man who is weak
but is a pious Muslim, and another who 1s strong and tough but not so
religiously committed? Which one is better suited to be a governor?"
Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah spoke up and said, "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, the weak Muslim's commitment to Islam counts in his
favour but his weakness counts against yon and the Muslims; the fact
that the strong man is less pious counts against him but his strength
counts in your favour and that of the Muslims. So do what you think
is best." 'Umar said, "You have spoken the tmth, 0' Mugheerah."

Then he appointed him as governor of Koofah and said to hi,"Try
to be one whom the righteous trust and the evildoers fear." AlMugheerah (&) said, "I shall try my best, 0' Ameer alM~inineen."~'

2.1.12. Testing agents before appointing them
'Umar tested his agents before appointing them, and in some
cases this testing took a long time, as was stated clearly by al-t\hnaf
ibn Qays who said: "I came to 'Umar ibn al-Khasb
and he
kept me with him (in Madeenah) for a year. He said, '0' &at I
have been testing you and I have seen that you are outwardly good,
and I hope that you are as inwardly (good) as you are outwardly. We
used to say that this ummah will be doomed by knowledgeable
hypocrites.' Then 'Umar asked him, 'Do you know why I kept you
here?' He explained to him that he had wanted to test him, then he
appointed him as a governor.98 Among the advice he gave to al&af was the following, '0' &at one who laughs too much loses
dignity; one who jokes too much loses respect; whoever does
something a great deal becomes known for it; one who speaks a great
deal makes mistakes; one who makes many mistakes loses his sense
of dignity. Whoever loses his sense of dignity loses his fear of Allah,
and whoever loses his fear of Allah is spiritually dead.'"99

2.1.13. Making the governor one of the people

appointed some people as governors over their own people, if he saw

that that served a purpose and if the man was qualified to be a
governor. For example, he appointed Jibir ibn 'Abdullih al-Bajali
over his people ~ajeelah'OOwhen he sent them to Iraq. Similarly, he
appointed Salmin al-Fcsi over a l - M d i n , Nifi' ibn al-H&th over
Makkah and 'Uthmin ibn Abi al-'& over at-Ti'if. Perhaps there
were specific goals behind that, which these people were more able to
achieve than others.lO'

2.1.14. Letter of appointment
It was well known that when 'Umar had made his k a l
selection of a governor and had consulted his consultants, he would
write a document for the governor which was known as a contract of
appointment. Many such texts of appointment by 'Umar have been
narratedlo2,but most historians are agreed when 'Umar appointed an
agent or governor, he would write a document for him which he
would have witnessed by a number of the Muhtjiireen and An& and
in which he would stipulate certam condition^.'^^ If the person who
had been nominated as a governor was absent, 'Umar would write a
contract for him, in which he would instruct him to go to his new
province. For example, he wrote to al-'A12 ibn a l - H b i , his
governor in B w n , ordering him to go to Basrah and take over as
governor there after 'Utbah ibn Ghazwin. When he dismissed one
governor and appointed another, the new governor would take the
letter which included the decree dismissing the h t governor and
appointing h i in his stead. For example, 'Umar sent a letter with
Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari when he dismissed al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah

'Umar ibn al-Khat&b

55

from his post as governor of Ba~raand appointed Abu Moosa in his
stead.'04

2.1.15. Not seeking the help of a Christian
with the affairs of the Muslims
When news of the conquest of Syria came to 'Umar, he said to
Abu Moosa: "Call your scribe to read this to the people in the
mosque." Abu Moosa said, "He cannot enter the mosque." 'Umar
asked, "Why not? Is he junub?" He said, "No, rather he is a
Christian." 'Umar rebuked him and said, "Do not bring them near
when AUah has cast them away; do not honour them when Allah has
humiliated them; do not trust them when Allah has stated that they
are treacherous. I have forbidden you to employ people of the Book,
for they accept bribes."'05
It was narrated that usiqq'06 said: "I was a Christian slave of
'Umar's, and he said, 'Become Muslim so that we may appoint you
over some of the Muslims' affairs, because we cannot appoint over
their affairs one who is not one of them.' He set me free as he was
dying and said, 'Go wherever you ant.'"'^'

2.2. The most important characteristics
of 'Umar's governors
Among the most important characteristics of 'Umar's
governors were: strength of faith, Islamic knowledge, trust in Allah,

exemplary conduct, sincerity, being qualified for the post, courage,
chivalry, asceticism, love of sacrifice, humility, acceptance of advice,
forbearance, patience, ambition, resolve, strong willpower, justice,
the ability to solve problems, and other such characteristics.The most
important of these were:

2.2.1. Asceticism (Zuhd)
Among the governors of 'Umar who were well known for their
ibn Hudhayrn, 'Umayr ibn Sa'd,
asceticism were: Sa'eed ibn 'h
Sahnh al-Firisi, Abu 'Uhaydah ibn al-Jar& and Abu Moosa alAsh'ari (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wives of some of
his govemors came to 'Umar and complained because of their
husbands' asceticism. The wife of Mu'klh ibn Jabal
complained because 'Umar had sent Mu'klh to distribute shares
(from bayt al-mil) to some hibes, so he shared them out until there
was nothing left, then he came back empty-handed. His wife asked:
"Where is your share, that agents usually get for their families?" He
said, "Someone was watching me." She said, "You were trusted by
the Messenger of Allah @) and by Abu Bakr; why did 'Umar send
someone with you to watch you?" She went to her women and
complained about 'Umar, and when news of that reached 'Umar, he
summoned Mu'& and asked, "Did I send someone with you to
watch you?" He a d , "I couldn't find any other excuse to give her."
'Umar smiled and gave him something, and said, "Make her happy
with this."108

(4)

2.2.2. Humility
The governors at 'Umar's time were well known for their great
humility, such that when people came to their lands, they could not

'Umar ibn al-Khafftib

57

distinguish between them and the common folk. In their clothing,
housing and mounts they were like the ordinary people, and they did
not distinguish themselves from them in any way. An example of that
is the story of Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-J+
(&). The Byzantines sent
a man to h i to negotiate with him, and when he came close to the
Muslims, he could not tell Abu 'Ubaydah apart kom his companions;
he did not know whether he was among them or not, and he did not
feel that he was in the presence of a governor. He asked them: "0'
Arabs, where is your leader?" They said, "There he is." He looked
and he saw Abu 'Ubaydah sitting on the ground, with a bow on his
shoulder and examining an arrow that he held in his hand. The envoy
asked him, "Are you the leader of these men?" He said, 'Yes." He
then asked, "Then why are you sitting on the ground? Why don't you
sit ona cushion?" Abu 'Ubaydah said, "Allah is not too shy to speak
the truth, and I will tell you the truth about what you have said. I do
not have any wealth, I own nothing but my horse, my weapon and my
sword. Yesterday I needed some money and I had nothing, so I
borrowed some money om this brother of mine who had some meaning Muc&. He lent it to me. If I also had a rug or a cushion, I
would not sit on it and exclude my bothers and companions; I would
let my brother sit on it, for he may be better than me before Allah. We
are slaves of Allah. We walk on the earth, we sit on the ground, we
eat on the ground, we lie down on the ground, and that does not lower
us in status before Allah at all. Rather Allah increases our reward
thereby and raises us in status, and thus we show humility before our
Lord. "log

2.2.3. Piety
Many governors were keen to be relieved of the task that had
been entrusted to them. 'Utbah ibn Ghanvh asked 'Umar to let h i

off from the governorship of Ba~ra,but he did not let him off."' AnNu'min ibn Maqran, who was the governor of Kaskar, asked 'Umar
to let him off korn being govemor and let him go for jihad so that he
could seek martyrdom."' Some of the Sahribah refused governor
posts when 'Umar asked them to work as governors. Az-Zubayr ihu
alLCAw2mrefused the governorship of Egypt when 'Umar offered it
to him, saying, "0' Abu ' A b d W , would you like to be the

refused the

governorship of Homs when 'Umar offered it to him after the death
of its governor.113

2.2.4. Respect for previous governors
The governors were distinguished by their respect for the
governors who had preceded them. This may be noted in the majority
of govemors at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. For example,
when Khilid ibn al-Waleed came to Syria as governor over Abu
'Ubaydah ibn
and o t h a , he refused to lead Abu 'Ubaydah
in prayer. When 'Umar dismissed Khilid ibn al-Waleed from his post
as commander of the army in Syria, and appointed Abu 'Ubaydah in
his stead, Abu 'Ubaydah hid this news from W i d and did not tell
h i of that until another letter came from 'Umar. Then Kh%d found
out the news and he rebuked Abu 'Ubaydah for not telling him.l14
Dr. 'Abdul-'Azeez al-'Umari said: "During my research I could not
find any governor who sought to humiliate or criticize those who had

come before him. Rather in most cases they praised them in the first
speech given."115

2.3. Rights of governors
Undoubtedly the governors had various rights, some of which
had to do with the people and some with the caliph, in addition to
rights concerning the bayt al-mil. All of these rights, both intangible
and financial, were primarily aimed at helping governors to fulfil
their duties and serve Islam. The most important of these rights were:

2.3.1. Obedience so long as that did not involve sin
The people's duty to obey leaders and governors is confirmed
in Islam. Allah (g)
says:

40' you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger
Muhammad], and those of you [Muslims] who are in authority.
[And] if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah
and His Messenger, if you believe in AUah and in the Last Day. That
is better and more suitable for h a l determinati0n.b (Qurhn 4: 59)
This verse states that it is obligatory to obey those in authority, which
includes the governors who are implementing the commands of
Undoubtedly obedience to
Allah, may He be glorified and e~alted."~
leaders and caliphs is limited to matters of obedience towards Allah,
if they commit sin, there is no duty to obey them.lI7

2.3.2. Giving advice to governors
A man came to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb and said to him: "0'
Ameer al-Mu'miizeen, is it better for me to speak the truth without
fearing anyone except Allah, or should I just focus on myself?" He
said, "One who has been appointed over any of the affairs of the
believers should not fear anyone except Allah, but one who has not
been given any such appointment should focus on himself and be
sincere towards his leader.""'

2.3.3. Conveying news to governors
The people are obliged to bring correct news to their governors
and to be truthful in doing so as much as possible, whether it has to
do with the general public or it is news of the enemy, or it has to do
with the agents and employees of the governor, especially when that
has to do with matters of war and news of the enemy, or with
treacherous acts etc., on the basis of helping the governor to look
after the interests of the ~mmah."~

2.3.4. Supporting the governor in his decisions
If his decisions support the public interest and he mostly needs
the support of the caliph, then the caliph should support him. 'Umar
(4)was very enthusiastic about this principle, because he
understood the importance of people showing respect to their
governors. Even though 'Umar was strict with his governors, if he
found out that there was some transgression against one of them, he
would deal harshly with the aggressors, so that the governors would

'Umar ibn al-Khagrib

61

continue to be respected and would remain able to control the people,
both the common folk and the elite.lZ0

2.3.5. The governor's right to engage in ijtihad
It is the governor's right work out an answer in matters
where there is room for ijtihad, especially in cases where Islam has
not given a precise detinition or in other mattem where there are no
instnrctions or guidelines from the caliph. One of 'Umar's governors
in Syria worked out a system of distributing booty among the cavalry
and infantry, and 'Umar allowed his ijtihad. It is well known that
when Ibn Mas'ood was one of 'Umar's governors, he disagreed with
'Umar in more than one hundred matters of ijtihad.lZi

2.3.6. Respecting them after their dismissal
One of the rights of the governors was that they were to be
respected after having been dismissed. When 'Umar dismissed
S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah from his post as governor of Jordan, he told
the people the reason for his dismissal and when S h d b e e l asked
him, "Did you dismiss me because you are displeased with me, 0'
Ameer al-Mu 'mineen?" he said, 'Wo, I think well of you, but I want a
He dismissed Sa'd ibn Abi
man who is more capable than
Waqqti~(&) from his post as governor of Koofah and perhaps be
thought that in order to protect his dignity he should keep him away
from people who used to criticize him with regard to his prayer, even
though Sa'd most closely imitated the prayer of the Messenger of
Allah &)., because of his knowledge of how the Prophet @) prayed.

So 'Umar dismissed him out of respect for him, so as to protect him
from exposed to the ignorant.lZ3

2.3.7. Their material rights
The governors also had rights with regard to material matters,
chief of which was the salaries on which they lived. Undoubtedly the
S a h i b a h (may Allah be pleased with them), led by the RightlyGuided Caliphs, understood the importance of providing agents with
an income, and acknowledged this as one of their rights, in addition
to it being a means of making them independent of people, and thus
not subject to their influence or attempts to bribe them.Iz4'Umar ibn
al-Khagb was keen for his agents to be honest and to have no desire
for people's wealth, so he made them independent of means. 'Umar
ibn al-Khagh was aware that this is a serious matter and that in order
to guarantee the honesty of his agents, it was essential to make them
independent so that they would feel no need for people's wealth.
There was a discussion between him and Abu 'Ubaydah, in which
Abu 'Ubaydah said to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb: 'You have made the
Indulge in worldly
Companions of the Messenger of AUah
matters" - i.e., by using them as governors. 'Umar said, "0' Abu
'Ubaydah, If I do not seek the help of the pious in fulfilbmg my duties
towards Allah, then whose help should I seek?" Abu 'Ubaydah said,
"If you must do that, then make them independent of means so that
they will not bebay you "Iz5 -i.e., if you appoint them to any post,
then be generous in giving them salaries, so that they will have no
need to he dishonest and will have no need of people.

'Umar gave to the commanders of armies and towns, and to all
his agents, salaries that were reasonably sufficient, in return for their
work (as much as they needed for their food and to take care of other
issues).'26 He was keen that they should be honest concerning the
public wealth that was under their control and he said to his agents:
"As far as this wealth is concerned, I regard you and myself as being
like one who is entrusted with the wealth of an orphan:

%...And whoever [amongst guardians] is rich, he should take no
wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and
(Qur'an 4: 6)."Iz7
reasonable [according to his labour]...)
'Umar gave nearly all his agents a fixed salary, whether it was
daily, monthly or annual. Some of these salaries are mentioned in the
historical sources; in some cases the salary was given in the f o m of
food, in other cases it was a set amount of money.lZ8
It is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib (&) employed
'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood in charge of the judiciary and the bayt al-mil,
' U t h i n ibn Haneef in charge of what was irrigated by the Euphrates
and 'Ammi% ibn Yasir in charge of prayer and the troops. He gave
them a sheep each day, giving half of it and its organs and feet to
'Ann& ibn Y%ir, because he was in charge of prayers and the
troops; and he gave one quarter of it to 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood and
the other quarter to 'Uthmiin ibn Haneef.

because of his asceticism he used to eat from what he earned by his
own hands by making mats of palm-leaves, and he would give his
salary in charity.130
There are various other reports about the salaries that 'Umar
gave to his governors; undoubtedly the variations mentioned in these
reports stem from ongoing developments and changes during
'Umar's caliphate; it does not make sense to think that salaries would
remain the same from the beginning to the end of his reign, since
circumstances changed, prices varied and needs altered as the result
of the spread of conquests and the increased income to the bayt alrnr~1.'~'It is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib gave Mu'gwiyah a
salary of ten thousand dincirs per year for his work as governor of
Syria, and 'Umar gave the leaders of armies and towns salaries that
ranged between seven and nine thousand, according to what they
needed of food and other things.'3z
Some agents did not want to take these salaries in return for
their work as governors for the Muslims, but 'Umar made them
accept them. 'Umar said to one of his governors: "Did I not tell you to
and now when you are

right." 'Umar said, "Why is that?" He said, "I have horses and slaves
and I am well off. I want my work to be an act of charity for the
Muslims." 'Umar said, "Do not do that. I wanted to do the same
thing that you want. The Messenger of Allah &J would give me a
payment and I would say, 'Give it to one who has more need of it
than me.' But the Prophet
said, (<'Takeit and keep it, and give

2.3.8. Treating agents and governors if they fell sick
Mu'ayqeeb, who was 'Umar's keeper of the bayt al-m81, fell
sick, and 'Umar asked for a remedy for him from everyone who had
any medical knowledge. Then two men came from Yemen and he
asked: "Do you have any remedy that yon can offer this righteous
man, for his pain is getting worse?" They said, 'We cannot take away
his illness, but we can give him some treatment that will stop it from
getting any worse." 'Umar said, "It will be a blessing if it stops it
from getting any worse." They said, "Does colocynth (bitter-apple)
grow in your land?" He said, "Yes." They said, "Gather some of it
for us." 'Umar issued orders and two large basketfuls were gathered
for him. They went and cut each colocynth in two, then they made
Mu'ayqeeb lie down. Each of them took one of his feet and started
rnbbing the bottom of the foot with the colocynth, when it wore out
they picked up another and carried on. Then they let him go. 'Umar
said, "His pain will not get worse." The narrator said: "By Allah,
after that Mu'ayqeeb was h e and his pain did not get any worse,
until he died."135

2.4. Duties of governors
Because of the position in which Allah had put them, and the
heavy burden that was placed on their shoulders, 'Umar took care to
remind them of the following duties:

2.4.1. Establishing religious affairs
Such as spreading Islam among the people, establishing
regular prayer, protecting Islam and its fundamentals, building
mosques, organizing the Hajj, and carrying out hadd punishments.

Spreading Islam
This period was a time of great conquests, which meant that
governors had to strive to spread Islam in the conquered lands, with
the help of the Sahribah who were with them.136At the time of
'Umar, Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyk, who was a governor in Syria, wrote
to him saying: "The people of Syria are many in number and have
filled the cities; they need someone to teach them the Qur'an and
Islam; help me with men who can teach them." So 'Umar sent five of
thefiqaha' of the Sahribah to him.'37 'Umar was well known for
frequently saying, "By Allah, I do not send my govemors to you to
beat you and take your wealth, rather I send them to you to teach you
'Umar used to say
your religion and the Sunnah of your~rophet."138
to his govemors: "We have not appointed you to shave the hair of the
Muslims and to beat them; rather we have appointed you to establish

Establishing regular prayer

(4)

'Umar ibn al-Khat&ib
would write to his governors: "The
most important of your affairs in my view is prayer; whoever prays
regularly has protected his faith, but whoever neglects it is bound to
be more negligent in other issues of faith."'40
'Umar also emphasized to his governors the importance of
establishing regular prayer among the people, as he said: "We have
appointed you to establish regular prayer and teach them knowledge

would state in his letters of appointment
and the ~ u r ' a n . " ' ~'Umar
that So and so was in charge of the prayer and the troops, as in the
document in which he appointed 'Ammk ibn %sir in charge of the
prayer and the troops, and 'Abdull& ibn Mas'ood in charge of the
judiciary and the bayt al-mril.142 The jiqaha' who wrote about
Islamic politics spoke of the importance of prayer with regard to the
ruler, and how that had great significance in this world and in the

erea after.'^^
Protecting Islam and its findarnentals
'Umar was keen to protect Islam and its sound bases, which

Building mosques

j

Some statistics state that 4000 mosques were built during
'Umar's caliphate in the Arab regions alone. The governors were
well known for building mosques in the areas that they governed,
such as 'Iyid ibn Ghanrun, who founded a number of mosques in
various parts of Arabia.147

Organizing the Hajj
At the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, the governors were
responsible for organizing the pilgrim' affairs and ensuring the
safety of those who were going for Hajj kom their provinces. The
governors appointed leaders for the Hajj caravans and stipulated the
times of travel so that the pilgrims would not leave except with the
governor's permission. The fuqaha' subsequently stipulated that
organizing the pilgrims was one of the tasks of the governor.148

Carrying out hadd punishments
'Amr ibn al-'As carried out the hadd punishment on one of the
sons of 'Umar ibn al-Khagib in Egypt, then 'Umar himself punished
him, and it was said that he died &om the effects of that whipping.149

The govemors camed out gi& executions without the permission of
the caliph, until 'Umar wrote to them telling them: "Do not kill
anyone without my permission."150 So they began to ask 'Umar for
permission to carry out executions before doing so. Carrying out
hadd punishments is both a religious and a worldly matter that was
taken as seriously by the caliphs and their govemors as other rituals
of slam.'^'

2.4.2. Ensuring the people's
security in their own lands
Maintainlug security in the province was one of the most
important duties of the governor. In order to achieve that, he would
do a number of things, the most important of which was carrying out
hadd punishments on sinners and evildoers in the case of crimes
which threatened people's lives and property.152 In a letter which
'Umar
sent to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari he said: "Make the
evildoers scared...9 , 1 5 3

Carrying out the duty ofjihad against the enemy also played a
major role in ensuring the security of the Islamic lands.154

of Abu Bakr's caliphate until the caliphate of 'Umar we will see that
they played a major role in the conquests; indeed they were sent as

commanders to the lands that had not yet been conquered, and they
conquered them and then set about organizing their affairs -such as
the govemors of Syria, Abu 'Ubaydah, 'Amr ibn al-'As, Yazeed ibn

such as a l - M u h a ibn Hirithah, Khiilid ibn al-Waleed, ' I y g ibn

At the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, as well as being
administrators, the govemors were also Mujihideen who faced the
enemy; that did not distract them from doing the duties that had been
assigned to them. The historical sources speak of the deeds of the
govemors in support of the jihad movement, the most important of
which were:

03 Sending volunteers for jihad
+3 Defending the province against the enemy: 'Umar said, "Your
right over me is that I should protect your borders."
Fortifying cities: 'Umar issued orders that fortresses should be
built for the tribes who went to settle in Giza, in Egypt, fearing
that surprise attacks might be launched against them.lS6
+:*

Seeking out news of the enemy: It is well known that Abu
'Ubaydah used to seek out precise information on Byzantine
gatherings in Syria, and he would stage some tactical
withdrawals on the basis of this information.'57
Supplying horses to the regions: 'Umar implemented a policy
throughout the state of supplying horses that were needed for
jihad throughout the Muslim regions, according to need. He
allocated some land to the people of Bqra for the breeding and

training of horses.lS8 'Umar also gave some land to some of
the Muslims in Damascus for the care of horses, but they
cultivated it instead, so he took it away from them and
imposed a fme on them, for going against the purpose for
which the land had been given to them, which was to breed
horses. 'Umar had four thousand horses in Koofah, which
were looked after by S a w ibn Rabee'ah al-Bihili and some
of the people of Koofah, who trained them and took care of
them. There was a similar set-up in Bqra and in alI the eight
regions.lS9These horses were prepared to go to the immediate
defence of the Islamic state when needed.16'
Teaching children and preparing them for jihad: 'Umar wrote to
the people of the regions, commanding them to teach their
children horsemanship, swimming and archery. A boy was
struck by an arrow during training in Syria and died. They
wrote to 'Umar to tell him about that, but that did not deter him
kom his command to teach the children archery.161
*: Checking on records of the troops: 'Umarpaid special attention to
the records of the troops, based on his belief that the -people
- of
the regions were most in need of such records, especially in the
regions that were close to the enemy, for those were the
regions that needed troops on an ongoing basis.16'

The governors were directly responsible for the military
records, despite the fact that there were some other officials who took
care of that matter. But because the governors were also commanders

of the troops, they were responsible for the military records in their
lands, as deputies of the caliph.163
*:* Implementing treaties: Some treaties were drawn up between Abu
'Ubaydah ibn al- jar&^ and some of the cities of Syria; the
same was also true of governors in Iraq, such as Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqqis, Ahu Moosa al-Ash'ari and others. In addition to that,
the governors were also keen to protect the individual and
communal rights of the dhimmis and to implement the treaties,
in accordance with the commands of ~ h a r i ' a h . ' ~'Umar
~
enjoined proper care of ahl adh-dhimmah and said: "I urge you
to take care of those who are under the protection of AUah and
His Messenger @), and to protect them &om their enemies,
and not to burden them with more than they can bear."'65

2.4.4. Striving hard to ensure that
people receive their stipends
'Umar said: "If I live, I would not leave the widows of Iraq in
need of anyone after me." We should not forget the attitude of 'Umar
during the year of ar-Ramidah, when famine was widespread. 'Umar
mobilized all the resources of the state to resolve the crisis and feed
the hungry. Al-Bayhaqi narrated in his Sunan that 'Umar spent on the
people affected by the famine of ar-Ramgdah, until rain fell and they
started moving on kom Madeenah. 'Umar went out to them, riding a
horse, and watched as they were moving on, with tears flowing down
his cheeks. A man from Banu M@rih ibn m f a h said: "I bear
witness that you are relieved, and you are not the son of slave
woman" - praising 'Umar. 'Umar said to him, "Woe to you! I

would accept this praise if I had spent my own wealth or the wealth of
al-KhaMh, but I spent the wealth of Allah."'66 And 'Umar said,
"Your right over me is that I will not collect anything of your taxes
and I will not take any of the booty way ') that Allah has bestowed
upon you, except in a proper manner. Your right over me is that if I
collect something, I will not spend it except in the proper manner.
Your right over me is that I will increase your stipends and provision,
if Allah wills."'67
The distribution of stipends at the time of 'Umar was done
regularly, in an organized manner. They were not given only to the
inhabitants of the cities, rather the tribes in the desert were also given
stipends. 'Umar ibn al-Khasb used to go around to the tribes who
lived near Madeenah and distribute their stipends to them himself,
and he wrote to some of his governors telling them to give the people
their stipends and provision. 'Umar wrote saying that this was their
booty that Allah had bestowed upon them; it did not belong to 'Umar
or to the family of 'Umar, so divide it among the people.'68
'Umar did not stop at making sure that people got their share,
rather he also strove to ensure that people had enough food. During
one of his visits to Syria, Bil2 ibn Rab* came to him and said: "0'
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, by Allah, the commanders of your army in
Syria do not eat anything but the flesh of fowls and h e bread, but the
common folk of the Muslim do not eat such things." 'Umar asked
them, "Is what Bilil is saying true?" Yazeed ibn Ah1 Sufiyk said to
him, "0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,the prices in our country are low and
we can buy that which Bilil mentioned here for what it costs to feed
our families in the Hijiz." 'Umar (&) said, "By Allah, I will not

leave until you guarantee for me the provision of the Muslims each
month." Then he said, "See how much is sufficient for a man to get
the food he likes." They said, "Two measures of wheat and enough
olive oil and vinegar to go with it, at the beginning of each month."
So they guaranteed that to him, then he said, "0' Muslims, this is in
addition to your stipends. If your agents fulfil what I have allocated to
you, and they give it to you every month, that is what I want. But if
they do not do that, then tell me, so that I can dismiss them and
appoint others in their stead."'69
'Umar was also keen to distribute food throughout the regions,
check on the markets and prevent hoarding, and his governors also
checked on the markets. He also commanded merchants to travel and
bring what the Muslims needed and make it available in their
markets.'70 'Umar and his governors did not stop at securing the food
supply and checking on the markets only, rather the issue of
accommodation and the distribution thereof was another task that
was entrusted to the govemors of towns and cities. When the new
cities (amscir) were founded and laid out, he distributed land to the
people to live in, in Koofah and ~ a s r a ' ~and
' in al-Fusgt. The
governors also supervised the division of houses in conquered cities
such as Horns, Damascus, Alexandria, etc.'"

2.4.5. Appointment of agents and employees
The appointment of agents and employees was another task
that was allocated to the govemors in many cases. A province usually
consisted of a major city and other cities and regions that belonged to

the province. It needed its affairs to be organized, so the governors
appointed agents and employees to represent them in those areas,
whether they were local leaders or collectors of taxes (kharij). These
appointments were usually made by agreement between the caliph
and the governor.'73

2.4.6. Taking care of akl a d k - d k i m d
Taking care of ah1 adh-dhimmah, respecting treaties with
them, fulfilling their rights as granted by shari'ah, asking them to do
their duties towards the Muslims, checking on their situation,
restoring their rights in accordance with shari'ah when they had been
wronged, were all duties of the governor. The caliphs set specific
conditions for ahl adh-dhimmah in most cases before entering into
treaties with them, then they gnaranteed their rights and asked them
to adhere to those condition^.'^^

2.4.7. Consulting people of wisdom in the
province and honouring prominent people
'Urnar emphasized the importance of consulting wise people
in their lands. The governors implemented this principle and held
gatherings where they would consult the people. He commanded his
governors to continually consult the people of wisdom'75, and he
asked them to honour people in accordance with their status. 'Umar
wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari saying: "I have heard that you allow
all kinds of people to come to you. When this letter of mine reaches
you, allow the noble people and people of the Qur'an, piety and

religious commitment to come in first. When they have taken their
sets, then allow the common folk to come in." He also wrote to him
saying: "People refer their matters to the prominent people, so
honour the prominent people, for it is enough for the weak Muslim to
be treated fairly with regard to judgement and division of wealth."176

2.4.8. Looking at the developmental

needs of the province
During his governorship, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi~dug a channel
in response to a request from some of the Persian leaders in the
interests of the farmers in the area.177'Umar ibn al-Khagb wrote to
Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari commanding him to dig a channel for the
people of Basra, and Abu Moosa dug a channel four parasangs long
to bring water to the inhabitants of ~ ~ r aWhen
. ' ~founding
~
the
famous cities of Koofah, Bqra and al-Fusct 'Umar's governors also
paid attention to laying out streets, distributing land, building
mosques, securing water sources and other public interests of these
cities. They also encouraged people to settle in areas that were less
desirable because of their proximity to the enemy or for other
reasons. They offered them incenhves and land grants to encourage
them to remain there. 'Umar and 'Uthmin did that in Antioch
(Antakiya) and in some parts of Mesopotamia.

2.4.9. Paying attention to the social affairs
of the inhabitants of the provinces
When delegations came to 'Umar (&), he would ask them
about their governor and they would say good things. He would ask

them, Does he visit the sick? And they would say yes. He would ask
them, Does he visit slaves when they are sick? And they would say
yes. He would ask, How does he treat the weak? Do they sit at his
door (waiting to be admitted)? If they said no to any of these
questions, he would dismiss that governor.179'Umar would dismiss a
governor if he heard that he did not visit the sick and did not admit
the weak.lsO 'Urnar ibn al-Khaeb was also keen for his agents to
appear humble before the people, so that the people would feel that
the governor was one of them and was not different t?om them.
'Umar stipulated that his governors should ride mounts and wear
clothes of the same standard as the people, and he forbade them to
have doorkeepers and gatekeepers.181

2.4.10. Not discriminating between
Arabs and non-Arabs
The governors were obliged to treat people equally and not to
differentiate between Arabs and other Muslims. Some people came
to a governor of 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b and he gave to the Arabs and
not to the non-Arabs. 'Umar wrote to him saying: "It is sufficient evil
for a man to despise his Muslim brother." According to another
report, he wrote to him saying: "Why did you not treat them
equally?"'s2
There are a number of other moral duties which are enjoined
by Islam, such as fuktilling covenants, being sincere in one's work,
remembering that Allah is always watching in everything that one

does, being prepared to cooperate with others in all good and
righteous deeds, and the obligation to be sincere towards Allah, His
Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk, for
this is in the interests of all.'83 In addition to adhering to these
obligations, the governor was also reqwed to propagate them among
the people m his province, through his khutbahs, writing, preaching
and dealings. The governors at the time of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphs -in general -were fine examples of these moral attitudes
and duties, both in personal matters and in the way in which they
interacted with the people.'84

2.5. Translation in the provinces and
the working hours of the governors
2.5.1. Translation in the provinces
Translation was regarded as a means of helping the governors
at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliph, and there was a real need
for it in many cases. 'Umar asked his governors in Iraq to send to
Madeenah some of the Persian chieftains so that he could discuss the
kharij with them. They sent him some chieftains and a translator
along with them.Is5 It is reported that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah
knew a little of the Persian language, and he translated for 'Umai and

'Umar ibn al-Khaffdb

79

Knowledge of translation is something that was well known in
the Islamic state, at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and
before that. If we remember that the khardj records were not written
in Arabic, then we will realize the extent of the need for translators in
the provinces who could translate in cases of khariij and other
matters. The agents in charge of the khariij were mostly Persians or
non-Arabs. The spread of newcomers to the faith in the various
Islamic regions also made the need for translation a top priority in
judicial and other matters, as did the need for negotiations between
the leaders of the conquests, who were mostly governors, and the
peoples of the conquered lands.'s7

2.5.2. Working hours of the governors
There was no precise defimtxon of the working hours at the
time of 'Umar. The caliph and his governors worked at all hours, and
they did not have doorkeepers. Some of them used to patrol at night,
and their example in that regard was 'Umar ibn al-Khagb himself,
who was famous for walking about at night on his patrols of
Madeenah. The people would meet the governor at various times,
asking him to deal with their affam, and they did not find anyone
who would prevent them fiom entering to meet the governor on the
grounds that this was not the time for work. The governors were well
known for their eagerness to finish tasks straight away, with no delay.
'Umar ibn al-Khagb wrote concerning this to Abu Moosa alAsh'ari, saying: "Do not put off today's work until tomorrow, lest
work accnmulate and you achieve nothing."'s8

3. 'Umar's Checking on his Governors
3.1. Checking on governors
'Umar did not stop at selecting the best men to work as his
agents and governors, rather he strove hard to follow up on them and
check on them after appointing them, to be sure that they were doing
well, and for fear that they might deviate or drift away. His slogan
was: "It is better for me to dismiss one governor every day than to
leave a wrongdoer in place for even one min~te.""~And he said:
"Any governor of mine who wrongs anyone and I hear of his
wrongdoing, if1 do not change him, then I have wronged him."190
One day he said to those who were around him: "What do you think,
if I were to appoint over you the best one I could finti then command
him to be just, would I have done what is required of me?" They said,
"Yes." He said, "NO,not until I see how he does, and whether he will
do what I have commanded him or not."19'
'Umar was very strict in checking on his governors and agents.
His method of administration was to give his governors ffee rein in
local affairs, to limit them with regard to public affairs, and then to
watch and see how they dealt with things. He had a secret service
which watched the governors and the people. The historical sources
tell us that something like the modem-day intelligence services
existed at the time of 'Umar and that he knew as much about those
agents who were far away kom him as those who slept with him in
the same room. There was no region or area in which there was a

governor or m y commander, but there were eyes constantly
watching him, and the words uttered in the east and the west reached
'Umar every moming and evening. You can see that in the letters that
he wrote to his governors and agents, and some agents would accuse
the closest people to them of spying for mar.'^^ 'Umar had
numerous means of checking on his governors, which included the
following:

3.1.1. Asking the governors to enter Madeenah by day
'Umar asked his governors, when they came to Madeenah, to
enter the city by day, and not at night, so that the wealth and booty
that they brought could be seen and so that it would be easy to ask
them questions and bring them to account.193

3.1.2. Asking the governors to send delegations
'Umar asked the governors to send delegations from the local
people so that he could ask them about their lands and the kharcij that
had been imposed on them, so as to ensure that they were not being
wronged, and he asked them to give their testimony concerning the
situation in their lands. The khardj of Koofah was brought to him by
ten of its people, and the kharcij of Basra was brought by a similar
number. When they appeared before him, they testified by Allah that
it was good (halcil) wealth, and that no Muslim or mu 'cihad had been
wronged with regard to it.194This was sufficient to prevent govemors
from wronging the people. If that had happened, the delegates would
have complained to 'Umar and told him about it. 'Urnar usually held

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn ul-Khottrib

discussions with the delegates and asked them about their lands and
about the governors and how they treated them."'

3.1.3.Mail service
'Umar sent mail to the governors in the various regions, and
when the mail carrier wanted to return to Madeenah, he would issue
orders that the call be given to the people, asking whether anyone
wanted to send a letter to the caliph, so that he could cany it back to
him without any interference fiom the local governor. The mail
carrier himself did not know anything about the letters or their
contents, thus the people had free rein to send complaints of
wrongdoing to 'Umar himself without the governor or his men
knowing anything about it. When the mail carrier reached 'Umar, he
would give the letters he had to 'Umar, and 'Umar would read them
and see what they said.196

3.1.4. The general inspector
(Muhammad ibn Maslamah)
Muhammad ibn Maslamah al-An& was appointed by 'Umar
to check on the governors and to examine any complaints that were
made against them. The role of Muhammad ibn Maslamah was that
of a general inspector in the caliphate. He checked on how the
govemors were doing their job and brought to account those who
were falling short. 'Umar sent him to check on the senior
governors'97, investigate complaints, to meet the people and listen to
them, and to transmit their opinions of their governors directly to
'Umar. Muhammad ibn Maslamah also had some helpers.

'Umar ibn al-Khagdb

83

3.1.5.The Hajj season
The Hajj season provided 'Umar with an opporhmity to
receive news about the people and the governors. He made it a season
for reflecting, checking and seeking opinions from all regions, where
those with complaints about wrongdoing would gather, and the
"watchers" whom 'Umar had sent to all regions of his state to check
on his agents and governors would report back to him. The agents
themselves would also come to give an account of their actions. The
season of Hajj was like a "general assembly" that was as refined as
any general assembly in any era.198During the Hajj season, 'Umar
would give a summary of the governors' duties to the people, then he
said: "Whoever has been treated differently than that, let him stand
up." No one of the people present stood up, on that occasion, except
one man, which is indicative of the justice of those governors and
how pleased the people were with them. That man said, "Your
governor So and so gave me one hundred lashes." 'Umar asked the
governor and did not receive any satisfactory answer, so he said to
the man, "Get up and retaliate (qi&)." 'Amr ibn al-'& stood up and
said, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, if you do that it will happen a lot and
it will become something regular after you are gone." 'Umar said,
"How can I not settle scores when I saw the Messenger of Allah @g)
allowing others to settle scores with him?" 'Amr said, "Let us make a
deal with him." He said, "Here he is, make a deal with him." So the
agent gave him two hundred dinrirs, two dinrirs for each blow with
the whip.199

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn ol-Khatfrib

3.1.6. Regular inspections of the regions
Before he was killed, 'Umar was thinking of travelling around
the provinces himself, to check on the govemors and see the situation
of the people and make sure that the affairs of his vast state were in
order. 'Umar said: "If I live, insha' Allih, I will travel among the
people for one year, for I know that the people have needs that I do
not hear about. Their agents do not tell me about them and they
cannot reach me. So I will go to Syria and stay there for two months,
then I will go to Mesopotamia and stay there for two months, then I
will go to Koofah and stay there for two months, then I will go to
Basra and stay there for two months, and by Allah, what a good year
it will be."z00

'Umar managed to carry out some of his plan, particularly in
Syria, as he went there several times and checked on the situation and
enteredthe houses of the govemors and agentszo1to check closely on
them. He entered the house of Abu 'Ubaydah and saw how simply he
lived, and there took place a discussion between 'Umar and the wife
of Abu 'Ubaydah, in which she blamed 'Umar for the simple and
ascetic life they were living. He also visited the house of Kh2lid ibn
al-Waleed, where he found that he had nothing that would attract
attention except his weapons which he was busy repairing.
When visiting these people, he would make surprise visits. He
took with him a man who would knock at the door of the governor
and ask for permission for himself and the one who was with him to
enter, without telling them that it was 'Umar. When 'Umar entered
the house, he would examine it and check on its furnishings.z0z

85

'Umar heard that Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyin ate a variety of
foods, so he waited until it was the dinner hour, then he asked
permission to enter and meet Yazeed. When he saw his food, he told
him not to be extravagant with regard to food.Z03'Umar did not stop
at checking on them by means of these visits, rather he used another
method, which was sending some wealth to these govemors and
sending people to watch them and see how they disposed of it. He
sent five hundred dinars to Abu 'Ubaydah, and Abu 'Ubaydah
distributed the entire amount. His wife used to say: "By Allah, the
arrival of dinars did us more harm than good." Abu 'Ubaydah went
to a worn-out garment on which we used to pray and cut it into
pieces, then he wrapped some of those dinars in each piece and sent it
to the poor, until it was all gone.204
'Umar did the same thing with other governors during that
visit to Syria. He did not only check on his govemors during his
joumey, rather he would also bring them to Madeenah and appoint
someone to watch what they ate and drank, and what they wore, and
he would also do that himself.205

3.1.7. The archive or records of the caliphate
'Umar was extremely keen to preserve the documents
pertaining to the governors and to the caliphate in general. He was
most concerned with preserving the treaties that the governors had
drawn up with the peoples of the conquered lands, lest anyone be
wronged. It is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b had a box or chest
in which he kept every treaty that had been drawn up between him
and others. We may call this chest the "archive" or records of the

caliphate. The governors also had chests in which they kept their
papers and documents, to refer to them when necessary and so that
there would not be any confusion about any matter.'06

3.2. Complaints from the people
about the governors
'Umar (&) would investigate complaints kom the people
about the governors himself. He was keen to check matters and he
would consult the wise and knowledgeable people around him, then
issue his commands to reward or punish those who desenred it,
whether they were agents or common folk.'07 There follow some
examples of complaints against governors and how 'Umar (&) dealt
with them.

3.2.1. The complaint of the people of Koofah
against Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqss (4)
Some of the people of Koofah, led by al-Jarr* ibn Sin& alAsadi got together and complained to 'Umar about their governor
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis (&). That happened at a time when the
Magians were gathering in Nahawand to attack the Muslims, but this
group was not deterred by what was facing the Muslims. Sa'd was
just and compassionate towards the people; he was strong and
determined against the people of falsehood and the troublemakers,
and kind towards the people
. . of truth and obedience. But despite that
these people, who could not bear the rule of truth, started to stir up
trouble and they wanted to achieve some of their whims and desires.

They chose a time to make their complaint when they thought that
'Umar would have no choice but to listen to them, because the
Muslims were preparing for a decisive battle which required that
there be unity among the Muslims. They knew how deeply
concerned 'Umar was for the Muslims to be united at all times,
especially in such circumstances, so they hoped they would achieve
what they wanted. The caliph responded to their request and
investigated their complaint, even though he knew that they were evil
people who followed their whims and desires. He did not hide what
he thought of them; rather he told them bluntly and explained to them
that the fact that he thought they were wronging their governor and
making false accusations against him would not stop him eom
investigating the matter. He proved to them why he thought that their
intentions were bad when he said: "The fact that your mtentions are
bad is proven by your choice of time, when your enemy is mobilizing
its forces. By Allah, that will not stop me kom investigating your
case, even if the enemy attacks
'Umar sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah, at the time when the
people were preparing to do battle with the Persians and the Persians
were preparing to attack the Muslims. Muhammad ibn Maslamah
was the one who was appointed to investigate complaints made
against agents and governors at the time of 'Umar. Muhammad came
to Sa'd and went around Koofah with him, whilst the Muslims were
mobilizing to head for Nahawand. Sa'd took him around to the
mosques of Koofah, and he did not ask anyone about him secretly, for
it was not their habit to conduct investigations in secret at that
time.209 This shows us the method used by the Sahibah in
investigating disputes that arose between people in charge and those
who were under them. The investigation was conducted openly, in
' 0 8 Tbeekh at-Tobari, 51103
' 0 9 Ibid.

the presence of the person in charge and those for whom he was
responsible. He did not stop at any mosque and ask the people about
Sa'd but they said, "We know nothing- but good about him and we do
not want anyone else (as governor). We will not say anything against
him and we will not help anyone against him," except those who
were on the side of al-.Tar& ibn S i n k and his companions; they kept
quiet and did not say anything bad, because they had no justification
for doing so, but they deliberately did not praise him. Then they came
to Banu 'Abs. Muhammad said: 'I adjure by Allah any man who
knows the truth to speak it." U s h a h ibn QatkIah said, "By Allah, if
you adjure us, I would say that he does not divide equally, and he is
not just towards the people, and he does not lead us in war." Sa'd
said, "By Allah, if he says that he is lying and showing off. May his
sight be taken away, may the number of his dependents increase, and
may he he exposed to temptation." He went blind, he was given ten
daughters, and whenever he heard of any woman he would go to her
and pursue her. When he was caught, he said, "The prayer of Sa'd,
the blessed man." Then Sa'd began to pray against them, saymg: "0'
Allah, if they are rebelling out of arrogance and falsely, then strike
them with Your calamities." Then they were struck with calamities.
A l - J d was killed with the sword on the day when they rebelled
against al-Hasan ibn 'Ali and tried to assassinate him in Sab2t.
Qabeesah was struck with rocks and died. Arbad was killed by a
blow with a sword handle. This report gives us examples of how
Allah supports His pious fiends, as He answered the prayer of Sa'd
against those who had wronged him and they were all stricken as the
result of his du'ri' against them. It also shows us how Allah's
response to the du '6' of Sa'd and others like him is a kind of divine
care for the pious close fiends of AUah. The fact that these people
against whom Sa'd prayed met with a bad end indicates that evil was
firmly established in their souls, which led them to that bad end. Sa'd
defended himself and said: "I was the fmt man to shed blood among

the mushrikeen, and the Messenger of Allah &)
- mentioned both of
his parents when he spoke of me, and he had not done so for anyone
before me - that was when he said to him on the day of m u d :
(<'Shoot, may my father and mother be sacrificed for yon!')) - I
remember when I was one of only five in Islam, and Banu Asad are
claiming that I do not pray properly or that the hunt has distmcted
me." Muhammad ibn Maslamah went with him and with them to
'Umar and when they came to hnn, he told them the story. 'Umar
turned to Sa'd and asked: "0' Sa'd, woe to you, how do you pray?"
Sa'd said, "I make the first two rak'ahs long and the last two rak'ahs
short." 'Umar said, "That is what I thought." Then 'Umar (&) said,
"Were it not for the need for caution, the way to deal with them would
be clear." Then he asked, "Whom do yon appoint as your successor
in Koofah, 0' Sa'd?" He said, " 'Abdulliih ibn 'Abdulliih ibn 'Utbh."
'Umar approved and appointed him as govemor.210
'Umar's words, "Were it not for the need for caution, the way
to deal with them would be clear" mean that they were ignorant
wrongdoers, and it was obvious that Sa'd was innocent of what they
attributed to him, but caution for the sake of the nmmah necessitated
warding offfitnah and nipping it in the bud, before it got any worse
and led to trouble, division and maybe fighting. If the accused person
was innocent of what was attributed to him then nothing would harm
him once he had been proven innocent of the accusations against
him. They understood governorship as a burden, not an opportunity;
it was a duty for which they hoped for reward kom Allah. Being
appointed in charge of any of the Muslims' affairs is a kind of
righteous deed for the one who fears Allah and seeks His pleasure
and the Hereafter. If this deed becomes a source offitnah, wisdom
dictates that one should not continue in it, as was the case here. This

90

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn ul-Khagkb

is what 'Umar did when he relieved Sa'd of his post and appointed
his deputy who was trusted by Sa'd.'" 'Umar kept Sa'd in Madeenah
and approved of the man whom Sa'd nominated to succeed him in
Koofah. Thus Sa'd became one of 'Umar's consultants in
~adeenah."' Then he nominated him as one of the six candidates for
the caliphate when he was stabbed, and he urged the caliph who
succeeded him to appoint Sa'd as a governor, and said: "I did not
dismiss him for something bad, but I feared that his reputation might
be tarnished because of that."'13

3.2.2. Complaints against 'Amr ibn al-'A+,
the governor of Egypt
'Umar kept a strict watch on 'Amr ibn al-'&, and the caliph
intervened in the affairs of the province on occasion. When 'Amr ibn
al-'As had a minbar made for himself, he wrote to him, saying: "I
have heard that you have acquired a minbar to raise yourself above
the heads of the Muslims. Is it not sufiicient for you that you stand
with the Muslims at your feet? I insist that you should break it."'14
'Amr ibn al-'AS feared 'Umar's checking on him. He knew
how keen 'Umar was that justice should be established among the
people, and that the limits set by shari'ah be adhered to, so he did his
utmost to ensure that no news reached 'Umar but that which would
ibn
please him. An example of that occurred when 'Abdur--2n
'Umar ibn al-Khagb and another man drank something without
realizing that it was an intoxicant, and they became intoxicated. Then
they came to 'Amr ibn al-'& and asked him to carry out the hndd

punishment on them. 'Amr rebuked them and threw them out, and
'Abdur-Ralpnin said to him: "If you do not do it, I wlll tell my
father!" 'Amr said, "I realized that if I did not carry out the hadd
pmshment on them, 'Umar would be angry and would hsmiss me."
Then 'Amr flogged them in front of the people, but he shaved their
heads inside his house, and the usual procedure was to shave the head
at the same h e as flogging, in front of the people. Then he received
a letter from 'Umar, rebuking him for not shaving their heads in front
of the people, in which he said: 'You flogged 'Abdur-Ralph inside
your house and you shaved his head mside your house, although you
knew that this was against my wishes! 'Abdur-R@%n is one of the
men under your authority, and you should treat him as you would
treat any other Muslim. But you said, he is the son of the caliph,
although you know that I do not compromise for anyone with regard
to a duty that is owed to ~ l l a h . " ~ ~ ~
Other complaints were also made against 'Amr ibn al-'&
during his governorship; some of them came from his Muslim troops,
and some came from the Egyptians, which led 'Umar to summon
'Amr ibn al-'AS on several occasions, to rebuke him and sometimes
to punish him for what he had done. An example of that was when
one of the Egyptians complained that a son of 'Amr ibn al-'AS had
struck him with a whip, which led 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b to summon
'Amr and his son. He then commanded the Egyptian to settle the
score with the son of 'Amr ibn al-'AS, and he said to him: "If yon had
hit his father 'Amr, we would not have stopped you." Then 'Umar
turned to 'Amr ibn al-'AS and spoke his famous words: 'When did
you enslave people whose mothers bore them free?"z16
Another incident which comes under this heading was when
one of the soldiers complained about 'Amr ibn al-'AS who had

Al-Wilryah 'ala al-Buldrin, 1181.

92

The Fiqh of 'Urnar ibn al-Khattrib

accused him of hypocrisy. 'Umar sent a letter ordering that 'Amr
should be made to sit before the people and be whipped by this man if
the testimony of witnesses proved that what this soldier said was true.
The soldier's complaint was proven by testimony, that 'Amr had
accused him ofbeing a hypocrite. The people tried to stop the soldier
from hitting 'Amr, and to accept money in compensation instead, but
he refused that. When the man stood by 'Amr to hit him he said, "Is
there anyone who will stop me from hitting you?" 'Amr said, "No,
go ahead with what you have been commanded to do." He said, "I let

3.2.3. Complaints against Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari,
the governor of Basra
It was narrated from Jareer ibn 'Abdulla al-Bajali that a man
who had a loud voice and was very tough with the enemy in battle
was with Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari. They got some booty and Abu
Moosa gave him part of his share, but he insisted on having it all.
Abu Moosa gave hun twenty lashes and shaved his head. The man
gathered up his hair and went to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, and entered to
meet hi.Jareer said: "I was the closest of the people to 'Umar. He
took out his hair and threw it at 'Umar's chest, then he said, "Were it
not for the Hellfire." 'Umar said, "That's right, were it not for the
Hellfire." He said, "0'
Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, I had a loud voice and I
was very tough with the enemy in battle," and he told him his story.
He then said, "Abu Moosa gave me twenty lashes and shaved my
head, and he t h i s that no one can settle the score with him." 'Umar
(&) said, "If all the people were as fum as this man, that would be
dearer to me than all the booty that Allah has granted us. 'Umar wrote
to Abu Moosa saying: "Peace be upon you. So and so has told me

such and such. If you did that before a group of people, then I urge
you to sit before a group of people so that he may settle the score with
you. If you did that with no people around, then I urge you to sit
where there are no people around and let him settle the score with
you." The man came, and the people said to him, "Let him off." He
said, "No, by AUah, I would not let him off for the sake of any man."
When Abu Moosa sat for him to settle the score, the man raised his
head and looked up at the heavens, then he said, "0' Allah, I have let
him oE.,>21S
It was narrated that 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar (4)
said: "We were
with 'Umar on a journey when he saw a man rushing. He said, 'This
man is looking for us.' The man came and wept, and 'Umar wept, and
asked, 'What is the matter with you?' He said, '0' Ameer alMu'mineen, I drank alcohol, and Abu Moosa hit me and blackened
my face and paraded me before the people, and told the people not to
sit with me. I thought of taking my sword and striking Abu Moosa
with it, or of coming to you and asking you to send me to a land
where I am not known, or of going to live in the land of shzrk.' 'Umar
wept and said, 'I would not like you to go and live m the land of
shirk, even if I have such and such in return.' And he said, 'If you are
one of those who drank alcohol, then the people drank alcohol during
the Jihiliyah.' Then 'Umar wrote to Abu Moosa, saying, 'So and so
came to me and told me such and such. When this letter of mine
reaches you, tell the people to sit with him and to mix with him. If he
repents, then accept his testimony.' And he gave him some clothes
and ordered that he be given two hundred dirhams.219According to
another report, he said, 'So and so the son of So and so &om Banu
Tameem has told me such and such. By Allah, if you do that again I
will certainly blacken your face and parade you before the people. If

tell the people to eat with him and sit with him,and S h e repents then

mount, and gave him two hundred
This story shows us
how keen 'Umar was that none of his governors should overstep the
mark in carrying out hadd punishments on sinners."'

3.2.4. The complaints of the people of Homs
against Sa'eed ibn ' h i r
Khilid ibn Ma'din said: 'Umar ibn al-Khagb appointed
al-Jum* over us in Homs. When 'Umar came to
Sa'eed ibn 'h
Homs he said: "0' people of Homs, how do you fmd your
governor?" and they complained about him. The people of Hams
were known as "the little Koofah because of their complaints about
their governors. They said: "We have four complaints about him. He
does not come out to us nntil late in the day." He said, "This is a
serious matter. What else?" They said, "He does not respond to
anyone at night." He said, "This is a serious matter. What else?"
They said, "There is one day in the month when he does not come out
to us." He said, "This is a serious matter. What else?" They said:
"Sometimes he passes out." 'Umar gathered them and him together
and said, "0' Allah, do not prove me wrong in my view of him this
day," then he began to judge the matter. He asked them in front of
him, "What is your complaint against him?" They said, "He does not
come out to us until the late in the day." 'Umar asked, "What do you
say?" Sa'eed said, "By Allah, I did not want to mention it. My family
has no servant, so I make dough and wait for it to rise, then I hake my

bread, then I do wudoo', then come out to them." 'Umar asked,
'What is your complaint against him?" They said, "He does nor
respond to anyone at night." 'Umar asked, "What do you say?"
Sa'eed said, "By Allah, I did not want to mention it. I have set aside
the day for them and the night for Allah." 'Umar then asked, "What
is your complaint against him?" They said, "There is one day in the
month when he does not come out to us. " 'Umar asked, "What do
you say?" Sa'eed said, "I have no servant to wash my garment for me
and I have no garment other than this, so I wait for it to dry,then I put
it on and come out to them at the end of the day." 'Umar asked,
"What is your complaint against him?" They said, "Sometimes he
passes out." 'Umar asked, "What do
say?" Sa'eed said, "1
witnessed the killing of Khubayb a l - h i r i in Makkah when
Quraysh cut his flesh and tied him to a tree trunk and said, 'Would
you like Muhammad to be in your place?' He said, 'By Allah, I
would not like to be with my family and my children and see
Muhammad pricked by a thorn.' Then he called out, '0'
Muhammad!' Whenever I remember that day and how I failed to help
him at that time, when I was a mushrik and did not believe in Allah
the Almighty, I Ithat Allah will never forgive me for that sin.
Then I pass out." 'Umar said, "Praise be to Allah Who has not
proved my instinct wrong." He sent him with a thousand dinars and
said, 'Vse it to help yourself," and he Sa'eed distributed it."'

3.2.5. Dismissal of an agent who
made fun of one of the people
Qays ibn Abi H& (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated:
" 'Umar employed a man of the h

the people of al-Heerah, 'Amr ibn Hayyh ibn Baqeelah. He brought

him food and drink and whatever he wanted, then he (the Ans%i)
started to joke a great deal. He called him and wiped his hand on his
beard. Then 'Amr ibn Hayyk went to 'Umar and said, "0'Ameer alMu'mineen, I served Chosroes and Caesar and I was never
intimidated in the manner in which I was intimidated under your
reign." 'Umar asked, "How is that?" He said, "Your agent stayed
with me and we brought him food and drink and whatever he wanted,
then he started to joke a great deal. He called me and wiped his hand
on my beard. 'Umar sent for him and said, "What is this? He brought
you food and drink and whatever you wanted, then you called him
and wiped your hand on his beard? By Allah, were it not that I do not
want to set a precedent, I would have left a single hair of your beard
without pulling it out. Now go, for by Allah you will never do any
work for me."223

3.3. Punishments that were carried out on
govemors at the time of 'Umar (&)
As a result of 'Umar's watching his govemors, he noticed
some mistakes that the govemors made, so he disciplined and
punished them for these mistakes. His methods of disciplining the
govemors varied according to the situation and what the cahph
thought best. Among the most importa~~t
methods he used were the
following:

3.3.1. Settling scores with govemors when they erred
'Umar used to say: "I have not sent my govemors to beat you
or to take your wealth, rather I have sent them to you to teach you

'Umar ibn al-Khandb

97

your religion and Sunnah. Whoever is treated differently than that, let
him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will
settle the score for him."224 'Umar did not stop at official
announcements which warned the governors against aggression
towards the people, rather he put that into practice, as we have seen
above, when complaints were made against Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari
and 'Amr ibn al-'AS (may Allah be pleased with them

3.3.2. Dismissing a governor as a result of his error
'Umar dismissed governors as a result of their falling into
errors of which he did not approve. He dismissed one of his
governors when he interfered in matters that did not concern h i
with regard to his troops. He was sent to lead an m y , then when he
reached them he said: "I want you to tell me of every sin that you
commit." So they started to confess their sins to him. News of that
reached 'Umar and he said: "What is wrong with him, may he be
doomed, that he goes and uncovers that which Allah had concealed?
By Allah, he will never work for me again."226
'Umar also got
when he heard
- angry
- . with one of his governors
some of his poetry in which he mentioned wine, so he dismissed
him.227

3.3.3.Destroying part of the governors' dwellings
This was done in case where there was some transgression.
'Umar was keen that the governors' houses should be without gates

and gatekeepers. When he heard that Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqB (&) had
put a gate on his house, he sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah to him and
told him to bum that gate.zz8The reason for that gate was that the
market was close to his house, and the loud voices in the market were
disturbing Sat& so he put a gate to block the noise of the people in
the market. News of Sa'd's house and its gate reached 'Umar, and he
heard that people were calling it Sa'd's palace. So he called
Muhammad ibn Maslamah and sent him to Koofah. He said: "Go to
the palace and bum its gate, then come back straight away." So he
went to Koofah, where he bought some firewood, took it to the palace
and burned the gate.z29
Ibn Shibh narrated that 'Umar appointed Mujisha' ibn
Mas'ood in charge of some work, and he heard that his wife kept
buying new furnishings. 'Umar wrote to him and said: "From the
slave of Allah, the Commander of the Faithful, to Mujkha' ibn
Mas'ood. Peace be upon you. I have heard that al-Khu@yra' keeps
buying new furnishings. When this letter of mine reaches you, I urge
you not to put it down until you have tom down her wall hangings."
The letter reached him when there were some people sitting with him.
He looked at the letter, and the people realized that something
upsetting had come to him. He took the letter in his hand then he said
to the people: "Get up!" So they got up, and by Allah they did not
know why he was making them get up. He took them to the door of
his house, then he went in and was met by his wife, who could see
something bad in his expression. She asked him, "What is the matter
with you?" He said, "Go away! I am angry with you." So the woman
went away and he said to the people, "Come in." The people went in
and he said, "Let each one of you take what is nearest to him in this
direction, and tear it down." So they all tore it down and threw it on

'Urnar ibn al-Khatfdb

the ground, and the letter was still in his hand; he had not put it down
yet.
When 'Umar visited Syria, Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyk invited
him to come and eat with him. When 'Umar entered the house, he
saw some wallhangings. 'Umar started to tear them up, saying, "Woe
to you, do you dress walls with material that could be used by people
to shield themselves from the heat and

3.3.4. Disciplining by hitting
'Umar ibn al-KhatJib (&) used this method and was famous
for carrying his stick with which he struck people. He struck some of
the govemors because of some deeds that they committed. During
'Umar's visit to Syria, he entered the house of one of his governors
and found that they had too many possessions. 'Umar got angry and
started hitting them with his
Also during 'Umar's visit to
Syria, some of the governors came to meet him. The fmt ones who
met him were Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyh and Abu 'Ubaydah, then
Kh%lid, who came riding horses and wearing fine garments, that did
not befit the Mujihideen. 'Umar dismounted, picked up some stones
and started throwing them at them, and said, "How quickly you have
changed your ways! Are you receiving me in this manner? It is only
two years ago that you started having your fill. By Allah even if you
were to do this after two hundred years I would still replace you with
someone else!" They said, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, this is just
outward appearance; we still have our weapons on us." He said,
"Fine, then."z32

3.3.5. Demoting a governor to a shepherd
'Umar ibn al-Khaeb used this method with one of his
governors. Ibn Shibh narrated that 'Umar (&) appointed 'IyM ibn
Ghanam as governor of Syria, then he heard that he had acquired a
hamdm (bath) and chose an inner circle. He wrote to him, telling to
come to him. He came and 'Umar refused to meet him for three days,
then he gave him permission to enter. He called for a woollenjubbah
and said to him, "Put this on." And he gave him a shepherd's bag and
three hundred sheep and said, "Call them." So he called them, and
when he had gone some distance, he said, "Come back." So he came
back running. He said, "Do such and such, go," and he went, then
when he had gone far away, he called out to him, "0' 'Iyzd, come
hack." He kept sending him away and calling him back until he
started to sweat in that jubbah. He said, "Bring the sheep to me on
such and such a day." He brought them to bim on that day and 'Umar
came out and said, "Draw water for them." So he drew water and
filled the kough and gave them water. Then he said, "Call them, and
bring them on such and such a day." He kept doing that until two or
three months hadpassed, then he called him and said, "So, you chose
an inner circle and acquired a hamcim! Will you do it again?" He
job."233 The result of this
said, "No." 'Umar said: "Go back to
disciplinary punishment is that after that, 'Iyid became one of the
best of 'Umar's

3.3.6. Taking a w a y some of the governors' wealth
This measure was applied as a precautionary measure at the
time of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, when 'Umar felt that the wealth of
some of the governors was increasing too much, and he feared that

'Umar ibn al-Khafftb

the governors had acquired some of this wealth because of their
position.235Ibn Taymiyah commented on this action of 'Umar's and
said: "Similarly, showing favour to the governors in buying, renting,
investments, irrigation, fuming and so on is a kind of gift-giving,
hence 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib (&) took away part of the wealth of his
governors in cases where there was no room for suspicion of
misconduct because of their high level of v h e and religious
commitment. The reason why he did that was that it was a favour that
was shown to them because of their position, and because this is what
was dictated by the situation, because he was a just ruler who shared
out wealth equally.236Among the governors Erom whom 'Umar took
some of their wealth were: Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@, Abu Hurayrah and
'Amr ibn al-'AS (may Allah be pleased with them all). 'Umar would
record his governors' wealth when he appointed t h q then he would
take half of any increase, and in some cases he took all of the
in~rease."'~'
He also took away some of the wealth of some of the
governors' relatives, ifhe thought that that was justified. He took half
of Abu Bakmh's wealth, and Abu Bakrah objected, saying: "I did not
do any work for you." 'Umar said, 'But your brother is in charge of
the bayt al-mil, and he has been lending you money with which to
engage in trade."238

on several occasions, and he rebuked ' I y 8 ibn Ghanam, Khilid ibn
al-Waleed, Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari and other
There were also many written rebukes during the time of
'Umar, such as when 'Umar wrote to one of his governors when
some people had come to him, and he had given to the Arabs and not
to the nou-Arabs. 'Umar wrote: "It is sufficient evil for a man to
despise his f e l l o w - ~ u s l i r n . " ~ ~ ~
From all of this we can see that the govemors were not safe
t?om being called to account and disciplined in different ways.
Mankind had never seen anything like this in terms of justice and
courage, which made the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs a fine
example of Islamic civilization, after the era of the Prophet @)F4'
Freedom of discussion between the caliph and his governors
was guaranteed to a remarkable extent. The governors did not fear the
authority of the caliph. There follow some examples of that:
When 'Umar came to Syria, he was met by Mu'iwiyah with a
great entourage. When Mu'iwiyah saw 'Umar, he dismounted kom
his horse and walked up to him and said, "Peace be upon the
Commander of the Faithful." 'Umar walked on and did not return his
greeting, and MuC%wiyah
ran behind 'Umar's camel; he was e fat
man and he started panting. 'Abdur--%I
ibn 'Awf said: "0'
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, you have wom the man out. Why don't you
speak to h i ? " 'Umar turned to him and said, "0' Mu'kviyah, are
you the owner of the entourage that I see?" He said, "Yes, 0' Ameer
al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar said, "And in addition to that you keep away
t?om the people and those who are in need stand waiting at your

door?" Mu'iwiyah said: "Yes, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen." He said,
"Why is that, woe to you?" Mu'iwiyah said, "Because we are in a
land where the enemy has many spies, and if we do not take
precautions the enemy will no longer fear us and they will attack us.
As for the doorkeeper, we are a h i d that we will lose respect and the
people will become audacious. I am still your agent, and if you forbid
me to do that, I will stop, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar said,
"Whatever I ask you, you have an answer. If you are telling the truth,
it is a smart idea, and if you are lying, it is a smart and subtle trick. I
am not comman6mg you and I am not forbidding you." And he left
him?42
Despite 'Umar's strictness with his governors and his careful
watching of them, and his readiness to dismiss any of them of whom
he was suspicious or about whom he received well-founded
complaints, there was a strong bond of love and loyalty between
them. They had complete faith in their caliph's sincerity, soundness
of intention, policies and justice. If 'Umar lost contact with any ofhls
leaders in the arena ofjihad, the worry would almost kill him, and he
would be overwhelmed with fear and concern for them. During one
of the major wars, he went out himself to try and find news and put
his mind at rest. In other cases he met them and we see signs of the
deep love that existed between them. When 'Umar went to conquer
Jerusalem, he reached al-Jibiyah where he met his commanders
'Amr ibn al-'A? and Shurahbeel ibn Hasanah. 'Umar met them
riding, and they kissed his knees and 'Umar hugged each one of

3.4. The dismissal of Khslid ibn al-Waleed (&)
The enemies of Islam have a vivid imagination and intense
hatred which enables them to hunt out reports which show the
- Jin a bad light. If they
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (@
cannot find any reports that please them, they fabricate reports that
they think the people will accept, so that they may become a source
for narrators and authors. Both 'Umar ibn al-Khagb and Khzlid ibn
al-Waleed have been exposed to the fabrications of the enemies of
Islam who have tried to distort the historical record. They paid a great
deal of attention to the reasons why 'Umar dismissed KhZlid ibn alWaleed (may Allah be pleased with them both) and they made false
accusations against these two great men and fabricated reports which
do not stand up to close
There follows the bxe story of
the dismissal of Khilid ihn ai-Waleed, which took place in two
stages, and for which there were objective reasons.

3.4.1.The first dismissal

(4)

'Umar ibn al-Khagb
dismissed Kbilid ihn al-Waleed
for the first time from general leadership and governorship in Syria.
This happened in 13 A.H., when 'Umar succeeded to the caliphate
after the death of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq.The reason for this dismissal
was the difference in the way Abu Bakr and 'Umar dealt with their
agents and govemors. Abu Bakr's method of dealing with his
governors and agents was to give them complete freedom within the
b e w o r k of the general system of the state, subject to the condition
that they be completely just and fair between individuals and groups.
He did not mind whether he himself made sure justice was done or
his govemors did that. The governor had the right, based on the
2~

Abeeel yajib an tumha min at-Tdmekh, by Ibfieem Sha'oot, p. 123

'Umar ibn al-Khagrib

105

consent of the caliph, to run the affairs of his province without
referring every minor issue to the caliph. Abu Bakr did not see any
need to undermine the authority of his governors with regard to
wealth or anything else, so long as justice prevailed in their
provinces.245'Umar advised Abu Bakr to write to Khilid telling him
not to give anyone a sheep or a camel except by his command. Ahu
Bakr wrote to Khilid as suggested, and Khilid wrote hack to him
saying, "Leave me alone to do my work my way, otherwise you
should do it yourself." 'Umar suggested that he dismiss himx6, but
Abu Bakr left Khilid in his post."7 When 'Umar became caliph, he
thought that the caliph should set out for his governors and agents
guidelines on how to govern thelr provinces, and make it obligatory
for them to report to h m everything that happened, so that he could
examine the matter and issue commands accordingly, and they would
be obliged to carry out his commands. That was because he thought
that the caliph was responsible for what he did and for what his
governors did, and that this responsibility was not discharged even by
selecting the best governors. When he became caliph, he addressed
the people and said: "Allah is testing you by means of me and is
testing me by means of you, and he has kept me alive after my two
companions are gone. None of your affairs that I witness will I let
anyone else deal with, and none of your affairs that I do not witness
but I will strive hard to ensure that they are dealt with. If the
governors do well, I shall reward them, but if they do badly, I shall
punish them."248 And he used to say: "Do you think that if I appoint
over you the best one I know, then I enjoin him to be just, will I have
fulfilled my duty?" They said, "Yes." He said, "No, not until I

examine his work and see whether he has done what I commanded
him or not."z49
When 'Umar became caliph, he wanted the governors to
change to his methods. Some of them agreed and others refused, and
among those who refused was W d ibn al-~aleed.2~'It was
narrated ffom Milik ibn Anas that when 'Umar became caliph, he
wrote to Khglid saying: "Do not give anyone a sheep or a camel
except by my command." Khilid write back to him saying, "Either
you leave me to do my job, or you will do it yourself." 'Umar said, "I
would not be sincere towards Allah if I advised Abu Bakr to do
something then I did not implement it myself." And he dismissed
him?" Moreover he would call upon him to do things and he would
refuse unless he was given ffee rein to do what he wanted, but 'Umar
refused to allow him that?"
So 'Umar dismissed Khilid on the basis of his policy of rule
and the ruler's right to direct the affairs of state and his responsibility
for the state. Things like this happen naturally in everyday life, and
there is nothing strange about this case that would require us to by to
find an explanation based on reports, opinions, whims and desires,
and different inclinations. 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b was the caliph of the
Muslims at a time when people were still close to the time of
Prophethood, and one of his basic rights was the right to choose
govemors and commanders who were in harmony with him and his
policies and method of ruling, to work with him, so long as the
ummah had plenty of qualified people. The governors and
commanders did not have the right to remain in their posts forever,

'Umar ibn al-Khaffdb

especially when there were political differencesbetween the ruler and
the governors, so long as there were others who could replace them
and do the same job. History shows us that 'Urnar (&) was very
successful in this regard, and this policy of his met with
unprecedented success. He dismissed some and appointed others,
and the ones whom he appointed were no less qualified than those
whom he dismissed, the reason being that there was a large number
of people who were courageous and qualified to do this type of
Khilid accepted this dismissal without objecting, and he
remained under the command of Abu 'Ubaydah (&), until Allah
enabled him to conquer Qinnisreen, where Abu 'Ubaydah appointed
him as governor. He wrote to 'Umar describing the conquest and
Khilid's efforts therein, and 'Umar spoke his famous words: " M i d
has appointed himself. May Allah have mercy on Abu Bakr, he had
more knowledge of men than me."254 What 'Umar meant by this was
that Khilid, because of his courage and heroic actions, had put
himself in a position that he was used to, one of danger, courage and
taking risks. It is as if 'Umarmeant by this that Abu Bakr, by keeping
a i l i d and not agreeing to dismiss him despite 'Umar's urging, had
had great confidence in Khilid's ability and military genius, which
meant that no one else could fill his position except a very few of the
most brilliant heroes.255
At this point, Khaid had been working under the leadership of
Abu 'Ubaydah for neirly four years, and he did not go against him
even once. The vir!xe of Abu 'Ubaydah cannot be denied, for he
realized the impact that this incident had on Khilid, so he treated him
with a great deal of respect and kindness. He kept company with him,
frequently consulting him and respecting his opinion, and sometimes

placing him in positions of leadership. All of this had an impact in
leaving Khilid's heart free of rancour, which led him to perform
those heroic military deeds. His efforts in the conquests of Damascus,
Qinnisreen and Fahl bore witness to the noble spirit in which he
reacted to his dismissal. In both cases (i.e., before and after his
dismissal) he was the Sword of Allah, Khilid ibn al-Waleed (may
AUah be pleased with him).256
History has recorded for us what Abu 'Ubaydah said when he
consoled W d at the time of his dismissal: "It is not worldly power
that I seek and it is not for this world that I strive. What you see will
cease and come to an end. Rather we are brothers who are fulfilling
the command of AUah, and it doesn't matter if a man has his brother
in charge of his religious and worldly affairs. Rather the one who is in
charge knows that he is more vulnerable to temptations and sin
because he is in a vulnerable position, except for those whom Allah
protects, and they are few."257
When Abu 'Ubaydah asked Khilid to cany out a military
mission under his command, Khilid accepted, saying: "I will do it,
insha' Allih. I was only waiting for you to tell me." Abu 'Ubaydah
said, "I felt too shy to ask you, 0' Abu Sulaydn." Khilid said, "By
Allah, if a little child had been appointed over me, I would have
obeyed him. How can I go against you when you came to Islam
before me and you came to Islam with those who hastened to enter
the Faith, and the Messenger of Allah
called you al-Ameen (the
trustworthy one)? How can I catch up with you and achieve your
status? Now I ask you to bear witness that I devote myself solely for
the sake of Allah and I will never disobey you or accept any position
of governorship after this." Khilid did not stop there; rather he

w)

'Umnr ibn n l - K h a e b

109

followed his words with actions, and immediately went and carried
out the mission that was asked of him.258
It is clear from Khad's words and actions that religious and
moral motives played a major role in the actions of Khilid and Abu
'Ubaydah (may AUah be pleased with them both). KhStlid adhered to
the principle of obedience to the caliph and the governor, despite the
fact that his personal situation had changed from that of leader to that
of follower, because of his dismissal from leadership of the my?59
The dismissal of Khilid on this occasion (the first) was not because
the caliph had any doubts about him or bore any grudges against him,
or because he had transgressed the sacred limits of shari'ah, or
because any aspersions had been cast on Khilid's piety and justice,
But there were two different methods adopted by two great men, two
powerful personalities, each of whom thought it was essential to
implement his own method. If one of them had to give in, the leader
of the army had to give in to the caliph, without being stubborn or
bearing any grudge or re~entment?~'
By the guidance of Allah, 'Umar appointed Abu 'Ubaydah as
commander of the army in Syria, which after the battle of Y m o o k
was an area which needed peace, so that grudges would end, wounds
would heal and hearts would be reconciled. Abu 'Ubaydah
hastened to make peace when the opporhmity was there, but he did
not shy away from war when it was necessary. If there was a way for
peace, that is the way he would follow, otherwise he would prepare
for war. The people of the cities in Syria had heard of Abu
'Ubaydah's forbearance, so they came to surrender to him, they
preferred to deal with him than with anyone else. Abu 'Ubaydah's
appointment was by 'Umar's instruction, and his governorship of

Syria at that point was in the province's best interests.z6'

3.4.2. The second dismissal
The second dismissal of Khilid came in Qinnisreen in 17
A.H?~' News reached 'Umar that Khiilid and 'Iyw ibn Ghanam had
penetrated into Byzantine territory and had come back with a great
amount of booty, and that men had come to K h a d from far and wide,
hoping for his generosity, including al-Ash'ath ibn Qays al-Kindi, to
whom Khilid gave ten thousand. Nothing was hidden from 'Umar of
what he did.263 'Umar wrote to his commander, Abu 'Ubaydah,
ordering him to investigate the source of the wealth from which he
had given al-Ash'ath this huge sum, and to dismiss him from
working with the army at all. He summoned Khilid to Madeenah and
questioned him in the presence of Abu 'Ubaydah. In the end, Khilid
was proven innocent of taking ten thousand from the booty of the
~ u s l i r n sWhen
. ~ ~ ~K h a d was told of his dismissal, he bade farewell
to the people of Syria. The most that he allowed himself to show of
the sorrow that he felt at this separation of a commander and his
troops was when he said to the people: "The Ameer al-Mu'mineen
appointed me as governor in Syria until things started to become
smooth and sweet, then he dismissed me." A man stood up and said,
"Be patient, 0' commander, for it is the time forfitnah." KhSd said,
"So long as the son of al-Khatj2h is alive, there is no room for

Khilid's nerves during this grave situation, what inspired Khilid to
give this quiet and wise answer?266The people calmed down after
they heard what Khilid said in support of 'Umar's caliphate. They
realized that their dismissed leader was not the type of man who
would build his glory by stirring up tribulation and revolution, rather
he was one of those men who are created to play a constructive role,
and if circumstances want them to destroy what they have built, they
rise above that.267
Khilid travelled to Madeenah, where he met 'Umar. Khilid
said to 'Umar: "I complained about you to the Muslims, and by Allah
you are not being kind to me, 0' 'Umar." 'Umar asked, "From where
did this wealth come?" He said, "From my share of the booty.
Whatever is more than sixty thousand is yours." 'Umar estimated the
wealth and found it to be twenty thousand, which he put into the bayt
al-rncil, then he said, "0' Khilid, by Allah you are dear to me and you
will not be upset with me after today."268 'UIIIX mote to the regions,
saying: "I did not dismiss Khilid because I was angry with him or
because of any misconduct on his part; rather the people were too
attached to him and I feared that Allah would leave them to him and
they would be tested because of him. I wanted them to know that
Allah is the One Who brings victory, so that they would not be
confused about this fact."

3.4.3. Summary of the reasons for the
dismissal and some of its benefits
Based on the way in which 'Umar conducted his affairs, we
can sum up the reasons for Khilid's dismissal as follows:

The Fiqh of 'Umar ibn al-Kha$$rib

Protection of Tawheed
From 'Umar's words, "rather the people were too attached to
him and I feared that they would be left to him and they would be
tested because of him" it is clear that 'Umar feared that the people
would become confused because of Khilid and they would think that
victory came wherever Khilid went, which would weaken their
certain faith that victory comes &om Allah whether Khilid was at the
head of the army or not. Too much attachment to a great commander
like Khilid would also lead Khilid himself to become attached to his
followers, and he might think himself in a posihon of power which
could not be challenged, especially since he was brilliant in war and
generous with money. That could lead to bad consequences for him
and for the state. Even though it may have been a far-fetched
possibility, given the fact that the people were attached to their caliph
'Umar and felt great admiration for him, and Khilid was a man of
great military discipline and piety, it could, however, happen one day
after 'Umar was gone, even with a leader such as Khaid. This
requlred setting up gwdelines at that time and with great people such
as these.269In such a situation the fear is greater with regard to a
competent commander than a lesser commander who has no such
image or reputahon.z70

Differences concerning how money is to be spent
'Umar thought that the time for softening hearts and attracting
the weak in faith with money and gifts had come to an end; Islam no
longer needed these people, and the people could be left to their own
faith and conscience. Khillid, on the other hand, thought that some of
those courageous men and Mujihideen who were fighting alongside

him were men whose intention was not purely to seek the reward of
Allah, and that men such as these needed some of this wealth to
strengthen their resolve and motivate them further.271'Umar thought
that the poor of the Muhijireen were more entitled to this wealth than
others. When he told the people in al-Jibiyah of his reasons for
dismissing Khilid, he said: "I told him to keep this money to be spent
on the weak ones among the Muhiijireen, but he gave it to men of
power and strength."272Undoubtedly 'Umar and Khilid both had
strong arguments for their opinions, but 'Umar understood some
things that Khilid did not.273

Difference between the methods of 'Umar
and &"lid in administrative issues
'Umar insisted that his governors should ask his permission
for every matter, major or minor, whereas as Khilid thought that he
was entitled to complete fi-eedomwith no need to refer to anyone else
in the field ofjihad; he thought that he should be given free rein to do
whatever he saw fit, on the grounds that the one who is present sees
what the one who is absent does not.274
Perhaps another reason was to allow room for new leadership
talent to grow, so that the Muslim dcould produce more heroes
of the calibre of Khilid, al-Muthanna and 'Amr ibn al-'&. Another
aim was to make the people realize that victory was not tied to a
single man275,no matter who this man was.

The attitude of the Muslim society towards this dismissal
The Muslim society accepted this dismissal as the right of the
caliph to appoint and dismiss his governors. No one had the right to
rebel against the system or reject the right of the caliph to appoint and
dismiss his governors.
It was narrated that 'Umar went out in the middle of the night
and met 'Alqamah ibn 'Ulithah al-Kilibi. 'Umar resembled Khilid
to a remarkable extent and 'Alqamah thought that he was Khilid. He
said, "0' Khi2id, this man has dismissed you and has insisted on
being mean. I came with a cousm of mine to ask him something, but
because he did what he did, I will never ask him anything." 'Urnar
said to him -trying to find out what he was hidmg -"Well, tell me
more." He said, "These people have rights over us and we have to
give them their rights, and Allah will reward us." The next mommg,
'Umar asked Khilid -when 'Alqamah was l o o h g at both of them
- "What did 'Alqamah say to you last night?" Khilid said, "By
Allah, he did not say anything." 'Umar then asked, "Are you
swearing to that?" 'Alqamah got upset and thought that he had not
and he started to say,
spoken to anyone the night before but -4
"Come on, 0' m l i d . " 'Umar was generous to 'Alqamah and met
his need, and he said, "If there were more people out there who think
like you -i.e., were keen to obey the ruler even when they disagree
with him - that would be dearer to me than such and
However an objection came from Abu 'Amr ibn Hafs ibn alMugheerah, the cousin of Khilid ibn al-Waleed, at al-Jiibiyah. When
'Umar said to the people: "I will tell you the reason why (I dismissed)
KhSllid ibn al-Waleed; I ordered him to keep this wealth for the weak
ones among the Muhijireen, but he gave it to men of power and
strength, those who were of bigh status and eloquent. So I dismissed

him and appointed Abu 'Ubaydah ibn J d h , " Abu 'Amr ibn Hafs
ibn al-Mugheerah said, "By Allah, you have not justified it, 0'
'Umar ibn al-KhatJib. You have dismissed a commander who was
appointed by the Messenger of Allah @), and you have sheathed a
sword that was unsheathed by the Messenger of Allah @J, and you
have taken down a banner that was set up by the Messenger of Allah
(@J. You have severed the ties of kmship and shown jealousy
towards your cousin." 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib said, "You are closely
related to him, and young in age, and angry for the sake of your
cousin."z77 Thus 'Umar showed tolerance to the cousin of Khilid ibn
al-Waleed who was defending Khilid to such an extent that he
accused 'Umar ofjealousy (basad). But despite that, 'Umar remained
patient.278

The death of Khilid ibn al-Waleed and what h e
said about 'Umar w h e n he was o n his deathbed
Abu ad-Dard? went to see Khiilid during his final illness and
Khilid said to him: "0' Abu ad-DarW, when 'Umar dies, you will
see things that you dislike." Abu ad-Dardi' said to him, "By Allah, I
agree with you." Khilid said, "I got upset with him for a certain
issue, but when I thought about it when I got sick and felt that death is
at hand, I realized that 'Umar seeks to please Allah in all that he does.
I got upset with him when he sent someone to take half of my wealth,
and he even took one shoe and I took the other. But he did that to
others who had come to Islam earlier than me, and who had been
present at Badr He was harsh with me, but he was similarly harsh
with others. I expected him to treat me well because we were closely
related, but I saw that he did not care about that and he did not wony

about the blame of anyone for the sake of the truth. That is what took
away the feelings I had about hi.He got upset with me, but it was
only because we had different views. I was there in the arena of war,
strimg hard. I was there and he was not. I used to give based on the
circumstances and he did not like that."z79When death approached
and he realized that, he wept and said: "There is no deed that I have
done that gives me more hope, after saying Lli il6ha illa-All6h, than
an intensely cold night with a raiding party of the Muhrijreen, wbich
I spent canying my shield m the rain, waiting for morning to come so

such and such battles, and there is no place on my body the size of a

by an arrow or spear, but here I am, dying on my bed as a camel dies.
May the cowards never prosper. I sought death in the places where it
may be sought, but it was only decreed that I should die on my own
bed."280 Khilid asked 'Umar to execute his will, in which it said: "I
entrust my affairs, my estate and the execution of my wlll to 'Umar
ibn al-Khagb." 'Umar (4)
wept and mourned deeply for him, and
the daughtem of his paternal uncle also wept for him. It was said to
'Umar that he should tell them to stop, but he said: "Let them weep
for Abu Sulaymin so long as they are not eulogizing hlm or babbling.
For the like of Abu Sulaymiin let the weepers weep."281
And he said concerning him, "A hole has developed in the
structure of Islam." When Hishim ibn al-Bakhtari came to 'Umar
with some people &om Banu Makhzoom, 'Umar said to Hishim,
who was a poet, "Recite to me what you said about Khilid." When
he recited it, he said, 'You have fallen short in praising Abu

lived."' NO one will live forever."283 He died and was buried in

him and raise his status among the righteous.

The Conquests of Iraq and the
East at the Time of 'Umar

-

1. The Second Stage of the Conquest of
Iraq and the East
t / J h e conquests in Iraq at the time of Abu Bakr, under the
leadership of Kh2lid ibu al-Weed, represent the fust stage of the
Islamic conquests which spread out towards the east. They have been
discussed in detail in my book Abu Bala
Shakhsiyatuhu wa
Xsruhu. During the reign of 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (41
there
, were
further conquests.

1.1. The appointment of Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi
as leader of the war in Iraq
When Abu Bakr died and was buried at night on Tuesday 22
Jurncida al-ikhirah 13 A.H., the following morning 'Umar exhorted
the people to fight the people of Iraq and he reminded them of the
reward for that. But no one responded because the people did not like
to fight the Persians, due to their strength and toughness in fighting.
He exhorted them again on the second and third days, and no one
responded. Al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah spoke well and told them of
the conquests of most of the land of Iraq that Allah had granted at the
hands of Khaid, and of the wealth and property that was there. But

120

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the lEme o f 'Umar

no one responded on the third day. On the fourth day, the fmt of the
Muslims to respond was Abu 'Ubayd ibn Mas'ood ath-Thaqafi, then
the people responded one after another.' Saleet ibn Qays al-AnsZ
responded to the call of 'Umar after Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi and
said: "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, I am giving myself for the sake of
Allah as do those of my cousins who agree to come and others who
have joined me."' These words of Saleet had a strong impact,
encouraging the people, raising their morale and increasmg their
desire for jihad against the Persians. They asked the caliph to appoint
a man kom among the Muhijireen or Ansir over them, and 'Umar
said: "By Allah, I cannot h d anyone who is more deserving of that
than the one who encouraged the people first. Were it not that Saleet
is too hasty in war, I would have appointed him over you. But Abu
'Ubayd is the commander and Saleet is his adviser." The people said,
"We mll listen and obey."3 According to another report: "He
appointed Abu 'Ubayd over them all, although he was not a Sahibz.
It was said to 'Umar, 'Why didn't you appoint a man kom the
SahGbah over them?' He said, 'Rather I will appoint the first one who
responded. You became superior to the people because of your
support for this religion, but he is the one who responded before you.'
Then he called him and advised him with regard to himself to fear
Allah and with regard to the Musllms to be kind to them. He
commanded him to consult the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah @) and to consult Saleet ibn Qays, because he was a man who
was experienced in war."4
'Umar's advice to Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi included the
following words: "Listen to the Companions of the Messenger of

' Al-Bidriyah wa an-Nihriyah, 7126.

AUah &) and let them have a say in this matter. Do not m h into
decisions, rather take your time, for war cannot be led except by a
man who takes his time in making decisions and who knows the right
time to move. Nothing prevented me &om appointing Saleet but his
haste. Being hasty in war, except in cases where the situation is clear,
will lead to doom."' Then he said: "You are going to a land of
treachery, betrayal and oppression. You are going to people who are
audacious in committing evil and know it well; they have forgomn
good and become ignorant of it. So see what you will do. Watch what
you say and do not disclose your secrets, for so long as the one who
has a secret and is keeping it, he will be safe, but if he does not keep
the secret, that will be the cause of his doom."6
Then he commanded al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah to go ahead,
and the army would catch up with him. He commanded him to go out
and mobilize those of the apostates who had truly repented. So he set
out, hastening until he reached al-Heerah. 'Umar followed the events
on the konts in Iraq and Syria, supplying the army with provisions
and reinforcements, sending instructions and commands to them and
setting out battle plans which he himself supervised.
The Muslims, who were seven thousand strong, marched
towards Iraq. 'Umar wrote to Abu 'Ubaydah, telling him to send
whoever was in Iraq of those who had been with Khilid in Iraq. So he
equipped ten thousand men, led by Hishim ibn 'Utbah. 'Umar sent
Jareer ibn 'Abdulliih al-Bajali with four thousand men to Iraq, and he
came to Koofah. When the people arrived in Iraq, they found the
Persians in a state of political turmoil. The latest development was
that B o o h the daughter of Chosroes had become their queen after
they had killed her predecessor A z d d a k h t . B o o h delegated the

&g
of the kingdom's affairs to a man called Rustam ibn
Farrakhz$d, on the basis that he would conduct the war, and the
power would be returned to the family of Chosroes, which he
accepted. This Rustam was an astrologer who knew the stars very
well. It was said to him, "What made you do that?" meaning, when
you know that this is not going to last. He said: "Greed and the love
of power."7

1.2. The Battle of an-Nami%iq, the Battle of asSaqztiyah in Kaskar, and the Battle of Baroosma
1.2.1. The battle of an-N&q

13 A.H.

This battle followed the arrival of Abu 'Ubayd ibn Mas'ood
ath-Thaqafi and his assumption of military command in Iraq. It is as
if the Persians wanted to fiighten Abu 'Ubayd at the outset, when he
was new in his position, so as to break his mll and make hnn despair
of victory. So they prepared the civllxans and mobilized their troops,
and met the Muslims there (in an-Namcq), from behind and from in
h n t . They wrote to the chieftains of the masses telling them to revolt
against the Muslims, and they sent to every region a man to stir up the
people. They sent Jabin to al-Babahaqqabidh al-Asfal, and Narsi to
Kaskar, and they sent troops to fight al-Muthanna... Al-Muthanna
heard news of that, so he got the army to keep a lookout and was very
cautious. The chieftains revolted one after another, and the people of
various regions revolted one afier another. Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqati
and al-Muthanna camped in Kh-,
then the battle took place in alNam%iq. The fighting was intense, but AUah defeated the Persians.
The commanders Jabin and Mardinshah, who were leading the two

'Umaribn al-Khatjib

123

flanks of the army, were taken prisoner; together, they had led the
revo~t.~
The one who captured Jabin was M a w ibn F u d w atTameemi, who did not know who he was. Jabin tricked him by
offering him something to let him go, but the Muslims caught him
and brought him to Abu 'Ubayd. They told him that he was the leader
of the Persians and suggested that he execute him. He said: "I fear
Allah if I kill h i when one of the Muslims guaranteed his safety."
The Muslims, in their mutual love and support, are like a single body,
and what is bindmg on one is binding on all. They said, "He is the
king," meaning the leader. He said, "Even so, I will not betray (that
guarantee)," and he let him go.9
This attitude on the part of Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi is regarded as an
example of M u s h tolerance and their fulfilment of covenants, even
if only some of them had agreed to them. Undoubtedly this sublime
attitude had a great impact in attracting people to enter Islam, when
news spread among the people that the Muslims had let one of the
Persian leaders go, one of their worst enemies, simply because one
Muslim had agreed to set him free in return for a ransom. They were
attracted to this religion which produced such men. We should not
forget the brilliant attitude of al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah, when Abu
'Ubayd became the commander, even though he was coming to Iraq
for the first time because the caliph had appointed him. He was a
good commander and a good soldier. This was one of the
characteristics of al-Muthanna. He had done the same thing with
Khaid ibn al-Waleed before, and his service to Islam was no different
whether he was a leader or a soldier. Such are great men.''

124

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

1.2.2. The battle of as-Saqgtiyah in Kaskar
Then Abu 'Ubayd went after those who had fled, who had
sought refuge in the city of ~askar",which was under the command
of a nephew of Chosroes whose name was Narsi. Narsi had supported
the fight against Abu 'Ubayd. Abu 'Ubayd met them in asSaqitiyah1', where he defeated them and acquired a great deal of
booty and food. l3 Narsi fled, and the Muslims defeated his army and
took over his land, and found a large amount of supplies in his stores.

Abu 'Ubayd stayed in Kaskar and sent forces to pursue the
Persians and discipline the people of neighbowing towns who had
broken the treaty and supported the Persians. The Muslims prevailed
in the region after this victory. Some governors came seeking peace
treaties, two of whom brought some of their fmest food to Abu
'Ubayd and said, "This is to honour you." He said, "Have you
honoured the rest of the troops in the same manner?" They said, "It is
not easy, but we will do that." Abu 'Ubayd said, 'We have no need of
it if there is not enough for all the troops." Then they got scared and
feared for their lives. Abu 'Ubayd said, "Do you not know that I will
only eat if there is enough for those who are with me?" They said,
"There is no one left who has not had his fill of this and more in their
camp." When he realized that, he accepted it fkom them. He ate some
and he sent some to some guests whom he had invited to eat with
him. These visitors had some of that Persian food, and they did not
think that Abu 'Ubayd would have such food. They thought that they
were being invited to eat the kind of coarse food that Abu 'Ubayd
usually ate, and they did not like to leave the food that had been
brought to them. They said, "Tell the commander, we do not want to
leave anything that the chieflains have brought to us." He sent word

to them saying, "There is a lot of Persian food, come and compare it
with what you had."14
This noble and humble commander ate after he had refused the
Persians' food twice, because he realized, the third time, that they had
fed all the troops with similar food and more. He did not llke to eat
until he had called his visitors and urged them to eat, and he knew
that they had had some of that Persian food and he listed the types of
food, to encourage them to join him. This is a kind of noble
generosity, and it is one of the most important elements of leadership.
This attitude shows us the sublime level of noble attitudes that the
Sahdbah (may Allah be pleased with them all) and those who
followed them had reached."

1.2.3. The battle of Baroosma 13 A.H.
Then they met m a place between Kaskar and as-Saqitiyah
which was called Baroosma. On the right and left flanks of Narsi's
army were two of his cousins, Bandawayh and Beerawayh. Rustam
had put the army under the command of Jalinus. When Abu 'Ubayd
heard of that, he hastened to fight before the rest came. The fighting
was intense, and the Persians were defeated and Narsi fled. Abu
'Ubayd sent al-Muthanna ibn Htirithah and other troops to some
areas of that region, such as the river of Jawr which they conquered
by means of treaties and by force. They lmposed the jizyah and
k h a r i j , and captured a great deal of booty, praise be to Allah. They
defeated Jalms, who had come to support Jab%, and captured a lot
of booty from his army and seized his wealth, and he fled to his
people, humiliated and defeated.I6

Thus the three armies of Persia were destroyed in a short
period of time. The Persians could have united these armies and
attacked the Muslims from all sides, because of their great numbers,
but Allah made them confused and because of their great fear of the
Muslims, each commander was hoping that the other would do the
job and weaken the Muslims so that he could come and claim victory.
What benefited the Muslims was their ability to move quickly, in
contrast to the slow movements of the enemy army.17

1.3. Abu 'Ubayd's battle of the bridge 13 A.H.
When al-Jalinus fled from the Muslims, the Persians
regrouped and gathered around Rustam. He mobilized a huge army
led by Bahman Jidhawayh and gave him the flag of Chosroes which
was called Dirafsh Kaby%n (which means "great flag") and which the
Persians regarded as lucky. It was made of tiger sluns, and was eight
cubits wide and twelve cubits long. They reached where the Muslims
were, and between them was a river, crossed by a bndge. They sent
word saying, "Either you cross over to us, or we will cross over to
you." The Musl~msaid to theu commander Abu 'Ubayd, "Tell them
to cross over to us." He said: "They are not more courageous than we
are." Then he crossed over to them and they met in a narrow place,
where they fought intensely. The Muslims had nearly ten thousand
men. The Persians had brought elephants with them, which were
wearing a lot of bells, to scare the Muslims' horses. Every t3me they
attacked the Muslims, the horses fled from the elephants, because of
the sound of those bells. Only a few horses could be made to stand
firm,with great difficulty. When the Muslims attacked them,their
horses would not go near the elephants, and the Persians hit them

i

'Umar ibn al-Khat@b

127

with mows and killed many people. But the Muslims still managed
to kill six thousand of themla
The Muslims' horses were scared of the sound of the bells
worn by the elephants, and the Muslims could not reach the enemy
with the elephants scaring their horses, so Abu 'Ubayd went on foot
and the people did likewise, and they started fighting them with their
swords. The Muslims lost their horses and became foot soldiers,
iighting the Persian elephants, horsemen and foot soldiers, as well as
the archers who struck the Muslims as they were trying to drive their
horses forward, and the horses were refusing. It was a difficult
situation, but the Muslims showed great courage and sacrifice, such
as has rarely been seen in history. They stood up to the Persians
despite their superiority in weaponry and means of fighting. The
elephants were the worst weapon faced by the Muslims, for they had
thrown their ranks into disarray. Abu 'Ubayd called them to focus on
the elephants, cut their saddle straps and push their riders off. He
himself started with the white elephant; he hung onto its strap and cut
it, and its riders fell off. The Muslims did likewise, not leaving any
elephant but they pushed its riders off and killed them. But the
elephants continued to attack, because they had been trained to do so.
Abu 'Ubayd thought that he should get rid of them, so he asked how
they could be killed, and he was told that if he cut off their trunks,
they would die. So he attacked the white elephant and struck its trunk
with the sword, but the elephant defended itself with its foreleg,
bowing him to the ground and then stepping on him. His brother alHakam ibn Mas'ood took the flag and fought the elephant until he
managed to get it off Abu 'Ubayd, but the same thing happened to
him as had happened to Abu 'Ubayd. Al-Hakam wanted to kill it, but
it threw him down with its foreleg and stepped on him. The Muslim

128

flag passed to those who had been named by Abn 'Ubayd, including
his three sons, Wahb, M u and Jabr, until they were all killed, then
leadership passed to al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah, at the end of the day.
Some of the Muslims had crossed the bridge, retreating, and the
withdrawal from the battlefield continued. When 'Ahdull21 ibn
Marthad ath-Thaqafi saw that, he hastened to cut the bridge, and said:
"Die for the same cause as your commanders died, or be victorious!"
He tried to stop the people crossing the bridge, so they brought him to
al-Muthanna, who hit him because he was so angy with what he had
done. He said: "What made you do that?" He said, "So that they
would fight." But his idea was not appropriate, because cutting the
bridge led to some of the Muslims falling into the river and drowning,
because of the intense pressure from the Persians. But the idea of the
Muslims protecting those who were left by withdrawing if they could
was the right idea. This is what al-Muthanna did when he ordered that
the bridge be restored. He and the Muslim heroes wiih him stood and
protected the Muslims' backs until they had crossed. Al-Muthanna
said: "0' people, we will protect you; take your time to cross (the
bridge) and do not rush, for we will not leave until we see that you are
on the other side. Do not drown yourselves." Muthanna and the
heroes who were with him, such as 'ASim ibn 'Amr and al-Kalj adDabbi, were the last ones to cross. Bahman J2dhawayh tried to
destroy the remaining Muslims, but he was not able to. M u h a
robbed him of this opportunity when he took charge of this organized
withdrawal. Undoubtedly these heroes who protected the Muslims'
backs until they had withdrawn strove their utmost in standing hm
before the enemy. Five thousand Muslims withdrew, leaving behind
four thousand martyrs, among whom was a large number of the
Sahiibah (may Allah be pleased with them), especially those who had
accompanied Abu 'Ubayd from Madeenah. Two thousand of those
who withdrew returned to Madeenah and elsewhere, and only three
thousand stayed with al-Muthanna. As for the Persians, six thousand

'Umar ibn al-Kha@&b

129

of them had been killed, despite the bad situation in which the
Muslims had found themselves, which is indicative of their courage
and steadfastness.19

The most important lessons of
Abu 'Ubayd's battle of the bridge
1.3.1. True dreams
Dawmah, the wife of Abu 'Ubayd, had seen a dream in which
a man came down from heaven with a vessel in which there was a
drink. Abu 'Ubayd, his son Jabr and some of his family drank from it.
She told Abu 'Ubayd about that and he said: "This is martyrdom."
Abu 'Ubayd amounced to the people: "If I am killed, then So and so
is in charge of the people," and he listed seven men of Thaqeef, who
were relatives of his whom his wife had seen in her dream. When the
last of them was killed, leadership passed to al-Muthanna ibn
~irithah.~~

1.3.2. Two mistakes which led to defeat
Abu 'Ubayd went against the advice of the army commanders
and prominent figures who were with him, who told him not to cross
the bridge, but he did not pay attention. He went his own way and
crossed the bridge with great courage and the desire for martyrdom,
but he did not plan properly for the battle. He did not study the lay of
the land s~fficientl~.~'
He lost an element of security when he
confined himself to a place with a narrow exit and it is as if he led his

130

The Conquests ofIraq and the East a t the Eme of 'Umar

army into a trap with no reason. He lost the advantage of using
different types of weapons together when his horsemen no longer
played a role in the battle, and his forces had to proceed on foot with
no cavalry, and they had to face the infanw, cavalry and elephants of
the Persians. There was no efficient leadership in this battle until alMuthanna tinally took over, after the seven who had gone before
h i . He also forfeited the ability to manoeuvre his troops properly
because of the narrowness of the place, as the large number of his
troops was no use m unsuitable terrain, and he did not succeed in
choosing a good battle plan to help him achieve his aims. He lost all
that, and in fact he handed it all to the enemy to use against him?'
What made Abu 'Ubayd's error worse was another mistake
which compounded the first. This was the mistake made by
'Abdnll5h ihn Marthad ath-Thaqafi when he cut the bndge so that
none of the Muslims could retreat. Were it not for the grace of Allah,
then the steadfastness of al-Muthanna ibn H&ithah and those who
were with hlm, all the Muslims would have been killed.23

1.3.3. The value of strong leadership in the field
The battle of the bridge proves the importance of strong
leadership in the field, as represented by al-Muthanna and the
commanders who were with him. When calamity befell the army,
those leaders who could do so brought their troops out of that
situation." With the help of those heroes, al-Muthanna was able to
protect the Muslim army and he was the last one to cross the bridge.
This is one of the noblest kinds of sacrifi~e.'~

1.3.4. Al-Muthanna raised the morale of his troops
Al-Muthma withdrew with four thousand troops who were
left from the original number of ten thousand, and he began his
pursuit of the two Persian leaders, Jabin and Mardanshab, in the
direction of Alees (as-Samiwih). Al-Muthanna pwsued them for a
long distance, because he did not want them to launch a counterattack until they had gone far from the place of withdrawal. When he
reached as-Samiwih, he launched a sudden and shocking attack with
his cavalry, which he himself led, and defeated them. It seems that the
element of surprise, and the fact that they could not imagine that a
man who has lost most of his army would be able to show such
resolve, left the Persians stunned by this attack, and they suffered
great losses as a result. Al-Muthanna managed to capture the two
leaders, whom be executed. This victory had an immense impact on
strengthening the morale of those who were left of his army and of
the local mhabitants; it also raised the status of al-Muthanna in the
eyes of his troops and the neighbouring tribes.26

1.3.5. Every time the Muslims are faced
with a dilemma, Allah will create
the means to get them out of that
Al-Muthanna stayed in Iraq with a small number who were not
enough to guard the lands and possessions that the Muslims had
gained. The Persians could have driven the remnant of the Muslim
army out of Iraq, and they would have found that the Arabs who were
still loyal to them would chase the Muslims out into the desert. But
Allah was with this believing group as He is with the believers in all
places. Every time the sincere Muslims fall into a dilemma, Allah
creates the means for them to get out of that. Allah created something

reached the Persian ruler, Bahman Jzdhawayh, and he hastened to
return to al-MaWin, as he was one who was looked up to in political
affairs. Thus Allah spared the Muslims ftom fighting and He spared
them from calamity. This gave them the opportunity to receive
reinforcements coming from Madeenah to strengthen them and make
their army bigger2'

1.4. The battle of al-Buwayb 13 A.H.
'Umar mobilized the people and sent reinforcements to the
Muslim army in Iraq, among whom were Jareer ibn 'Abdullih alBajali and his people, and Handhalah
ibn ar-Rabee'. He also sent
Hila ibn 'Alqamah and a group &om the tribes of Khath'am under
the leadership of 'Abdull31 ibu Dhi as-Sahmayn. He also sent them
to Iraq to join the Muslim troops there. Both 'Umar ibn Rib'i ibn
Hanaalah, with his people, and Rib'i ibn 'h
ibn Kh2id came to
the caliph and he sent them to join the troops in Iraq too. Thus
columns of reinforcements came one after another, marching towards
Iraq. At the same time, al-Muthanna ibn Hhithah as-Shaybki sent
word to the Muslim commanders in Iraq, W g for support, and they
sent reinforcements to iucrease the size of his army.'
When the Persian leaders found out that a huge army had
gathered around al-Muthanna, they sent Makin al-Hamadhhi with
an army of horsemen to conftont the army of al-Muthanna. When alMuthanna found out about that, he wrote to the reinforcements who
were coming to him, telling them to join him at al-Buwayb. These

''At-Tdreekh al-IsIbni, 101345, 346.

'Umar ibn al-Khagtrfb

133

reinforcements were being led by Jareer ibn 'Abdulliih, and when alMuthanna wrote to him, he said: "A new development has arisen and
we cannot wait here until you join us, so hasten to join us and we will
met in al-Buwayb." So they met m al-Buwayb, and there was
nothing between them and the Persian army but the river. AlMuthanna waited until Mahriin wrote to him and said: "Either you
cross over to us or we will cross over to you." Al-Muthanna said,
"Cross over." So M a h h crossed over with his m y . That happened
in Rams* 13A.H. Al-Muthanna stood up and addressed his troops,
and said to the Muslims: 'You are fasting and fasting weakens you; I
thii that you should break your fast and eat something to gain
strength to fight your enemy." They agreed to that and broke their
fast. Then al-Muthanna prepared his army and went around
encouraging them to fight, saying to every group: "I hope that the
Arabs will not be defeated because of you. By Allah, there is nothing
that I want for myself this day that I do not want for you." The
narrators said that al-Muthanna was kind to them in word and deed,
and he stayed with the people at times of hardship and times of ease;
no one could find fault with him in word or deed.29This is indicative
of his good leadership and great wisdom, and of the fact that the anny
obeyed him out of love and conviction. When al-Muthanna was
pleased with the army's preparations he said, "I will say takbeer three
times, so get ready, then attack when I say it the fourth time." But
when he said the first takbeer, the Persians attacked first, so they
rushed forward and engaged with them with the first takbeer. It was
not the Persians' custom to rush into battle, but perhaps what had
happened at the battle of the bridge, where the Muslims were
defeated, had taken away some of the Persians' fear of the Muslims.
Thus the Persians began the attack, and the Muslims stood firm and
continued to engage in heavy fighting with them. As well as

134

The Conquests ofIraq and the E a t at the Time of 'Umar

participating in the fighting, al-Muthanna was also watching
carefully over his army. Whenever he saw any weak point, he sent a
man there to tell them, "The commander sends his salim to you and
says: "Do not expose the Muslims to danger today." They agreed and
filled the gap.30
When the battle had raged fiercely for a long time, alMuthanna said to Anas ibn Hilil: "0' Anas, if you see me attacking
M&%n, join me," and he said likewise to Ibn Mardi al-Fahr. Then alMuthanna attacked M e , and pushed him towards the right flank.
Al-Muthanna continued to put pressure on his army. The cores of the
two armies met in combat and the dust flew up; the flanks were also
fighting and could not come to the aid of their leaders, either the
mushrikoon or the Musllms. Mas'ood ibn Hiirithah, the commander
of the Muslim infantry, said to his troops: "If you see that we are
struck, do not stop fighting, for you will expose the army and cause
defeat. Stick to your positions and do not leave any gaps."31
Mas'ood and other Muslim commanders were struck, and Mas'ood
saw his troops wavering because he had been hit and was weak and
heavily wounded. He said, "0' troops of Bakr ibn W?il, raise your
flags, may Allah grant you victory! Do not be stunned because of my
death." Al-Muthanna realized that his brother had been struck so he
addressed the people, saying, "0' Muslims, do not worry about my
brother being struck, for the best of you die in that manner."
Anas ibn Hilil an-Numayri fought until he was struck. AlMuthanna carried him and carried his brother Mas'ood, and brought
them to his tent. The fighting was still raging all along the ffont, but
in the heart of the battle the tide began to turn against the Persians.
The core of the Muslim army inflicted heavy losses on the Persian

core, and al-Muthma drove a wedge into the core of the Persian
army. Among those who penetrated the Persian army was Jareer ibn
'Abdulliih, along with Bajeer, Ibn al-Hawbar and al-Mundhir ibn
Hassin, and the people of I?abbah who were with them. Que ibn
Jam& al-'Abdi fought until many spears and swords were broken in
his hand; he killed Shahr B&, one of the Persian chieftains and the
leader of their cavalry. The fighting continued until the Muslims
destroyed the core of the Persian army and penetrated deep into dieir
ranks. 32 Al-Muthma stood where the dust was thick until it settled,
and the core of the rnushrik army had been finished off and their
commander M
e had been killed, but the flanks of the armies
were still fighting one another. When the Muslims on the flanks saw
that the core of the army had been defeated and its people were dead,
their resolve against the mushrikeen was strengthened and they
started chasing the Persians. Al-Muthanna and the Muslims in the
core were praying for their victory, until the Muslims defeated the
Persians. Then al-Muthanna rushed to the bridge before the Persians
got there and cut it, and the Persians spread all over the banks of the
Euphrates and the Muslim horsemen attacked them and killed them,
leaving their bodies in heaps. Some narrators report that the number
of their slain reached one hundred thousand.33

1.4.1.The council of war after the battle
The fighting ceased and al-Muthanna and the Muslim9 looked
at the tens of thousands of bodies; the ground was soaked with their
blood and remains. Then he sat with the army to discuss the matter
and ask them what they had done. Every time a man came alMuthanna said to him: "Tell me what you did," and they told him and

33 Af-Tdreekh al-Islhi,

136

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Eme of 'Umar

gave him a picture of the battle. Al-Muthanna said: "The Arabs and
the Persians fought during the Jihiliyah and after Islam came. By
Allah, during the Jihiliyah, a hundred Persians were stronger than a
thousand Arabs, but today a hundred Arabs are stronger than a
thousand Persians. Allah has taken away their power and weakened
them, so do not be confused by their appearance or their great
numbers...,r34
This comment at this time was entirely appropriate, because alMuthanna explained his good experience in war with the Persians at a
time when many of the Muslims had come to Iraq to take part in war
against the Persians for the first time. Al-Muthanna compared what
they had seen in a particular battle with other battles that he had
fought before.35

1.4.2. Al-Muthanna's regret at cutting
the Persians' line of retreat
Al-Muthanna regretted cutting the Persians' line of retreat and
taking away the bridge from behind them. He said: "I made a
mistake, but Allah reduced its impact when I rushed to the bridge
ahead of them and cut it so as to comer them. I believe this was a
mistake, so do not do it and do not follow my example. It was a
mistake on my part; no one should be
Al-Muthanna
explained the reason for this mistake at the end of this speech, when
he noted, on the basis of his experience in warfare, that preventing the
enemy from fleeing makes them fight more fiercely in self-defence.
When a man realizes that he is going to be killed, he does his utmost
to defend himself. This cost the m y a great deal of effort as they

'Umar ibn al-Khaffrib

137

hied to finish off the enemy, hut Allah reduced the impact of this
mistake as al-Muthanna stated, as it helped the Muslim to remain
steadfast, so their power was greater than the enemy could hear.
Allah cast fear into the hearts of the enemy until they lost their ability
to resist and defend t h e m ~ e l v e s . ~ ~
Al-Muthanna's acknowledgment of this mistake, although he
was the man who achieved a great victory in this battle, is indicative
of strong faith and selflessness, for he put the interests of the group
before his own self-interests. This is the mark of a great man.38

1.4.3. Al-Muthanna's knowledge of military psychology
In addition to what we have mentioned of al-Muthanna's
genius, his brilliance included another depth which has to do with
war, which was his knowledge of military psychology and how to
deal with one's brothers in jihad. We see that a spirit of overwhelming
love tied al-Muthanna to those who were with him, which highlights
his emotional attitude towards them. This stands out in the way that
he spoke to them and the way they spoke of him. We see it when he
went around on his horse ash-Shumoos to each group in turn,
encouraging them and giving them instructions, and motivating them
to do their best, telling them, "By Allah, I like for myself this day
nothing other than what I like for all of you."39 And they responded
to him in like manner. The narrators say that no one could find fault
with him in word or deed.40 When he saw the Persian ranks
attacking, with their voices raised, he realized the effect that this
would have in hand-to-hand combat, especially when the memory of

Abu 'Ubayd's bridge was still ftesh in their minds. So he spoke
cunning words which helped them to remain steadfast and
counteracted the effect of that loud noise. He said, with amazing
calmness, "What you are hearing is a sign of failure. Keep quiet and
only speak in whispers."41
When his brother Mas'ood was s h c k a fatal blow, he spoke
words that deserve to be engraved in letters of gold: "0' Muslm, do
not worry about the fall of my brother, for this is how the best of you
No less great were the words spoken by his brother himself,
when he was offering his soul with the joy of martyrdom: "Raise
your flags, may Allah grant you victory. Do not wony about my
falling." When al-Muthanna stood to offer the funeral prayer for his
brother and some of the martyrs he said: "What consoles me is the
fact that they witnessed the battle of al-Buwayb; they went forward
and were steadfast; they were not scared and they did not retreat.
Indeed in martyrdom there is expiation for sins."43 Al-Muthanna
loved his troops and was compassionate towards them, and checked
on them ftequently. At the same time, he was strict and decisive,
adhering to what is known nowadays as military discipline.44When
he saw a man who was eager and pushing ahead, he said, "What is
the matter with him?" They said, "He is one of those who fled fiom
the battlefield on the day of the bridge, and now he is eager to fight."
He hit him with his spear and said, 'What's wrong with you? Stay
where you are, then when you see someone of your own caliber, then
take care of him,you do not have to kill yourself." He said, "I shall
do that," and he settled down and stayed in his rank.45 As alA$-Tareeq ila al-Madd'in, p. 446.

'Umar ibn al-Khanrfb

139

Muthanna was compassionate towards his troops, the feeling was
mutual. We see that clearly in the poetry which flowed kom the lips
of his soldiers. One of his troops composed imes of verse which
indicated that he clearly preferred al-Muthanna to Khilid ibn alWaleed and Abu 'Ubaydah ath-Thaqafi. The poet was kom the tribe
of 'Abd Qays, he was not kom Banu Shayb2n or Banu Bakr ibn
Wi'il, so that it might be said that he had a clannish attachment to his
own people.46
Al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah was a commander with a deep
knowledge of military psychology, centuries before any professor
wrote a single letter on this subject.47

1.4.4. The attitude of the womenfolk of the Mujlfhideen
One of the attitudes which should be noted is that of the
womenfolk of the Muslims, when the Muslim commander sent them
some of the food that they had acquired. He sent it with one of the
Christian Arab leaders, whose name was 'Amr ibn 'Abdul-Maseeh
ibn Buqaylah, with some of his men. When the women saw them,
they screamed thinking it was a raid, and they started to protect their
children by throwing stones and sticks at them. 'Amr ibn 'AbdulMaseeh said: "This is how you would expect the womenfolk of this
army to he," and he gave them the good news of the victory.48 This
attitude is indicative of a sound Muslim education and shows how a
Muslim character should be, even among women, for they must have
had some training in how to defend themselves when there were no
men around. This decisive victory gave the Muslims kee rein in Iraq
in the region between the two rivers. Al-Muthanna sent his leaders to

subdue other regions to Muslim rule, where they collected the booty
that Allah bestowed upon them so that they could continue the jihad
against their enemies.49

1.4.5. Pursuit of the fleeing remnants of the army
The joy of victory did not deflect al-Muthanna from his goal.
After the battle, he urged the people to follow the defeated army to
as-Sayyib. The Muslims set out after the fleeing remnants of the
army. Among them were some who had been present at the battle of
Abu 'Ubayd's bridge; they gathered a great deal of booty and raided
as far as-Sibit, then they turned back and joined al-Muthanna. The
importance of the battle of al-Buwayb lay not only in boosting
morale after the defeat at the bridge, but also in giving the Muslims
control over the entire region between the two rivers. They had been
fighting no further than the Euphrates, then they fought in the repon
between the Euphrates and the Tigris. After al-Buwayb they were in
full control of this region which extended between the Euphrates and
the Tigris. They could travel throughout the whole region without
fearing any
The battle of al-Buwayb was akin to the battle
of al-Ymook in ~ y r i a . ~ '

1.4.6. The Persian reaction
Events such as these could not happen without there being
some repercussions among the ruling circles of Persia. The Persian
leaders got together and spoke to Rustam and Fayrazk, saying:
"Why are you so divided that you have weakened the Persians and
encouraged their enemies? By Allah, nothing has brought this

weakness upon us but you, 0' commanders. You have divided the
people of Persia and distracted them fiom their enemies. After
Baghdad, Sgbiit and Takrit there is nothing left but al-Madi'in. By
Allah, you will unite, or we will start with you before anyone can
rejoice in our misfortune. By Allah, were it not that killing you may
lead to our own doom we would have hastened to kill you now. If
you do not give up (this division), we will kill you, then let us be
doomed after we have had the satisfaction of killing
Afier that, Rustam and Fayrazh went to B o o f i and said to
her: "Write to the wives and concubines of Chosroes and the wives
and concubines of the family of Chosroes for us." So she did that and
mote a letter for them. They sent word, asking them to come, and
they brought them all and handed them over to some men to torture
them and make them tell them of any male child of Chosroes. They
did not find any of them with these women, except that one of them
said that there was no one left except a boy called Yazdagird, who
was a son of Shahriyar the son of Chosroes; his mother was from the
people of Baduria. They sent people after her and caught her, and
demanded to know where he was. When the women were gathered
together, his paternal uncle Sheerawayh was in the white palace and
killed all the males of the family of Chosroes, seventeen brothers, so
that no one would compete for the throne of Persia. She had
smuggled him out and hidden him with his maternal uncles in
Istakhar. Among those whom Sheerawayh killed was his brother
Shahriyk the son of Chosroes Barweez fiom his favourite wife
Shireen. He was the father of this Yazdagird. They put pressure on
the mother of Yazdagird and she told them where he was. They sent
for him and brought him on the basis that he was the sole remaining
male of the family of S b h (the Sasanids), and they appointed him as
king. He was twenty-one years old, and they united around him and

142

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

all the Persians accepted him and competed in obeying him and
supporting him. They thought that this was a way out of their
dilemma.53Yazdagird I11 started to exercise his authority with the
help of Rustam and Fayrazh. They renewed the border posts of
Chosroes and appointed troops to each post and to al-Heerah, alAnb& and al- blah.'^

1.4.7. 'Umar's inshructions to al-Muthanna
News of the movements of Yazdagird III reached alMuthannq details of which were brought by his spies. He wrote to
'Umar, telling him of these events and of the expected counter-attack.
Al-Muthanna's prediction proved true, for the letter did not reach
'Umar before the people of the area between the two rivers turned
krifir, broke their treaty, and revolted against the Muslims. The
Persians hastened their attack and marched to fight when those ah1
adh-dhimmah revolted. When al-Muthanna saw that, he realized that
he had advanced too far and had occupied a greater area than his
forces could keep control of, so his occupation could not last. So he
withdrew with his guards until he reached Dhu Qik, and the people
stayed in one camp in at-Taff. 'Umar was more cautious, and his
letter reached them, saying: "Get out kom among the Persians and go
to the desert and scatter among the oases that are near the border with
the Persians, on the border between your land and their land. Do not
leave anyone of Rabee'ah or any of the fighters or horsemen of
Mu& and their allies without bringing them with you; if they come
willingly, all well and good, otherwise use force. Stay close to the
border between your land and theirs, until you receive further
instructions."55

throughout the oases, from one end of the Iraq desert to the other,
from Ghu* to al-Qatqagnah there were posts from which they could

and waiting for a new campaign. At the same time, the posts of
Chosroes were on alert and the Persians were ready, but they were
nervous and worried about a Muslim attack. The Muslims were eager
to fight but their commanders were holding them back, following
'Umar's instructions and waiting for reinforcements. That was at the
end of Dhu al-Qa'dah 13 A.H./January 635 c.E?~'Umar said: "By
AUah,I will send the kings of the Arabs to fight against the kings of
the Persians."
Then the first thing that he did was to write to his agents who
were in charge of the small towns and tribes. That was in Dhu alHijjah, at the time when the pilgrims were setting out for Hajj. The
fmt tribes whose routes led to Makkah and Madeenah came to him,
as did those who were on the road to Iraq, who were nearer to
Madeenah. They came to him in Madeenah on the way back from
Hajj and told him about those who were in Iraq. Those whose routes
were close to Iraq joined al-Muthanna. 'Umar did not leave any
leader, or any man of wisdom, noble position or power, or any
khageeb or poet, but he sent him against them. He sent the most
prominent of people against them?'

2. The Battle of al-Qgdisiyah
When 'Umar found out that the Persians were making
preparations and were gathering to eradicate the small number of
Muslim forces remaining in Iraq,he issued orders for compulsory
conscription, because the situation required that. Hence he
commanded al-Muthanna to look at the tribes around him and see
who was fit and able to fight and to bring them, willingly or
otherwise. This was the compulsory conscription which 'Umar
deemed essential, and he was the h t one to do that in Islam. This
shows that Muhammad Faraj, the author of al-'hkariyah alIslimiyah, was mistaken when he said that compulso~yconscription
first appeared at the time of the Umayyads. 'Umar issued the
command for compulsory conscription and his command was carried
out. No sooner had the caliph's letter reached al-Muthanna but he
started to implement the orders contained therein immediately,
according to the plan which 'Umar had drawn up for his movements.
'Umar sent word to his governors telling them not to leave anyone
who had a weapon, horse, physical strength or wisdom, but to send
them to him. He ordered them to recruit people by force and asked
them to send the new recmits to Iraq.59
The situation in Persia changed with the arrival of Yazdagird
ruler, and the situation of the Persians was as follows: There was
now internal stability as the result of Yazdagird's appointment and
the people's uniting aound him. The Persians felt reassured.and
confident, and their leaders competed in obeying and supporting him.
They announced a general conscription which included everyone
whom the Persians could recruit; they distributed groups of soldiers
throughout the land that had been conquered by the Muslims.

'Umar ibn al-Khattib

145

Finally they provoked the local population and incited them
against the Muslims, until they broke their treaty, renounced Muslim
protection and rebelled against them.60
The situation of the Muslims changed and became as follows:

Withdrawal
Al-Muthanna and the other leaders left, withdrawing ftom
among the Persians and leaving the lands they had conquered. They
withdrew and dispersed among the oases on the border between the
Arab and Persian lands. Al-Muthanna camped at Dhn Qk,and the
rest of the people camped in at-Taff. They set up posts in Iraq where
they could see one another and come to one another's aid if needed.
The compulsory conscription among the Muslims balanced
out the compulsory conscription among the ~ersians.~'

council to consult the Sahribah about what he was planning to do.
The call went out, a+Salrifu Jrimi'ah (prayer is about to begin), and
he sent for 'Ali, who came from Madeenah. Then he consulted them
and they all agreed that he should go to Iraq, except 'Abdur-Ralph
ibn 'Awf, who said to him: "I fear that if anything happens to you, the
Muslims will become weak in all regions of the land. I think that you
should send a man and return to Madeenah." 'Umar and the people
decided that Ibn 'Awf was right, and 'Umar asked: "Who do you
think I should send to Iraq?" He said, "You have already found him."
He then asked, "Who is he?" He said, "The lion in his den: Sa'd ibn
Maik az-Zubri (i.e., Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqks)." 'Umar liked the idea
and sent for Sa'd, whom he appointed as commander in Iraq.63

2.1.1. 'Urnx's

advice to Sa'd

When Sa'd (&) came to Madeenah, 'Umar appointed him as
commander of the war in Iraq, and said to him:"0' Sa'd, do not think
that you will be fme just because you are the matemal uncle of the
Messenger of Allah &) and the Companion of the Messenger of
Allah
Allah does not erase what is bad by something else that is
bad, rather He erases what is bad by something that is good. There is
no relationship between Allah and anyone except through obedience
to Him. The people, noble and ignoble alike, are aU equal before
Allah. Allah is their Lord and they are His slaves, and their criterion
for superiority is being sound. They attain what is with Him by means
of obedience. Look at the way of the Messenger of Allah &) from
the time he was sent until he left us, and adhere to it, for it is the
proper way. This is my advice to you. If you ignore it and turn away
from it, you will be one of the losers."64 This is eloquent advice from

'Umar ibn al-KhaM

147

a great and wise caliph. 'Umar understood the weak point that could
affect Sa'd, which is that he thought that he would be h e because of
which might make him feel
his close relationship to the Prophet
somewhat proud towards other Muslims. So 'Umar reminded him of
the general Islamic principle which is that the criterion of honour for
as Allah their Lord said, and they are His
a Muslim in this life
slaves - is being sound, and they can only attain what is with Him
by obeying Him. Being sound means being free of diseases of the
heart, as if he is saying that superiority is achieved by keeping away
from sin and by obeying Allah. This is the taqwa (piety, fear of Allah)
which Allah has made the criterion of honour, as He ( B )says:

a),

-

B... Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that [believer]
who has at-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)] ...)
(Qur'an 49: 13)

This is a just and merciful criterion, which every Muslim can attain if
he strives to seek the pleasure of Allah and happiness in the
Hereafter. Then at the end of this advice, 'Umar mentioned the
importance of adhering to the way of the Messenger of Allah @J,
which includes adhering to the religion as a whole and applying it to
the people.65

2.1.2. Other advice
Then the caliph 'Umar ihn al-Kha@h (&) advised Sa'd ibn
Abi Waqqis again, when he wanted to send him, saying: "I have
appointed you in charge of the war in Iraq, so heed my advice. You
are going to face something difficult, and nothing can save you h m
it except the truth. Accustom yourself and those who are with you to
doing good, start everything with good, and remember that for every
65 At-Tireekh

al-Islimi, 101362.

148

The Conquests of Iraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

good habit there is a means to develop it. The means of developlug
good is patience. If you are patient in bearing everything that befalls
you or happens to yon, you will gain fear of Allah. Remember that
fear of Allah is a combination of two things: obeying Him and
avoiding disobedience. Those who obey Him do so by hating this
world and loving the Hereafter, and those who disobey Him do so by
loving this world and hating the Hereafter. The signs of faith are
instilled by Allah in the heart; some are hidden and some are visible.
As for that which is visible, it is when the one who praises a person
and the one who criticizes him on the basis of truth are the same to
him. As for that which is hidden, it may be manifested in wisdom
flowing from his heart on his tongue and people's love for him. Do
not think little of how important it is for people to love you, for the
Prophets asked that people should love them. When Allah loves a
person He makes others love him too, and when He hates a person He
makes others hate him too. You should think of your status before
Allah by checking your status before the people who are with yon in
this cause."66
From this text we learn a number of things, including the following:
Adhenng to the truth saves the Muslim from difficulhes,
because the one who adheres to the truth is with Allah, and if a person
is with Allah, Allah will he with Him by His support and help. These
feelings will give the Muslim a strong motivation to double his
efforts and conkont difficulties and hardships, in addition to peace of
mind which is enjoyed by the one who adheres to the truth in word
and deed. That is in contrast to the one who deviates from the path of
truth, who feels anxious and suffers many kinds of pain, such as a
guilty conscience and the fear that people will find him out, as well as
the fear of unknown consequences of deviation.

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

149

'Umar stated that the means of attaining goodness is patience,
because the path of goodness is not paved with carpets, rather it is
rough and thorny, and travelling it requires a great deal of struggle
(jihad). So the one who wants to travel this road must equip himself
with patience, otherwise he will give up partway.
'Umar said that fear of Allah means obeying Him and
avoiding disobedience, then he explained the greatest motive that
will make a man obey Him, which is hatred of this world and love of
the HereaRer. The greatest motive that makes a man disobey Allah is
love of this world and hatred of the Hereafter.
Then he said that hearts have signs of faith, and he gave the example
of dealing with people on the basis of truth when one is angry and
when one is content. A man should not let people's praise make him

of him make him mistreat them or be unfair towards them.
'Umar stated that one of the hidden signs of faith in the heart is
wisdom that flows from the Muslim's heart on his tongue, and that he
is loved by his Muslim brothers. For Allah's love of His slave is
connected to the Muslims' love for him; when Allah loves a person
He makes him beloved to His slaves.67If Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqk, who
the Prophet @) had testified was one of the people of Paradise,
needed this advice, then how about us, who have so much less
understanding of Islam and are falling so far short in applying it?68

them to bid farewell from Sir& as far as a l - A ' w a ~ .Then
~ ~ he stood up
to address the people and said: "Allah sets similitudes for you, and
uses different figures of speech to revive your hearts, for hearts are
dead until Allah revives them. Whoever knows something, let him
benefit kom it, for there are signs and consequences of justice. Its
signs are modesty, generosity, gentleness and sofhness, and its
consequence is mercy. For every matter Allah has made a way of
dealing with it and a means of achieving it. The door to justice is
leaming lessons, and its key is asceticism. Leaming lessons means
remembering death by thinking about the dead and preparing for
death by sending on good deeds. Asceticism means taking dues fiom
everyone who owes them and giving them to everyone who is
entitled to them, without making any concession to anyone in that
and being content with what is sufficient of basic necessities, for if a
person is not content with the basic necessities, nothing will make
him feel independent of means. Allah has obliged me to deal with
supplications on His behalf, so bring your complaints to us. Whoever
cannot do that should bring them to one who will convey them to us,
and we will restore his rights without him having to do much."70

2.1.4. Sa'd's arrival in Iraq and
the death of al-Muthanna
Sa'd travelled with his army until he stopped in a place called
zarood7' in Najd. The caliph sent four thousand men as
reinforcements, and Sa'd was able to mobilize a further seven
thousand fiom Najd. Al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah ash-Shaybini was

waiting for him in Iraq with twelve thousand.
Sa'd stayed in Zarood, preparing for the decisive battle with
the Persians, and waiting for the command of the caliph 'Umar (&).
'Umar took a keen mterest in this battle and did not leave any
commander, wise man, nobleman, powerful person, orator or poet
hut he sent them against the Persians. He sent the most prominent and
powerful people against them.72 Whilst Sa'd and his army were
encamped in Zarood, al-Muthanna became gravely ill. The narrators
say that the wounds he had received on the day of the bridge
reopened and started bleeding, and he realized that the end was near.
As his pain grew intense, he appointed Basheer ihn al-Kha$+iyah to
be in charge of those who were with him after he died. Al-Muthanna
asked for his brother al-Mu'anna, and told him his last wishes, and
asked him to convey them to Sa'd. Then al-Muthanna surrendered his
soul to his Creator, and this sun that had filled the conquests of Iraq
wrth bright light finally set.73
In his final advice to Sa'd, he told him not to fight his enemy
and the enemy of the Muslims when they were mobilized to the
fullest extent in their own land; rather he should fight them on the
borders of their land, close to the land of the Arabs and close to
refuge fiom the land of the Persians. If Allah granted the Muslims
victory over the Persians, they would be able to capture all the land
that lay behind them, and if the outcome was otherwise, they would
be able to retreat and join the other Muslims. Then they would have
better knowledge of the routes and would feel more courageous in
their own land, until Allah turned things around in their favour.74

How similar were the last moments of al-Muthanna to the last

152

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Dme of 'Umar

moments of the caliph Abu Ba!a (&). Both of them left this world
when they were thinking of the Muslims and giving advice
concerning conquests. Abu Bakr died when he was advising 'Umar
and encouraging the people to conquer Iraq, and al-Muthanna died
when he was passing on the h i t s ofhis experience in war against the
Persians to the new leader of the war in Iraq, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq2~.
As he breathed his last, he was thinking, planning and giving advice
to ~ a ' d ? ~
When the advice and suggestions of al-Muthanna reached
Sa'd, he prayed for mercy for him, and issued instructions that alMu'anna ibn al-H2rithah be kept in his position, and that the
members of his household be taken care of.76It is worth noting that
al-Muthanna left instructions that his mfe, Salma bint Kha~fahatTaymiyah should many Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqLs; Sa'd proposed to her
after her 'iddahwas over and married her. Did al-Muthanna want to
be h d to his wife after he had passed away by letting her marry a
great hero, one of the heroes of Islam whom the Messenger of Allah
@J had testified as one of the people of Paradise? Or was rt that she
was intelligent and wise, and had knowledge of her husband's
experience in war, and he wanted to benefit the Muslims thereby?
Both are possible. This is a small example of the abundant &es of
that great generation.77

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

the following advice:

"I am ordering you and the troops who are with you to fear Allah in
all circumstances, for fear of Allah is the best weapon against the
enemy and the strongest weapon in war. I am commanding you and
those who are with you to be more careful in avoiding sin than in
avoiding your enemy, for the sins of the army are to be feared more
than their enemy. The Muslims are supported by their enemy's
disobedience towards Allah, were it not for that, we would not have
any strength, for our numbers are not like theirs and our weapons are
not like theirs. If we were equally matched in sin, they would have an
advantage over us in strength, and if we did not have an advantage
over them by our virtue, we would not be able to defeat them by our
strength. Remember that you have over you protectors from Allah
who know what you are doing, so feel shy before them and do not do
any act of disobedience towards Allah. You are (striving) for the sake
of Allah; do not say that our enemy is worse than us and will never
prevail over us even if will commit sin. A people may be defeated by
others who are worse than them, just as the Children of Israel were
defeated by the kiifir Magians when they did deeds that angered
Allah, and,

d... They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was
a promise [completely] fulfilled.#

( f i r 'an 17: 5)

Ask Allah for help against your evil whims and deslres just as you
ask Him for help against your enemies. I ask Allah for that, for us and
for you. Be kind to the Muslims on their march. Do not exhaust them
on their march, lest they reach their enemy weakened from their
journey, for they are marching towards an enemy that has not been
travelling, that has strong horses and nders. You and those who are
with you should rest for one day and night every week, so that they
will be able to regain their strength and lay down their weapons and

154

belongings. Do not camp near the towns of people who have a treaty
mth us or are under our protection, and do not let any of your
companions mteract with them except those whose religious
commitment you are confident of. Do not annoy any of the
townspeople at all, for they are protected and you are being tested
with regard to fulfilment of the treaty, just as they are bemg tested
with regard to their patience in adhering to it. So long as they are
keeping thex promise to you, keep your promise to them. Do not seek
victory against your enemies by oppressing those with whom you
have a treaty. When you reach the closest point of enemy land, spend
out spies, for none of their affairs should be hidden from you. You
should have with you Arabs and local people whom you trust and
who yon feel are smcere, for the news of a liar will be of no benefit to
you, even if he tells the truth sometmes. The dishonest one is a spy
against you, not for you. When you draw closer to the enemy's land
you should send out scouts and raiding parties to cut their supply
lines and Q to find out thex weak p o w . Choose people of wisdom
and strength among your companions for these missions, and choose
the best horses. Ifthey see the enemy the best way to deal with them
is by means of good advice from these people. Put the people of
jihad, patience and toughness in charge of these raiding parties, and
do not show favour to anyone on the basis of whims and desires,
because this may affect the whole affair and lead to bad
consequences. Do not send any scouts or raiding parties in a direction
in which you fear they may be exposed to danger. If you sight the
enemy, then bring back your scouts and troops. But do not hasten to
engage in fighting unless you are forced to, until you have had the
opportunity to find out their fatal weak points and have studied the
land until you know it as well as its people do. If any prisoner is
brought to you with whom you do not have a treaty, you should
execute him so as to strike fear into your enemies and the enemies of
Allah. Allah is the best disposer of affairs for you and those who are

with you; He is the One Who grants victory to you over your enemy,
and Allah is the One Whose help we seek."78
This great speech contains useful advice and shows us an important
aspect of 'Urnar's greatness, namely his great experience in military
planning. Divine help and guidance can clearly be seen in all his
commands and advice.79 We can sum up some of the important
principles included in this advice, as follows:

'3 Commanding the army to fear Allah and be dutiful to Him in all
situations. This is regarded as the primary weapon, and sin is
regarded as the primary enemy, after which comes the EJr
enemy.
*:* Drawing attention to the fact that there were angels keeping a
close and constant watch over the Islamic army, and pointing
out the importance of feeling too shy before them to commit
sin, because it makes no sense for a man to commit sin when
he is in the battlefield fighting in jihad for the sake of Allah.
O Affirming that it is quite incorrect to take the enemy's behaviour
as a standard to justify the behaviour of the Muslim army.

O Bearing in mind the constant need for Allah's help
The second principle which was aEirmed in 'Umar's letter to Sa'd is:
O Thinking constantly of Allah, emphasizing the sanctity of the
towns whose people have a peace treaty with the Muslims and
taking means to guarantee that their safety is not violated;
protecting the Muslim image fiom any bad reflection that
could affect the success of communication between Muslims
and non-Muslims, by punishing crooked behaviour on the part
of some Muslim individuals.

79 At-Tdreekh al-hidmi, 101374.

Pp. 119, 120.

156

The Conquests oflraq and the E a t at the Time of 'Umar

In an effort to achieve this principle, 'Umar ordered his
commander to pay attention to the means that could help to
keep the army's morale high and help it to reach the land of the
enemy still able to fight. He said: "Be kind to the Muslims
during their march... so that they will be able to regain their
strength and lay down their weapons and belongings." After
aflirming the importance of protecting and ensuring the safety
of the troops and weapons of the Muslim army, 'Umar pointed
out that prevention is better than cure, and that one of the most
important weapons of the army is to appear with proper
Islamic behaviour, in which words and deeds are in harmony.
As a precaution, 'Umar forbade the army to camp near the
towns of people with whom the Muslims had peace treaties, so
as to avoid the possibility of some transgression that could
negatively affect the relationships he wanted to establish, and
so as not to allow anyone except those who were trustworthy
to enter the towns, to ensure that the treaty would not be
violated and to oblige the people to adhere to it.
'Umar's letter also pointed to a third principle, which was:
*+: Using different methods of dealing with people, depending on
their relationship with the Muslims, and not burdening them
with more than they could bear. 'Umar asked his commander
not to oppress or mistreat the people with whom the Muslims
had treaties for the sake of seeking victory over those with
whom they were at war, and to seek the help of those whom he
trusted of the people in regions that were close to the regions of
conquest, on the basis that there should be some trust and
confidence, i.e., he should be careful not to give full trust and
not to go to extremes in trusting.

The fourth principle is gathering sufficient information about the
enemy:

'Umar ibn al-Khandb

* 'Umar drew attention to the

157

importance of relying on scouts fiom

the best elements of the army in gathering information, and
equipping them with the best weapons that the army possesses.
That is because the enemy may discover them and force them
to fight, so they should be strong and powerful so that they can
create the desired psychological impact on the enemy, making
them think that the army is strong and giving an impression of
using force.
The fifth and last principle mentioned in 'Umar's letter is appointing
the right man for the job:

$3The aim of gathering information about the enemy is not so much
for the purpose of fighting them as it is a precaution in case the
other side forces the Muslims to fight. Hence after taking the
means, the Muslims should refrain fiom fighting, but be
prepared for that if necessary, whilst taking the utmost
precautions.80

2.1.6. Seeking the help of former
apostates who had repented
During the Riddah wars and the conquests, Abu Bakr asSiddeeq (&) did not seek the help of any former apostate, but 'Umar
mobilized them after they repented and set their affairs straight, and
acquired some Islamic education, but he did not appoint any of them
to a position of authority?' According to one report, he said to Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqiis concerning Tulayw ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi and
'Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrib az-Zubaydi: "Seek their help, but do not
appoint them over one hundred (men)."82 What we learn fiom the

158

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

actions of the two caliphs Abu Bakr and 'umarS3 is that if a person
apostatizes from Islam then repents and comes back, his repentance is
accepted and his blood and wealth are protected; he has the same
rights and duties as all other Muslims, except that he is not to be
appointed to any position of authority over the Muslims' affairs,
especially in matters of leadership. That is because it is possible that
his repentance may be hypocritical, and if that is the case and he is
appointed to a position of authority and leadership, he will cause
great mischief in the land and upset the balance of life; he will bring
in others who are like him of the hypocrites and push away the
sincere believers, and the Islamic society will become a society that is
dominated by the characteristics of Jihiliyah. This wise policy of
these two Rightly-Guided Caliphs was aimed at protecting the
Muslim society from evildoers sneaking in to positions of leadership.
Perhaps the reason for this policy was also a means of making the
punishment go against what they (the former apostates) had bied to
achieve and of deterring anyone who might be tempted to rebel
against Islamic principles and seek a position of leadership by means
of opposing Islam and befriending the enemies of the faith.84

2.1.7. A letter from the caliph to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqgs
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& received a letter from 'Umar whilst he
was camping in ShirZ, on the border of Iraq, ordering him to march
towards Persia. In this letter it said: "March from S k i f towards
Persia, with the Muslims who are with you. Put your trust in Allah
and seek His help in all your affairs. Remember that you are going
towards a nation whose numbers are great and whose weapons are
superior; they are tough people in a forbidding land, which although

159

it is a plain will be difficult to conquer because there are many lakes,
runmng water and vast valleys. Unless you meet small groups of
them, if you encounter the people or some of them, then strike them
first. Beware of giving them time to wait for reinforcements after the
first confrontation. Do not be deceived, because they are cheaters and
deceivers. You have to take them very seriously and deal with them
in a decisive manner. When you reach a l - ~ i W s i ~ a hset
8 ~up
, posts at
the edge of al-Qidisiyah and let the people (i.e. the Muslims) be
between the wilderness and the inhabited land, on the plain between
the two. Then stay where you are and do not leave, for if they realize
that you are there, they will strike you with all their might, with their
cavalry and infantry. If you show patience in facing your enemy and
seek reward with Allah when fighting him, intending to do your duty,
then I have great hope that you will prevail over them. After that, they
will never again be able to assemble such a huge army, and if they do,
they will be in such a state of fear that they will lose courage. If the
outcome is otherwise, then you will have the wilderness behind you
and you can depart tiom the closest inhabited part of their land to the
closest uninhabited part of your land, where you will feel more
confident and have more knowledge of the land, and they will be
more fearful."
This advice concerning the choice of land where the army was
to settle is similar to the advice given by al-Muthanna to Sa'd. 'Umar
and al-Muthanna were agreed on the choice of land. Al-Muthanna's
advice was the result of more than three years experience of war
against the Persians. This is indicative of 'Umar's brilliance in
military planning, even though he had never set foot in Iraq. This
advice also urged the army to keep away from the enemy's reach
whilst sending raiding parties to harass them and incite their

85 Al-Qidisiyah was

160

The Conquests of Iraq and the East at the Eme of 'Umar

followers against them, until the Muslims could bring them to a place
of their own choosing for the major battle.86

2.1.8. Spiritual means of victory
according to 'Umar (&)
'Umar wrote to Sa'd, remmding him of the sp~ntualmeans of
victory, which were the most important. In his letter he said: "Pay a
great deal of attention to your heart (spiritual well-being). Talk to
your troops, exhort them and remind them of the importance of good
intentions and of checkmg on themselves. Patience, patience, fbr the
help of Allah comes in accordance with good intentions, and the
reward comes in accordance with how much one checks oneself. Be
careful as you are on this mission for His sake, ask Allah to keep you
safe and sound, and frequently repeat the words LB hawla wa 16
quwwata illa Bilkih -there is no power and no strength except with
Allah." Writepd tell me where you have reached with your army,
for my lack of knowledge of your situation and that of your enemy is
keeping me from writing some of the things I wanted to write.
Describe to us the routes of the Musllms and the land that lies
between you and al-Madz'iu, so that it is as if I can see it, and give me
a clear picture of your situation. Fear Allah and put your hope in Him,
and do not take anything for granted. Remember that Allah has made
a promise to you. Put your trust in Allah with regard to the mission
you are embarking on, and beware lest you be removed t?om this
position and replaced with someone else."87
In this letter, 'Umar advised Sa'd to pay attention to the heart
(spiritual well-being), for the heart is the engine of the body; if it is
sound the entire body will be sound. Then he advised him to exhort
86

At-Tdreekh al-Isldmi, 101379.
Trireekh a!-%baa, 41315.

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

161

his troops and remind them to be sincere towards Allah and to seek
reward with Him. He explained that the help of Allah is connected to
thaf and he wamed him against being negligent towards the
responsibility that he had undertaken and the conquests that lay
ahead. He reminded them of the importance of being connected to
Allah and that their strength was connected to His. He advised the
Muslim commander to tread a path between fear of Allah and hope
for that which is with Him. This is an important attitude which
reflects a deep understanding of Tawheed. He told him not to take
anythiig for granted because of some righteous deed that he did or
because some people praised him. And he reminded him that Allah
had promised victory to the Muslims and the destruction of kufr. He
warned him against being negligent concerning any means of victory,
for victory might not be granted to him, rather it might be granted to
others whom Allah chose."

2.1.9. Sa'd's description of the location of
al-Qsdisiyah to 'Umar and 'Umar's response
Sa'd wrote to 'Umar (&) describing to him the land where he
expected the decisive battle to take place. He said: "All of those who
have entered into peace treaties with the Muslims in the land between
the two rivers are supportmg the Persians. They have submitted to
them and are preparing to fight us. The one whom they have chosen
to fight us is Rustam, among others like him. They are trying to
annoy us and make us engage in skirmishes, and we are trying to
annoy them and provoke them. The decree of Allah will inevitably
come to pass and His will is to be submitted to, whether it is in our
favour or not. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound."89

162

The Conquests of Iraq and the East at the lime of 'Umar

'Umar wrote to him, saying: "I have received and understood
your letter. Stay where you are until Allah brings your enemy to you,
and remember that this coni?ontation is going to be decisive. If Allah
enables you to defeat them, do not stop there, carry on until you
conquer a l - M d i n , for it will be destroyed if Allah wills."90
-

-

From 'Umar's letter it is clear that he had taken the right
decision, which was that Sa'd should stay put and not leave his
position. He should not hasten to fight the enemy, rather he should
leave it to the enemy to initiate the fighting. He should invest his
victory by pursuing the enemy to a l - M d i n and conquering it?l At
the same time he should take the material means necessary to
achieving victory.
'Umar did not ignore the spiritual aspects of the matter. He
launched a psychological war against the enemy in their own land,
the seat of their rule and power. He sent word to Sa'd saying: "I have
a strong feelimg that when yon meet the enemy you will defeat them.
Then if any one of you makes a gesture or speaks a word of safety (to
one of the Persians) then this man should be granted security, because
even if it is done by mistake, fulfilling the promise is a means of
achieving victory and breaking a promise, even if it is done by
mistake, is a means that leads to defeat, which will weaken you and
strengthen your enemy."9z
It is as if 'Umar was living with the Muslim army with all his
senses. He became so worried that he could not enjoy life or relax
until he had heard news of them. In such cases inspiration &omAllah
was a means of reducing the great burden that 'Umar had undertaken,
and a means of making the Muslims steadfast and strengthening their

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

163

hearts. We see that 'Umar reminded the Muslims of some of the
spiritual means by urging them to adhere to the word of honour, to be
truthful in speech and to fulfil promises, even if that was granted by
an individual Muslim, or if there had been a misunderstanding and
the Muslim did not intend to grant security but the enemy understood
it as such.93

2.2. 'Umar asked Sa'd to send a delegation
to debate with the Persian king
'Umar said to Sa'd in his letters: "Do not feel distressed by
what you hear about them and what they come up with. Seek the help
of Allah and put your trust in H i . Send to him some men of wisdom
and courage to call them to Allah."'Umar asked Sa'd to write to him
every day94.Sa'd started to gather some men of wisdom and courage.
Those whom he chose were men of understanding and wisdom:
1. An-Nu'mh ibn Mnqrin al-Muzani
2. Bisr ibn Abi Rahm al-Juhani

3. Hamlah ibn Juwayh al-Kinhi

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

'Umar chose a group who were dignified and good-looking,
and who had deep insight:
1. ' A w d ibn Hiijib at-Tameemi
2. Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays al-Kindi
3. Al-Hkith ibn Hassk a&-Dhuhali

6. Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah ath-Thaqafi

These were fourteen d i ' i y a h whom Sa'd sent to call the king of
Persia to Islam, acting on the orders of 'Umar (&). They were
leaders of their people, as 'Umar (&) wanted, who would be able to
call Yazdagird with wisdom and beautiful preaching, in a way that is
best, in the hope that Allah might guide him and his troops to Islam
and thus avoid bloodshed on both sides. This carefully selected
delegation was of a high caliber and able for the task for which they
had been appointed. In addition to the qualities that they enjoyed of
good looks, dignity and wisdom, they also had previous knowledge
of the Persians. Some of them had fought them, defeated them and
engaged in battles with them in previous campaigns, some of them
had gone in delegations to the Persian kings during the Jihiliyah, and
some of them know the Persian language. It is as if Sa'd chose them
for this delegation after they had passed a kind of test to prove that
they were qualified for the mission, as well as a kind of physical
exam to determine their strengths and weaknesses, and their level of
fitness and good looks.97

165

This blessed delegation, led by an-Nu'm2n ibn Muqrin,
reached al-Madi'in and entered to meet the Persian king Yazdagird,
who asked them, through his translator: "What brought you here?
What motivated you to invade us and penetrate so deeply into our
land? Is it because we were hstracted from you that you were
encouraged to attack us?" An-Nu'& ibn Muqnn spoke on thelr
behalf, and said: "Allah had mercy on us and sent to us a Messenger
who commanded us to do good and forbade us to do evil, and
promised us, if we responded, the good of this world and the
Hereafter. There was no tribe but some of them responded and others
did not. Then he commanded us to start with those of the Arabs who
opposed him, so we started with them, and they either jomed him
unwillingly then became happy that they had joined him, or they
joined him willingly and were blessed. We all recognized the
superiority of what he brought over what we had been livmg with of
enmity and hardship. Then he commanded us to start with the nations
that were closest to us, and we called them to justice. We are calling
you to our religion, which is a religion that recognizes what is good
and confms it as such, and recognizes what is evil and c o n k s it as
such. If you refuse, then you may choose one of the bad options
rather than the worst option:j j a h , but if you refuse, then fighting. If
you respond to our religion, we will leave with you the Book of
Allah, on condition that you rule by its rulings, and we will leave you
and let you run your affam in your land. If you pay thejizyah we will
accept it from you and leave you to run your own affairs. If you pay
the jizyah we will accept it from you and will protect you, otherwise
we will fight you."
The Persian king Yazdagird said: "I do not lcnow of any nation
on earth that was more miserable and fewer in number and more
divided than you. We used to delegate some of the tribes on the
border to take care of you. You never hoped to stand up to Persia. If
you think you can defeat us, that is folly on your part. If you are going

through hardship, we will give you some food until things get easier,
and we will honour your leaders and clothe you, and we will appoint
a king to he kind to you."
Al-Mugheerah ihn Z h h stood up and said: "As for what
you have said about our had situation, that is true and it was even
worse than that," and he mentioned the miserable life of the Arabs
and how Allah had showed mercy to them by sending the Prophet
0,as an-Nu'& had said. Then he said: "Choose, either pay the
jizyah with willing submission, and feel yourselves subdued (cf.
Qur'an 9: 29) or fight, or else save yourselves by becoming Musliis."
Yazdagird said: "Were it not that envoys are not to he killed, I
would have killed you. I have nothing for you." Then he ordered that
a load of dust be brought and he told his people: "Put this on their
nobles, and drive them out of al-Md'in." '&im ihn 'Amr stood up
and said: "I am the noblest of them," and he took the dust and went
out to his mount and rode off. m e n he reached Said he said to him,
"Be of good cheer, for by Allah, Allah has given us the keys to their
kingdom."98 Then Rustam came out with his huge army, one
hundred thousand strong or more, ftom Sibit. When he passed by
Kootha -a town between al-M&in and Bibil -he met an Arah
man. Rustam asked him: "What brought you here? What do you want
ftom us?" He said, "We have come seeking the promise of AUah, that
we will take possession of your land and sons if you refuse to
submit." Rustam said, "Then we are placed under your control." The
Arab said, "Your deeds let you down, so Allah put you under our
control. Do not be deceived by what you see around you, for you are
not conffonting people, rather you are confronting the divine
decree!" Rustam got angty with him and killed him. When his m y
passed al-Baras - a town between al-Koofah and al-Hillah, they

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

seized its people and its wealth, and drank wine, and raped the
women. The people of al-Baras complained to Rustam and he said to
his people: "By Allah, that Arab spoke the truth. By Allah, nothing
let us down but our own deeds. By Allah, even though they are in a
state of war, the Arabs treated these people better than you are
treating them."99
When Sa'd, the commander of the Muslim army, got news of
Rustam, he sent 'Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrib az-Zubaydi and Tnlayhah
ibn Khuwaylid, along with ten other men, to find out about the army.
They had not gone very far when they saw the enemy camp spread
out along the banks of the river. They all went back apart fiom
Tulayhah, who continued until he had penetrated deeply among the
enemy and gathered more information. Then he went back to Sa'd
and told him what he had f o n d out. This Tulayhah had been one of
the leaders of the apostates, but 'Umar allowed the Arabs who had
apostatized and then repented to join the jihad, whereas Abu Bakr
had not allowed that. But 'Umar did not allow those former leaden of
apostasy who went out forjlhad aRer having repented to be appointed
to positions of leadership. He was keen for them to be disciplined and
to learn the meanings of faith and piety, and he gave them valuable
opportunities to express the sincerity of their faith and piety.
Tnlayhah al-Asadi and 'Amr az-Zubaydi played an important role in
the wars in Iraq and Persia.

2.3. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq2~sent
delegations to call Rustam to Islam
Rustam travelled with his army fiom al-Heed until he
reached al-Qidisiyah at the bridge called al-'Ateeq, facing the
99 Ibnlim

168

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the lTme of 'Umar

Muslim camp, with the river in between them. The Persians had
thirty-three elephants with them. When they camped, he sent word to
Sa'd saying, "Send us a man with whom we may speak." He sent
Rab'i ibn 'h,
who came to him and found him sitting on a throne
of gold, with carpets and cushions interwoven with gold thread.
Rab'i came riding his horse, with his sword in a sheath of cloth and
his spear tied around with cloth. When he reached the carpets, he
made his horse step over them, then he dismounted and tied his horse
with two pillows that he tore apart. Then he took the saddlecloth and
wrapped it around himself (like a cloak). They gestured to him that he
should put down his weapon. He said, "If I had come to you on my
own initiative, I would do what you ask, but you are the ones who
called me." Then he came, leaning on his spear and taking small
steps so as to do more damage to the carpet on which he was walking.
When he came near to Rustam, he sat on the ground and stuck his
spear into the carpet, and said, "We do not sit on your furniture."
Rustam asked him: 'What brought you here?" He said, "AUah
brought ns here. He has sent us to bring whomsoever He wills from
the worship of other people to the worship of Allah, from the
constriction of this world to its ease, and from the injustice of other
religions to the justice of Islam. He sent to us His Messenger,
bringing His religion to His creation. Whoever accepts it, we will
accept that and leave him and his land alone, but whoever refuses, we
will fight him until we end up either in Paradise or in victory."100
Rustam said: "We have heard what you said. Can you give us
some time to think about it?" He said, 'Yes, one of the things that the
Messenger of Allah
taught us is not to give the enemies more
than three days. So we will leave you alone for three days. T h i i
about it and choose one of three options: either become Muslim, and

a)

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

169

we will leave you and your land alone; or pay the jizyah and we will
accept it and leave you alone, and if you need us we will come to
your help; or figbt on the fourth day, unless you start it before then. I
guarantee that to you on behalf of my companions." Rustam asked,
"Are you their leader?" He said, "No, but the Muslims are like a
single body, part of one another, and the highest of them accepts a
commitment made by the lowest of them."
Then he went away, and Rustam consulted with his
companions and said, "Have you ever heard anything like what tbis
man has said?" They tried to make little of him, but Rustam said:
"Woe to you, I am thinking of his wisdom, eloquence and behaviour.
The Arabs do not care about clothes but they pay a great deal of
attention to lineage."

On the second day, he sent word to Sa'd asking him, "Send
this man to us again." But he sent Hudhayfah ibn Mihsan alGhalEni, who did not say or do anything different than Rab'i had,
and no wonder, for they were cast from the same mould, namely the
religion of Islam. Rnstam said to kim:"Why didn't the first one come
to us?" He said, "Our commander treats us equally in times of
hardship and times of ease, and today it is my turn." Rustam said,
"How long do we have?" He said, "Three days, starting kom
yesterday."
On the third day, he sent word to Sa'd saying, "Send us a
man." So he sent al-Mugheemh ibn Shu'bah to him. He went to him
and sat with bim on his throne, but the courtiers rushed to him and
pulled him away. He said to them, "We used to hear a great deal about
your wisdom, but I have never seen any people more foolish than
you. We Arabs do not enslave one another. We thought that you
treated one another equally as we do. I wish that you had told me that
some of you act like the masters of others. You cannot continue like
this, for a kingdom based on such an attitude cannot last." The

i

common folk said, "The Arab is speaking the h t h , by Allah." The
chieftains - the leaders of the peasants - said: "This is the kind of
idea that our slaves are longing to hear. May Allah curse our
predecessors, for they kept making little of this nation." Then
Rustam spoke in a belittkg manner of the Arabs, and exaggerated
about the Persians, mentioning the miserable and diEcult lives that
they (the Arabs) led."'
Al-Mugheerah said: "As for what you have said about our
miserable situation and division, we admit it and do not deny it. But
things in this world do not last forever, and after hardship comes ease.
If yon did give thanks for what Allah has given you, your gratitude
was too little in comparison to what you were given. Your lack of
gratitude led to the decline in your situation. Allah sent among us a
Messenger", then he said something similar to what the others had
said, and he concluded by giving them the choice between acceptmg
Islam, paying the jizyah or fighting.'''
Rustam consulted with the Persians and said, "Who are they in
comparison to yon? The first two came and boldly figured you out,
then this one came with the same approach. They have all followed
the same method and acted in the same way. By Allah, these are real
men whetherthey are sincere or are liars. By Allah, if their discipline
and their way of keeping secrets has reached such a level that they all
have the same approach, never differing, there are no people who are
able to achieve what they want like them. If they are sincere, no one
will be able to stand up to them." Then the people started shouting
and arguing.

2.4. Preparation for battle
The Persians were not convinced by this call, and they got
carried away in their stubbornness that Allah might accomplish a
matter already ordained (cf. Qur'an 8: 42). The Persians gathered to
fight, and the Muslims prepared themselves for that. The Persians
crossed the river at al-'Ateeq, and Rustam drew up his huge army in
the following order:
+:* At the core: Dhu al-Hijib, with eighteen elephants carrying boxes
and men

To the right of the core: al-J&us
*:* On the right flank: al-Hormuzin, with seven or eight elephants

carrying boxes and men
*:* To the left of the core: al-Beerazin
'0

On the left flank: Mahrih, with seven or eight elephants carrying
boxes and men

Rustam sent a detachment of cavalry to the bridge to prevent
the Muslim from crossing over towards his army, so the bridge was
between two cavalries, that of the Muslims and that of the
mushrikeen. The ranks were drawn up as follows:
The cavalry in the first rank, followed by the elephants, then
the infantry. A huge canopy was set up for Rustam, beneath which he
was shaded on his throne, where he sat watchmg the progress of the
battle.'03 The Muslims were fully prepared to fight. Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqq& had prepared his army early on, appointing commanders and
leaders. He appointed men who were known for their virtue to cany
the banners, and he organized the vanguard, rearguard and two

172

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Zme of 'Umar

flanks, as well as the scouts. He had reached al-Qidisiyah in a state of
readiness. He organized his army in the following manner:
+*: In the vanguard: Zuhrah ibn al-Hawiyah

3 On the right flank: 'Abdullih ibn al-Mu'tamm
+:* On the left flank: Shurahbeel ibn as-Sam! al-Kindi, with Khilid
ibn 'Urfutah as his deputy
+*: In the rearguard: 'ASim ibn 'Amr
0:.

In charge of the scouts: Sawid ibn M i l k

+
*: In charge of the cavahy: Salmin ibn Rabee'ah al-Bihili
* In charge of the infanby: Hammil ibu M i l k al-Asadi

O In charge of the riders: 'Abdulliih ibn Dhi as-Sahamayn al-Hanafi

6 To judge between them: 'Abdur-Rw&I ibn Rabee'ah al-Bihili
*:* The scribe of the army: Ziyid ibn Abi Sufiyk

O At the head of the army as their spokesman: Salmin al-Fiixisi. All
of this was done on 'Umar's instru~tions.'~
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@ addressed the people and recited the
following verse:
(And indeed We have written in az-Zaboor [i.e. all the revealed Holy
Books -the Tawrit (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Psalms and the
Qur'an] after [We have already written in] al-Lawh al-Mahfoo& [the
Book that is in the heaven with AUah] that My righteous slaves shall
inherit the land.)
(@r 'an 21. 105)
He ordered the readers to start reciting Soorah al-Anfil, which they
did. The people were deeply moved and a sense of tranquillity

I

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

173

descended upon them. The people prayed B u h r , then Sa'd ordered
his army to advance after the fourth takbeer, and to say, "La^hawla
wa la quwwata illa Billdh -there is no power and no strength except
with Allah."
The battle lasted for four days. Sa'd was ill with sciatica and
abscesses that made him unable to ride or sit, so he lay on his chest on
a pillow, looking out over the battlefield from the fort of Qudays
which was in al-Qidisiyah. He had delegated Kh2lid ibn ' U r f n a to
convey his orders to the people, and he ordered that it be called out to
the army: "Envy is not allowed except in jihad for the sake of Allah,
0' people, so envy one another in jihad."lo5
Before the fighting began, there was a dispute about Khilid
ibn 'Uh@h, the deputy of Sa'd. Sa'd said: "Carry me and put me
where I can see the people." So they lifted him up, and he lay looking
out over them, with the ranks at the bottom of the wall of the fort of
Qudays. He gave instructions to Khilid, and Kh%d gave instmction
to the people. He was one of those for whom some of the prominent
people had tried to cause trouble, so Sa'd punished them and rebuked
them. He said: "By Allah, were it not that your enemy is there, I
would have made an example of you." He detained them, including
Abu Mihjan ath-Thaqafi, and chained them up in the fort. Jareer ibn
'Abdull% said, confirming the importance of obeying one's leader,
"As for me, I gave my oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah
&), pledging to hear and obey whomever Allah put in charge, even
if he was an Abyssinian slave." Sa'd said: "By AUah, if anyone
causes similar trouble after this, distracting the Muslims from their
enemies when they are in front of them, I will set a precedent in
punishing him."lo6

After this incident, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis stood up and
addressed them. After praising and glorifying Allah, he said: "Allah
is the Truth and has no partner or associate in His Dominion, and His
says: 4And indeed We have
promise is never broken. Allah
written in uz-Zaboor [i.e. all the revealed Holy Books t h e TawrBt
(Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Psalms, the Qur'an] after [We have
already written in] al-Lawh al-Mahfoog [the Book that is in the
heaven with Allah] that My righteous slaves shall inherit the land.)
(Qurhn 21: 105) This is your inheritance which your Lord has
promised you. Allah put this land under your control tbree years ago
and your have been eating of its food until today, as a result of the
efforts of those who fought before you. Now this gathering of them
has come to you, but you are the leaders of the Arabs and the best of
each tribe, the pride of those who are behind you. If you show
disinterest in worldly gains and hope for the Hereafter, Allah will
bless you with reward in this world and in the Hereafter. This jihad is
not going to bring anyone closer to his appointed time of death. If
you fail and grow weak, you will lose out in this world and will be
doomed in the o ere after."'^'

(a)

Sa'd wrote to those who were canying the banners: "I have
appointed Khilid ibn 'Urfu@h in charge of you. Nothing is
preventing me from being in his place hut the pain which keeps
bothen'ng me and the abscesses I have. I am lying on my front where
I can see you, so listen to him and obey him, for he is passing on my
instructions and following my commands." This letter was read to
the people, and they were content with it and accepted his opinion,
encouraging one another to hear and obey. They accepted Sa'd's
excuse and agreed with his actions.108Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqb remained
at the top of the fort, looking out over the battlefield. The fort was not

'Umar ibn al-Khngib

175

fortified, and this is indicative of the courage of Sa'd (4).
It was
narrated that 'Uthmh ibn Raj? as-Sa'di said: "Sa'd ibn M i l k was
the bravest and most daring of people, for he stayed in a fort that was
not fortified in order to observe the two armies, looking out over the
people. If the Muslims had retreated even a little, the fort would have
been exposed and the enemy could have captured it. But by Allah, he
never got worried or scared during the terror of those days."'0g

Rustam became newous when he heard the adEn
When Rustam stopped at an-Najaf, he sent a spy to the Muslim
camp, who managed to penetrate their ranks at al-Qusiyah. He saw
them using the miswak at the time of every prayer, then praying, aRer
which they would separate and go back to their places. He went back
to Rustam and told him about them and their behaviour. Rustam
asked him:'What do they eat?" He said, "I stayed among them for a
night, and by Allah I did not see any one of them eating anything,
apart from some sticks that they sucked on in the evening, when they
slept and in the early morning." When he moved on, he camped
" ~ he came close to them, the
between al-Hqn and a l - ' ~ t e e ~ .When
muhdh-dhin of Sa'd was giving the call for Fajr prayer, and he saw
them preparing to get up. He called out to the Persians, telling them to
ride. He was asked why, and he said, "Do you not see that a call was
given to your enemy and they are getting ready for you?" That spy of
his said, 'Wo, they are getting ready to pray."111
When they crossed the river and stopped, the mu'adh-dhin of
Sa'd was giving the call for B u h r prayer. Sa'd prayed, and Rustam
said: " 'Umar is killing me."112

Raising morale among the Muslim ranks
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqh gathered the leaders and commanders of
the Muslims at the beginning of the k t day of the battle and said to
them: "Go and speak to the people as you should at times of war,
because you hold a prominent position among the Arabs, and you are
the poets and orators of the Arabs, people of wisdom and leaders."
So they went around among the people, reminding them and
exhorting them to fight.ll3
*:* Qays ibn Hubayrah al-Asadi said: "0' people, praise Allah for
what He has guided you to and for His blessing, and that will
increase. Remember the blessings of Allah and beseech Him.
For Paradise or booty lie before you. There is nothing but
wilderness and barren land beyond this fort, a vast and mgged
land that cannot be crossed."
*:* Ghilib ibn 'Abdulliih al-Laythi said: "0' people, praise Allah for
His blessing and ask Him for more. Call on Him and He will
respond. 0' people of Mu'add, what will your response be
today when you have with you your horses and swords? Think
of what people will say of you tomorrow, for you will be at the
forefi-ont tomorrow."

believed in His Prophet and Messengers. Do not die except as
Muslims. Nothing should be less significant in your eyes than
worldly gain, for worldly gain comes to those who think little
of it. Do not incline towards it, for it will run away from you

and mislead you. Support (the cause of) Allah and He will
support YOU."
+3'ASim ibn 'Amr said: "0' Arabs, you are the leaders of the Arabs
and you are confronting the leaders of the Persians. What is at
stake is nothing less than Paradise. They should not be more
eager for this world than you are for Paradise."

*: Rabee' ibn al-Bilid as-Sa'di said: "0' Arabs, fight for your faith
and for worldly gain. BAnd march forth in the way [which
leads to] forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise a s wide
as the heavens and the earth, prepared for al-Muttaqoon [the
pious, righteous].) (Qur'an 3: 133)""~

$3 Rab'i ibn 'h
said: "Allah has guided you to Islam and has
united you therein and shown you victory. In patience there is
comfort, so accustom yourselves to patience and you will get
used to it. Do not accustom yourselves to panic and let it
become a habit."
And all of them spoke similar words.'I5

2.4.1. The day of Armzth
The day of Armith dawned on the fmt day of al-Qasiyah.
Sa'd gave his instructions to the m y , saying: "Stay where you are
and do not move until you have prayed B u h r . When you have
prayed B u h r , I will say takbeer, so say takbeer and get ready.
Remember that takbeer was not given to anyone before you, and it
was only given to you as a support for you. Then when you hear the
second takbeer, say takbeer, and be ready. When I say the third
takbeer, say takbeer and let your horsemen go forth against the

178

enemy. When I say the fourth takbeer, then all march forth until you
meet your enemy, and say La^ hawla wa 16 quwwata illa Billrih there is no power and no strength except with ~ l l a h . " " ~
When Sa'd had prayed E u h r , he ordered the slave whom
'Umar had told to stay with him, who was well versed in Qur'an, to
recite the Soorah of jihad (i.e., Soorah al-Anfil). He recited the
Soorah of jihad to the squadron that was closest to him, and it was
recited to every other squadron too. It raised the people's morale and
they were filled with tranquillity when it was recited to them."'
When the readers had finished, Sa'd said takbeer, and those who
were around him said takbeer in response to his takbeer, and the
people said takbeer in response to one another's takbeers, and the
people moved forward. Then he said the second takbeer and the
people got ready. Then he said the third takbeer and some horsemen
went forward to fight. Men of similar rank from among the Persians
came out to meet them and they exchanged

champions, such as Gh2lih ibn 'Abdull2h al-Asadi, 'Asim ibn 'Amr
at-Tarneemi, 'Amr ibn Ma'di Karib az-Zubaydi, and Tulayw ibn
Khuwaylid al-Asadi, had a great impact, dealing a heavy blow to the
enemy by killing some and capturing some of the enemy's
champions, whereas none of the Muslims were killed during the
single combat. Single combat is one of the most difficult arts of war,
which only a few champions among men do well. It boosts the
morale of the victors and increases their courage, and it demoralizes
the losers and makes them lose heart. The early Muslims excelled in
this art and were always superior to others, hence they were the ones
who benefited h m it."' Whilst the people were waiting for the

fourth takbeer, the infantry leader of Banu Nahd, Qays ibn Hudhaym
ibn Jarthoomah, stood up and said: "0' Banu Nahd, msh upon the
enemy (inhadu). You are called Nahd so act upon your name."
Khilid ibn 'Urfu* sent word to him saying, "By Allah, conbol
yourself, or I shall appoint someone else instead of you." Then he
calmed down.1z0

Rustam orders some of his troops to attack
When Rustam saw that the Musluns were superior in single
combat and in driving off their enenues, he did not wait until the plan
of their leader for more single combat was completed. Rather he
ordered some of his troops to launch a general attack on the division
of the Muslim army that was composed of Banu Bajeelah and those
who were with them. This attack was something strange, because the
Persians directed nearly half of their army agamst a section that
represented only a small part of the Muslim army. This indicates that
they were desperate to put a stop to the smgle combat in which they
had failed. Thus the Persians attacked one flank of the Muslim army
wth thirteen elephants, each of which was accompanied, according
to the Persian military system, by four thousand waniors, including
both foot soldiers and horsemen. The elephants scattered among the
Muslim squadrons,but the attack focused on Bajeelah and those who
were with them. The foot soldiers, who were known for their
courage, stood firm against the Persian attack.

Sa'd commands Asad to go to the aid of Bajeelah
Sa'd saw what was happening to Bajeelah, so he sent word to
Banu Asad, tellmg them: "Go to the aid of Bajeelah and the people
who are with them." Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid, Hafnmil ibn M S k ,
GhUib ibn 'Abdullih and ar-Ribayyil ibn 'Amr set out, with their

180

The Conquests oflraq and the Easf at fhe l?me of 'Umar

squadrons. Al-Ma'roor ibn Suwayd and Shaqeeq said: "By Allah,
they charged at them, and kept stabbing and striking until we
managed to get the elephants away from them. Then a powerful man
of theirs came out and engaged Tulayhah in single combat, but
Tulayhah soon killed him. When the Persians saw what the squadron
of Asad was doing to their elephants, they launched a heavy attack
against the Muslims. Dhu al-H2jib and al-Jalinus, two of the Persian
leaders, launched a coordinated attack on the Muslim, whilst the
Muslims were still waiting for the fomth takbeer from Sa'd. The
Persian forces gathered around Asad, along with those elephants, but
Asad stood tinn. Sa'd said the fourth takbeer, then the Muslims
moved forward towards them, whilst the attack on Asad continued
and the elephants moved against the Muslims' horses from the right
and the left. The horses were terrified by the elephants, so the
horsemen asked the foot soldiers to push their horses forward
towards the elephants.

Sa'd tells Banu Tameern to tackle the elephants
Sa'd sent word to '&im ibn 'Amr at-Tarneemi, saying: "0'
Tameem, are you not keepers of camels and horses? Do you not have
a way to deal with these elephants?" They said, "Yes, by Allah."
Then he called some of his people who were archers, and others who
were skilful and agile, and said to them, "0' archers, target the riders
of the elephants with your arrows." And he said, "0' skilful and agile
ones, go around the back of the elephants and cut the ropes so that the
boxes which cany the fighters will fall. The fighting was focused on
Asad, but there was fighting in the right and left flanks too. The
companions of 'Asim went to the elephants and took hold of their
tails and the ropes; they cut the ropes and the elephants started
trumpeting. There was no elephant left that day but the boxes were
thrown off and the fighters that were in them were killed. Fighting
broke out everywhere, thus relieving the pressure on Asad and

'Umar ibn al-Kkatfrib

181

pushmg the Persians back from them. The fighting continued until
sunset and into the early part of the night, then both sides fell back.
That day there were five hundred casualties among Asad, who
had been in the fiont of the army. '&im and Banu Tameem had been
shielding the people. That was the first day, which was known as the
day of ~ r m i i t h . ' ~ ~

The heroic attitude of Tulay&h ibn Khuwaylid
The command of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqg~had an effect on Banu
Asad. On that day, Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid said: "0' my tribe, our
leader has great faith in you. If he knew that there was anyone who
was more able to go to the aid of these people he would have sent
them. Charge at the enemy, go at them like fierce lions. You are called
Asad ("lion") so be as fierce as lions and never flee or turn back. Go
forward and do not retreat. What a good job Rabee'ah is doing.
Charge at them in the name of ~ l l a h . " ' ~ ~
These words had an amazing effect on his people, motivating
and energizing them. They were on their own in the battlefield until
Banu Tameem came to their aid, and they sent forth that day five
hundred
The tribes were impressed by the heroic courage of Banu
Asad, and al-Ash'ath ibn Qays al-Kindi said: "0;Kindah, what a
good job Banu Asad are doing." So Kindah moved £tom the
defensive to the offensive, and drove back the Persians who were in
front of thern.lz4

The Conquests ofIraq and the E a t at the lEme of 'Umar

The field hospital
The field hospital was located in alL'Udhayb, where the
womenfok of the Mujdhideen were staying, waiting patiently and
seeking reward with Allah. They received the wounded and treated
them until the decree of Allah concerning them was fulflled. In
,addition to that, they had another mission in which the children
helped them, namely digging the graves of the martyrs. Treating and
nursing the wounded is in tune with women's aptitudes, whereas
digging graves is a tough job, but the men were busy fighting in
jihad, so the women bad to do their job out of necessity. They were
qualified to do so because of their faith and patience.'z5 The m-s
were moved to the valley of Musharrif, which is between al-'Udhayb
and 'Ayn ash- hams."^ The cessation of fighting between the
Muslims and their enemies that night gave some of the Mujihideen
the opportunity to visit their families in a l - ' ~ d h a ~ b . ' ~ '

Al-Khansa' bint 'Amr urged her sons
to fight on the night before the battle
In the Muslim women's camp in al-'Udhayb, al-Khansa' bint
'Amr - the poetess of Banu Sulayrn whose career straddled the
Jdhiliyah and I s l a m sat with her four grown sons, urging them to
fight. She said: "You became Muslim willmgly and migrated by
choice. You know what Allah has promised of great reward to the
Muslim who fight the kcifirs, and you know that the realm which
abides is better than the realm which will pass away. Allah says,
$0'you who believe! Endure and be more patient [than your enemy],
and guard your temtory [by stationing army units permanently at the

(Qur'an 3. 200)
you may be successful.)
If you wake up safe and sound tomorrow, insha 'Allrih, then go and
fight your enemy, seeking Allah's support against His enemies.
When you see the fighting grow intense, then go forth. If you do that,
you will gain booty and honour in the erea after."'^^

A woman of an-Nakh' encouraged her sons to jght
A woman from an-Nakh' had four sons who parhcipated in the
battle that day. When dawn started to break, she said to them: 'You
became Muslim and did not change, and you migrated but you did
not migrate to Yathrib (Madeenah)... Then you brought your elderly
mother and put her in front of the Persians. By Allah, you are the sons
of one man, just as you are the sons of one woman. I did not betray
your father and I did not cause any shame to your maternal uncles.
Go and part~cipatein the battle 6.om start to finish." So they left her,
hastening to join the battle. When they had left her, she raised her
hands towards heaven and said: "0' Allah, protect my sons." After
that they came hack to her, having fought well, and not one of them
was wounded. "'29
These are the attitudes of some of the elderly women on the first day
of al-Qikiis~yah.

2.4.2. The day of Aghwgth
The day of Aghwgth was the second day of al-Qidisiyah. On
this day a division of the Syrian army, led by al-Qa'q2 ibn 'Amr atTameemi, arrived. The caliph 'Umar (&) had ordered the governor
of Syria, Abu 'Ubaydah, to send the army of Khaid ibn al-Waleed

back to Iraq to support the Muslims in al-Qidisiyah. So he sent them,
but he kept Khglid with him because he needed him. He appointed
Hishim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqis, the nephew of Sa'd, in charge of
this army. When they had come from Iraq to Syria under the
leadership of Khilid ibn al-Waleed, they had been nine thousand
strong. Now six thousand of them were returning to Iraq. Hgshim ibn
'Utbah appointed al-Qa'q2 ibn 'Arm over the vanguard, which was
composed of one thousand warriors.'30

The heroic exploits of al-Qa'q6' ibn 'Amr
Al-Qa'qi' hastened, along with the vanguard, until they
reached the army in alQ2disiyah on the day of Aghwith. During his
march, he had come up with an idea to boost the morale of the
Muslims. He divided his army into one hundred sections, each of
which was formed of ten men, and told them to come, one group after
another; every time one group disappeared from view, they sent
another ten after them. He went forth with the first ten, then they
came in groups one after another. Every time al-Qa'q2 looked
towards the horizon and saw another group coming, he would say
takbeer and the Muslims would join in and were encouraged to
continue fighting their enemy. This strategy succeeded in raising the
moral of the fighters, for the arrival of one thousand men is not
regarded a large reinforcement for an army of thirty thousand, but
this idea to which Allah guided al-Qa'qi' made up for the small
number of reinforcements and strengthened the resolve of the
Muslims.
He gave them the good news of the arrival of more troops, and
said: "0' people... do what I do." He went forward and called out:
'Who will fight with me in single combat?" They said concerning
him what Abu Bakr had said: "NO army will be defeated among

whom there is a man like this," and they felt happy with him. Dhu al~ i i j i b ' ~came
'
out to meet bim and al-Qa'qi' asked him: "Who are
He said, "I am Bahman J%dhawayh." At this point alQa'qi' remembered the calamity that had befallen the Muslims on
the day of the bridge at the hands of this commander. He was seized
with Islamic zeal and called out, "Vengeance for Abu 'Ubayd, Sulayt
and the companions of the bridge!" Even though this Persian
commander was renowned for his bravery, his courage must have
failed him when he heard this cry. Abu Bakr had said of al-Qa'qi':
"The voice of al-Qa'qi' in an army is better than a thousand men.'33
How could a man withstand it, no matter how brave and steadfast he
was?" Hence al-Qa'qi' soon slew him in front of his troops. His
killing in this manner had a great effect of unnerving the Persians and
raising the moral of the Muslims, because he was the commander of
twenty thousand Persians. Then al-Qa'qi' called out again, "Who
will fight with me in single combat?" Two men came out to meet
him, one of whom was al-Bayrazin and the other was al-Bandawk.
Al-Qa'q2 was joined by al-Hith ibn Zabyin ibn al-Hith, the
brother of Banu Tameem al-Lit. Al-Qa'q2 fought with a l - B a r n
and killed him.134Ibn Zabyin fought with al-Bandawh, who was
one of the champions of the Persians and killed him. Thus at the
beginning of the day, al-Qa'qi' finished off two of the five Persian
commanders. Undoubtedly that threw the Persians into confusion,
which fuaher contributed to the demoralization of the Persian troops.
Two horsemen from each side met in combat, and al-Qa'qi' started
saying: "0' Muslnns, use your swords and reap the harvest." The

people started passing on this advice to one another, and rushed at the
enemy, and continued fighting until evening came. The narrators
state that al-Qa'q2 launched thirty charges; every time he saw
another group coming, he launched another charge. And the last one
who was killed was Burr; Jamhar al-Hamadhini.

'Alba' ibn Jahsh al-'Ujali: Disembowelled during t h baffle
A man from among the Persians appeared before the troops of
Bakr ihn W2il and called out, "Who will fight with me in single
combat?" 'Alba' ibn J&sh al-'Ujali went out to meet him. 'Alba'
struck the Persian a blow in his chest that damaged his lungs, then the
Persian struck him a blow in his belly and his intestines spilled out
and fell to the ground. The Persian died at once; as for 'Alba', he was
unable to stand. He tied to put his intestines back in place, but he
could not. A Muslim man passed by him, and 'Alba' said to him,
"Hey you, help me with my belly." So he helped him put his
intestines back in, then 'Alba' held the two sides of the wound
together and marched towards the Persian ranks, without looking
back at the Muslims. Death caught up with him thirty cubits from
where he furst fell, and he died saying,

"I was one of those who did well in battle, and
I hope that this will bring me a reward from our Lord."

Al-A'raf ibn al-A'lam al-'Uqayli
A man from among the Persians came out saying, "Who will
fight with me in single combat?" A1-A'raf ibn al-A'lam al-'Uqayli
came out to meet him and killed him. Then another came out to fight
him and he killed him. Then the horsemen surrounded him and threw
him down. He dropped his weapon and they took it, so he threw dust
in their faces until he got back to his companions.'35

The sac@ces made by the four sons of al-Khansa'
The four sons of al-Khansa' made the ultimate sacrifice on that
day. They went out to fight with zeal, and each of them recited verse
to encourage himself and brothers. They went out in turn and fought
until they were martyred.136When the news of her four sons reached
al-Khansa', she said: "Praise be to Allah Who has honoured me by
their deaths; I hope that my Lord will re-unite me with them by His
mercy."'37

A trick by al-Qa'qZ fhat had a
far-reaching efict on the Persians
On this day, the day of Aghwith, al-Qa'qi' ibn 'Amr and his
cousins fi-om Tameem played a trick that had a far-reach'mg effect on
the Persians. When he saw what the elephants had done to the
Muslims' horses on the first day, he and his people, by the help of
Allah, prepared the camels and made them look frightening, so as to
support the horses. They clothed them, adorned them and put masks
on their faces, then they mounted the foot soldiers on them and
swrouuded them with the horses to protect them. Then they attacked
the Persian horses with them, and did to them on the day of Aghwith
what they had done to the Muslims on the day of AmGth. There was
no group, large or small, at whom they charged, but that group's
horses got spooked and overwhelmed by the Muslims' horses. When
the people saw that, they began to copy them, and the Persians
suffered more because of the camels on the day of Aghwith than the
Muslims had suffered because of the elephants on the day of
Armith.138

Thus we see that the first Muslims excelled over their enemies
in military creativity. The Persians had exhausted the Muslims on the
first day by using the elephants, and since the Muslim had no
elephaots, they invented a tick using the camels that they did have,
to fool their enemies. This brilliant tick scared the enemy's horses
and caused them to panic and flee, along with their Persian riders.
This is how the Muslims should be they should excel in the field
of material preparation after excelling in the field of spiritual
preparation.

Abu Mihjan ath-Thaqaji in the heart of the battle
On the day of Aghwgth, the battle went on until midnight. That
night was called Laylat as-Sawed. Then the fighting stopped after
both sides retreated. The cessation of fighting was of great benefit for
the Muslims, as they were able to move their martyrs to their place of
burial in the valley of Musharriq, and they moved their wounded to
al-'Udhayb, where the women could take care of them. Abu Mihjan
ath-Thaqafi took part in the fighting for the first time on this night.139
Abu Mihjan had been detained and put in chains, and he was in the
palace. In the evening he went up to Sa'd and asked him to forgive
him and let him go. Sa'd rebuked him, so he went back down and
went to Salma bint Khasafah, and said: "0' Salma, 0' daughter of A1
W a f & , do you want to do something good?" She said, "What is
it?" He said, "Let me go and lend me al-Balqa' (a horse). By Allah, if
Allah keeps me safe and sound I will come back to you and put my
feet in these chains." She said, "Why would I do that?" So he went
back with his feet still in the chains, expressing in verse his sorrow at
not being able to join the army and fight alongside the Muslims, and
promising Allah that he would never visit taverns again if he got the
chance to join the army.

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

189

Salma said: "I prayed istikhtrah and I trust you." She let him
go and said, "But as for the horse, I will not lend it to you." She went
back to her house, but he shll took the horse; he led it out of the gate
of the castle that was closest to the ditch, then he mounted it and
galloped off until he approached the right flank of the army. Then he
said takbeer and charged at the left flank of the enemy, wielding his
spear and his weapon among the ranks. Then he went to the back of
the Muslim army and moved to the left flank, where he said takbeer
and charged at the right flank of the enemy, wielding his spear and his
weapon among the ranks. Then he went back behind the Muslim
army and charged at the heart of the enemy army, wielding his spear
and his weapon among the ranks. That night he fought the enemy in
an amazing manner, and the people were impressed with him, but
they did not know who he was, for they had not seen him at the
beginning of the battle. Some of them said, he must be one of the
companions of HGhim, or Hishim himself. As he was watching the
people, lying on his stomach at the top of the fort, Sa'd said: "By
Allah, were it not that Abu Mihjan is detained, I would have said that
this is Abu Mihjan and this (horse) is al-Balqa'." Rumours flew as to
who that man was. At midnight the Persians retreated and the
Muslims did likewise. Abu Mihjan went back to where he had come
out from, and put his feet back in thelr chains. Salma said to h i : "0'
Abu Mihjan, why did this man detain you?" He said, "By Allah, he
did not detain me for somethmg that I ate or drank, but I was a drinker
at the time of Jihili'h, and I am a poet, I say whatever comes to my
lips and sometimes that gets me into trouble. That is why he detained
me. I said in one of my poems:
'If I die, bury me next to a grapevine so that its roots may irrigate my
veins.
Do not bury me in the wilderness for I fear that I would never taste it
again.' "

The next day, Salma told Sa'd ihn Abi Waqq@ about what had
happened. He called him and let him go, saying, "Go, and I will not
hold anything against you for what you say unless you do it." He
said, "Rest assured that I will never do what my tongue says, if it says
something ~bjectionahle."'~~

Al-Qa'qgs plan in the latter part of the night of as-Sawid
One of the most important incidents that took place in the latter
half of the night of as-Sawid was when al-Qa'qi' ibn 'Amr took the
opportunity to make a plan to raise the morale of the Muslim troops
on the following day. He ordered his followers to sneak out and then
come back during the day, one group after another, each group
composed of one hundred waniors. He said to them, "When the sun
rises, come one hundred at a time; every time one group disappears
from sight, send another hundred. If Hkhim comes, all well and
good, otherwise this is a way to renew our people's hope and
energy."
When the sun started to rise, al-Qa'qi' was keeping a lookout.
He saw horses in the distance, so he said takbeer and the people
repeated his takbeer and said, the reinforcements have come. His
brother 'Asim ibn 'Amr followed his example, and told his people to
do the same thing. They came from another direction (Khaffan). No
sooner had the last of al-Qa'qi's companions come, hut Hishim ibn
'Uthah also anived with seven hundred men from the army of Syria.
When the last of the companions of al-Qa'qi' came, Hishim
appeared with seventy men.141 Here the reader may note the
humbleness of Hishim ihn 'Utbah ihn Ahi Waqq@, who agreed to
follow the best strategy: he split his army up into groups just as al-

'Umar ibn al-Khaggdb

191

Qa'q? ibn 'Amr had done. His ego and his position did not prevent
him kom following the opinion of one of the commanders who were
under him. He was one of the men who had been shaped by the
teachings of the Prophet (&), those who had begun to cancel their
egos and self-interests for the sake of the interests of Islam and the
Muslims. This is one of the main reasons for their success in
establishing the Islamic state and defeating the world powers of that
era. 142

2.4.3. The day of 'W
This was the third day, the day of 'Imk. The Persians came up
with a new plan to avoid the problems that they had faced on the first
day, when the belts of their elephants had been cut. They put foot
soldiers with each elephant to protect it, and horsemen to protect the
foot soldiers. The Muslims continued to fight the elephants and the
men on top of them and around them, and they found the going tough
indeed. When Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq2s (&) saw what a hard time the
Muslims were having, he sent word to some Persian Muslim who
were with the Muslim m y , asking them about the elephants and
where their weak points were. They said that the weak points were
the eyes and the trunk,the elephants could not function if these were
struck. So Sa'd sent word to al-Qa'q2 and 'Asim ibn 'Amr, telling
them: "Take care of the white elephant for me." Al-Qa'qi' was
familiar with it and was close to it. He also sent word to H d l ibn
M2& and Ribayyil ibn 'Amr al-Asadi, saying: "Take care of the
mangy elephant for me." They were familiar with it and were close to
it. Al-Qa'q2 and 'ASimtook their little spears and marched towards
the elephant with a squadron of horsemen and foot soldiers, and they
said to those who were with them, "Surround it and make it get

192

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Urnar

confused." The elephant started looking in confusion right and leR at
those who were around it. Al-Qa'qi' and '&im got near it and
attacked it whilst it was distracted by the people around it. They both
drove their little spears into the eyes of the white elephant, which
shook its head and threw its driver off. Then it lowered its trunk,and
al-Qa'qi' struck it with his sword and cut it off. The elephant fell on
its side, killing those who were on top of it. Hammil ibn Mil&
launched his attack and said to ar-Ribayyil ibn 'Amr: "You choose:
either you strike its trunk while I stab its eye, or you stab its eye while
I strike its trunk." He chose to strike its trunk,so Hammil charged at
it whilst it was distracted by those who were around it. Hammil
stabbed it in the eye, and the elephant fell on its back. Then it got up
and ar-Ribayyil struck it and chopped off its trunk. The elephant
driver saw him and struck him on the forehead and nose with an iron
stick, but both ar-Ribayyil and H
d managed to get away. The
elephants squealed like pigs at the loss of the two leading elephants
and started running away, stampeding the Persian m y , until they
crossed the river of al-'Ateeq and fled towards al-Madzin, and
everyone who had been riding them was killed.'43
Once the battlefield was h e of elephants, the people marched
against one another and the fighting intensified. The Persians had a
reserve army of elite fighters, and every time a gap appeared in their
ranks, Yazdagird would send for some of them. That day ended with
the Muslims and the enemy on an equal footing.144

The heroism of 'Amr i
h Ma'di Karib
'Amr ibn Ma'di Karib said: "I am going to attack the elephant
and the people around it. Do not leave me for longer than the time it
takes to slaughter a camel. If you come late, you will have lost Abu

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

193

Thawr (meaning himself), and how could you find another man like
Abu Thawr? If you come on time you will find me with my sword
still in my hand." So he charged and did not look back until he started
striking them and disappeared in a cloud of dust. His companions
said, "What are you waiting for? You are going to lose him, and if
you lose h i , the Muslims will have lost their knight." So they
charged and the rnushnkeen separated around him after throwing him
to the floor and stabbing him,but his sword was still in his hand and
he was striking them. His horse had also been stabbed. When he saw
his companions and realized that the Persians had backed away from
him, he grabbed the leg of a Persian horse whose rider was trying to
make it move; the horse stumbled and the Persian looked at 'Amr and
wanted to kill him. The Muslims saw him and rushed to help him.
The Persian dismounted and m back to his companions and 'Amr
said: "Give me the reins." They gave h i the reins and he mounted
the horse and rode off.145

Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi
The fighting contmued on the third day until night came, then
the voice of Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi, who had gone behind
the Persian lines, made them stop fighting and break apart. That
scared the Persians and amazed the Muslims, and they stopped
fighting to see what was happening. Sa'd (&) had sent h i with
some other people to guard a place where the Muslims might be
exposed to danger, and he went beyond the call of duty and came
from behind the Persians, and shouted "AllihuAkbar -Allah is AllGreat" three times.'46 This tactic proved useful, as the fighting
stopped and there was an opportunity to regroup and prepare for the
mght fighting.

Qays ibn al-Makshooh
When he returned from Syria along with Hishim ihn 'Utbah,
he addressed the people saying: "0' Arabs, Allah has blessed you
with Islam and has honoured you with Muhammad &), and you
have become brothers by Allah's grace. Your call is one and you are
united, aRer you had been enemies of one another, fighting one
another like lions and snatching one another like wolves. Support
(the cause of) Allah and He will support you, and Allah will grant
you victory over the Persians. Allah granted victory to your brothem
in Syria and they seized the red palaces and the red fo~tresses."'~~

The night of al-Hareer
The fighting started on the night of al-Hareer, ahead of the
fourth day. The Persians changed their tactics on this night. Rustam
realized that his army had not achleved the same level of
horsemanship in battle as the Muslims ha4 and they did not even
come close. So he decided to make the whole army charge at once, so
as to avoid the kind of setbacks he had previously encountered,
which had destroyed the morale of his troops. None of the Persians
came out for single combat afier the brilliant performance of the
Muslim champions. Rustam arranged his m y in thlrteen rows m the
core and on both flanks. Al-Qa'q2' ibn 'Amr began to fight,
accompanied by the elite forces, before Sa'd said takbeer, but he let
them off and prayed for forgiveness for them. When he said takbeer
three bmes, the commanders and all the a p y marched forward, m
three ranks, the archers, the horsemen and the foot soldiers. The
fighting that night was very intense, and they continued fighting from
the fitst part of the night until morning, not speaking at all and
communicating only in grunts (al-hareer), so that night was called
the night of al-Hareer. The Muslim encouraged one another to strive

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

195

their utmost in fighting, because they were expecting a tough fight.
Among their words that have been narrated concerning that are the
f0110win~~~~:
Durayd ibn Ka'b an-Nakha'i said to his people: "The Muslims
are preparing for the fight, so be among the first of the Muslims to
fight for Allah and in jihad tonight, for no one will be among the first
tonight but his reward will be in accordance with how soon he joined
the fight. Compete with them for martyrdom and be content with
death, for this is the best way to avoid death if you want to live and if
you do not, then the Hereafter is what you are seeking."
Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays said: "0' Arabs, these people (the
Persians) should not be more daring in facing death and less
concerned about worldly gains than you. Compete for wives and
children and do not fear death, for this is the wish of the noble people
and the means of martyrdom."149
Humay(lah ibn an-Nu'& d-B&qi said: "On the night of alHareer there was a fully-armed Persian squadron near the tribe of
Ju'E, so they marched upon them and fought them with the sword,
but they saw that their swords were having no effect on the =our
they were wearing, so they retreated. H u m a y w ibn an-Nu'mk d Bikiqi said to them, 'What is the matter with you?' They said, 'Our
weapons are not effective against them.' He said, 'Wait here until I
show you.' So they watched, and Humaydah attacked one of their
men kom behmd, striking him with a spear. Then he turned to his
companions and said, 'I think this is the way to kill them.' So they
attacked them and pushed them back."150

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

Near the tribe of Kindah there was Turk at-Tabari, one of the
Persian commanders. Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays al-Kindi said: "0' people,
march towards them." So he marched towards them with seven
hundred men and pushed them back, and he killed their commander,
Turk.
The fighting that night was intense and non-stop. The leaders
of the tribes encouraged their tribes to be steadfast and patient. One
indication of the intensity of the fighting on that night was the report
narrated by at-Tabari from Anas ibn al-Hulays, who said: "I was
present on the night of al-Hareer, where the clash of iron was like the
sound of the blacksmith all night, until morning came. They were
given a great deal of patience. Sa'd spent a night such as he had never
spent, and the Arabs and Persians saw something the l i e of which
they had never seen. There was no more news from either Rustarn or
Sa'd, and Sa'd started to make du 'd' until the night was half over.
Sa'd understood that as meaning that victory was nigh, so Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqh spent the night praying to Allah and seekimg His
support. It is worth noting here that Sa'd was a man whose du '6'was
answered.'"

2.4.4. The day of al-Qgdisiyah
On the fourth day the Muslims were still fightmg. Al-Qa'qi'
ibn 'Amr went about among the people and said, "Victory will come
soon to those who show patience, so be patient for a while and attack,
for victory comes with patience, so prefer patience over panic." A
number of leaders gathered around him and they charged at Rustam,
until at dawn they reached the troops who were near him.When the
tribes saw thaf their leaders stood up to address them. Qays ibn

'Umar ibn al-Khattrfb

197

'Abdi Yaghooth, al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, 'Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrib, Ibn
Dhi as-Sahmayn al-Khash'ami and Ibn Dhi al-Burdayn al-Hil%
stood up and said: "These people (the Persians) should not have more
courage in facing death than you, or be more wlling to forfeit this
world than you." Some men of Rabee'ah stood up and said, "You are
the most knowledgeable of people about the Persians and you were
more courageous against them in the past. What is stopping you now
from being more courageous than you were before?"15'
Thus we see another aspect of the brilliance of al-Qi'qi' ibn
'Amr, whose brilliance was manifested in many ways. Allah blessed
him with a combination of rare courage, wisdom and strong faith, and
he used all of that to support Islam and the Muslims. His joining the
battle was a great support to the Muslims. Al-Qa'qi' realized that the
enemy was m i n g out of patience after the fighting had gone on for
a day and a night non-stop, and before that for two days with only a
short respite. By means of his insight and lengthy experience -after
the guidance of AUah -he knew that the consequences of the battle
would be in favour of those who showed patience after this lengthy
and exhaustive struggle. Al-Qa'qi' and the heroes who were with
him managed to penetrate deeply into the core of the Persian army
until they found themselves close to Rustam at noon. At this point the
support of Allah came down and He supported His close fiends
(awliya ') with troops from Him, a violent wind, the daboor or west
wind, blew and carried the cover away from the throne of Rustam,
throwing it into the al-'Ateeq river. Then dust blew up in the faces of
the Persians and hindered their defence.153

The slaying of the Persian commander Rustam
Al-Qa'qi' and those who were with him advanced until they
found the throne of Rustam, which they dld not see before because of
the dust. Rustam had left the throne and sheltered behind a mule,
which fell on top of him without him realizing it and damaged a disk
in his back. Rustam fled towards the al-'Ateeq river to try and save
himself, but Hilil caught up with him. He grabbed his leg, then he
dragged hlm and killed hm, then he climbed on top ofthe throne and
shouted, "I have killed Rustam, by the Lord of the Ka'bah! Come to
me!" The core of the Persian army fled. The other Muslm
commanders also advanced towards those who were opposite them,
and the Persians retreated before them. When al-Jalinus realized that
Rustam had been killed, he stood on the dam that had been made in
the river and called the P a i a n s to cross, fleeing from death, and they
crossed. As for the Persian troops who were in chains, of whom there
were thirty thousand, they rushed into the al-'Ateeq river and the
Musllms stabbed them with thew spears, and not one of them
escaped.154

The end of the battle
The battle ended by the grace of Allah, then by the efforts of
the Muslim heroes and the wisdom of their commander, Sa'd ihn Abi
Waqqb. It was a fierce and tough battle in which the enemies resisted
the Muslims for three days, until Allah defeated them on the fourth
day, whereas the Muslims usually defeated their enemies in one day.
One of the reasons for this resistance was the fact that the Persians
regarded this battle as decisive: if they won, their state would abide,
but if they lost their state would perish and would never recover after
that. Another reason for their resistance was the presence of their
greatest leader, Rustam, at the head of the m y , who was a

'Umar ibn al-Khaffib

199

commander with a history of victories against his enemies, in
addition to the Persians' superiority in numbers and equipment. The
Persians numbered some one hundred and twenty thousand warriors,
not counting their followers, as well as the reinforcements sent daily
by Yazdagird, whereas the number of Muslims was thirty-odd
thousand.155Despite all that, the Muslims defeated them after they
sent on 8500 martyrs.156 This number of martyrs is the largest
number of any battle during the first Muslim conquests. The fact that
the number was so high is indicative of the fierceness of the battle
and of the Muslims' willingness to expose themselves to martyrdom.
May Allah be pleased with them all.''

Pursuing the remnants of the defeated army
Sa'd (&) issued orders that the remnants of the defeated army
be pursued. He sent al-Qa'qi' ibn ' A m and Shur&beel ibn as-Sam
al-Kindi off nght and left in pursuit of those who had not crossed the
river, and he ordered Zuhrah ibn al-Hawiyah to pursue those who had
crossed the river with their commanders. The Persians had made a
hole in the dam so that the Muslims would not be able to follow them
but Zuhrah and three hundred horsemen managed to cross with their
horses. He ordered those who did not manage to cross to come via the
bridge, even though it was a little furtber, and catch up with them. AlJalinus, who was one of their top commanders, was travelling at the
rear of the army in order to protect them. Zuhrah caught up with him
and they fought; they exchanged two blows and Zubrah killed him
and took his possessions. They pursued the Persians and killed some
of them, then in the evening they went back to al-Qidisiyah with the
~uslirns.'~~

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the 7ime of 'Umar

Good news of the victoy reaches 'Umar (&)
Sa'd wrote to the caliph 'Umar (&) telling him of the victory,
sending the letter with Sa'd ibn 'Umaylah al-FazE He said in his
letter: "Allah has granted us victory over the Persians, and has given
them the same punishment as those who came before them, after a
lengthy fight and much distress. They fought the Muslims with
numbers the like of which has never been seen before, but Allah did
not benefit them thereby, rather He benefited the Muslims instead.
The Muslims followed them along the rivers and riverbanks, and in
the mountain passes. Among the Muslims, Sa'd ibn 'Ubayd a l - Q 3
and So and so and So and so were killed, and other Muslim men
whom we do not know, but Allah knows who they are. They used to
recite the Qur'an with a sound like the buzzing of bees when mght
came, and they were the lions of mankind, although lions cannot
compare to them. Those who passed away are not better than those
who were left, except by virtue of martyrdom, because martyrdom
was not decreed for them."lS9
We learn several things from this letter, such as the following:
Sa'd's attitude of Tawheed, and how he glorified AUah and
declared that he himself had no power or strength; the victory over
their enemies came from Allah alone, and did not come by the
strength of the Muslims, despite the great efforts and sacrifices that
they made and despite the huge strength and numbers of the enemy.
The outcome of the battle was not up to the people, rather it was all
under Allah's control. He is the One Who deprived the enemy of
benefiting from their strength, and He is the One Who allowed the
Muslims to benefit from their strength. Human beings are simply the
means by which Allah grants benefit or harm. Allah is the Only One
Who can ward off harm or bring benefits. Thus Sa'd (&)

'Umar ibn aI-KhaMb

201

understood the meaning of Tawheed, and he lived it with his troops
day by day. In his letter, we see Sa'd describing the Sahcibah (may
Allah be pleased with them) and the Tcibi 'eenwho were with them, as
excelling in worship and courage, for they were worshippers by
night, reciting the Qur'an with a sound like bees humming, never
becoming tired or exhausted, and by day they were knights whose
courage and steadfastness could not he matched even by lions.160
'Umar (&) would stand outside Madeenah to see if anyone
was coming from al-QSdisiyah. He would wait from moming until
mid-day, then he would go back to his family and his home. When
the bringer of glad tidings came, he said, "Where have you come
from?" He told him, and he said, "0' slave of AUah, tell me!" He
said, "Allah has defeated the enemy." 'Umar ran beside him, askiog
him questions, and the man on the camel did not know who he was,
until they entered Madeenah and the people started greeting him as
Ameer al-Mu'mineen. He said, "Why didn't you tell me that you
were the Ameer al-Mu'mineen, may Allah have mercy on you?"
'Umar said, "Don't worry about it, 0' my brother."l6l
From this report we learn a number of things, including the
following:
0:-

The great interest of 'Umar, which led him to go out into the desert
every day in hope of fmding riders coming from Iraq, so that
he could ask them about news of the Muslims and their
enemies. He could have delegated someone else to bring the
news to hi,but his deep interest and concern for the Muslims
would not let him do that. This is the ultimate mercy and sense
of responsibility.

202

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Eme of 'Umar

'Umar's deep humility. He kept running alongside the rider,
asking him for news of the battle. That messenger did not want
to tell him the details until he reaqhed the caliph, and he did not
realize that the caliph was the man who was speaking to him
and running beside him, until he learned that from the people
in Madeenah. This is a great character and attitude for which
the Muslims are entitled to feel proud before the entire world,
for it is indicative of the greatness of this religion which
produced men like 'Umar who were so just, merciful, resolved
and humble.162

2.5. Lessons and benefits
2.5.1. The date of the battle and its effect
on the progress of the conquests
Historians differ concerning the date of this battle. Professor
m a d 'Adil h & lhas researched the matter well, and reached the
conclusion that it took place in Sha'bin of 15A . H . ' ~I~am inclined to
favour this view.
There can be no doubt that al-Qidisiyah comes at the top of the
list of decisive battles in the history of the world, and that it sbows
how divine support comes to those who are true believers. As a result
of this battle, the gates of Iraq, and thence all of Persia, were opened.
After that, Muslim victories came one after another. It brought the
end of the Sassanids in a political and military sense, and the end of
Magianism in a religious sense. From here the religion of Islam
spread throughout Persia and beyond. In al-Qidisiyah the Muslims

'Umar ibn al-KhaGdb

203

dealt a blow to the Persians from which they never recovered. Hence
al-Qidisiyah deserves to be at the top of the list of decisive battles in
human h i ~ t 0 r y . l ~ ~

2.5.2. 'Umar's speech after the victory of al-Qgdisiyah
When news of the victory reached 'Umar (&), he announced
it to them, and said: "I am very keen not to leave any need without
meeting it, so long as we are flexible with one another. If that is not
possible then we should support one another until we are all equal
and have enough to survive. I wish you knew what I have in my heart
for you, but there is no way for you to know except by my actions. By
Allah, I am not a king to enslave you; rather I am a slave of Allah
who has been given a trust. If I keep away from the public wealth and
I spend it on you and make sure that you all have enough food and
water in your houses, then I would be blessed. If I kept it for myself, I
would have a short-lived joy, but I would be doomed for a long
time.v165

2.5.3. Fulfilment of agreements among the
Muslims, and justice with no compromise
Sa'd wrote another letter to 'Umar (&), asking him for
instructions regarding the ah1 adh-dhimmah of the Arabs of Iraq who
had broken their treaty when the Muslims were weak. 'Umar stood
up and addressed the people, saying: "Whoever acts on whims and
desires and sin loses out and harms no one but himself; whoever
follows the Sunnah and adheres to laws and follows the right path,
seeking that which is with Allah for those who obey Him, is doing

the right thing and is a winner. Allah ( B )says:
B ~ n dthey will find all that they did, placed before them, and your
Lord treats no one with injustice.)
(Qurhn 18: 49)
The Muslims have defeated their enemies and the original inhabitants
have moved on, and there are some people (who did not move on
and) who have come to the Muslims on the basis of their previous
covenant. What do you think of those who claim that they were
forced to join the enemy; and those who did not make such a claim
and did not stay, but rather moved on; and those who stayed and did
not make any claim or move on; and those who surrendered?"
They agreed to honour the commitment to those who stayed
and did not cause any harm, and that those who made a claim and
were believed and those who fulfilled the covenant should be treated
appropriately, but if they were not believed, they should be told that
there is no covenant and a new covenant should be drawn up. As for
those who had left their land and joined the Persians, if they wished
they could make a new covenant with the Muslims, and they would
come under Muslim protection, or the Muslims could continue to
keep them from their land and not give them any option but fighting.
Those who stayed and s m d e r e d could be given the choice
between payingjizyah or leaving; and the same choice was offered to
the peasants.'66
We learn a number of lessons kom this, including the following:

'Umar (&) applied the principle of shoora, whereby he used
to consult the people of wisdom in all his important affairs, despite
the fact that he was known for abundant knowledge and deep
wisdom. This noble conduct was one of the reasons for his great
success in ruling the ummah. In these words with which 'Umar
'66

Tireekh a?-&ban, 41410

'Umar ibn al-Kha@?b

205

prefaced his consultation, he reminded the Sahibah of the necessity
of avoiding whims and desires and the importance of being sincere in
one's intention towards Allah, and of adhering to the straight path as
set out by the Messenger of Allah @). Whoever does that will be
protected kom making errors ofjudgement in ruling, will see things
l ~ ~ summed up this
correctly and will win the reward of ~ 1 1 a h .'Umar
advice in a letter which he sent to Sa'd ibn Ahi Waqq@, in which he
said: "In all things Allah has allowed concessions in certain
situations, except in two things: justice and dhikr. As for dhikr
(remembrance of Allah), there is no concession under any
circumstances and Allah accepts nothing but a great deal of it. As for
justice, there is no concession in it, whether at times of hardship or of
ease. Even if justice appears soft, it is stronger than injustice and is
more able to eliminate falsehood than injustice. Whoever among the
Arabs of Iraq was true to his covenant and did not help the enemy
against you in any way, is entitled to protection and is obliged to pay
the jizyah. As for those who claim that they were forced but did not
come and join you or leave and go elsewhere, do not believe them
unless you want to; if you do not want to, then cancel the deal with
them and send them wherever is safe for them."16'
From this response we learn a number of lessons, including the
following:
"Justice in ruling is the main foundation for Islam to rule and prevail,
and for security and prosperity to spread in the Muslim lands. This
has to do with this world. As for the Hereafter, there is no escape for
the wrongdoers and oppressors, because with regard to the rights of
Allah, He may forgive His slave for any tmnsgressions, but when it
comes to the rights of other people, on the Day of Resurrection Allah

will detain the wrongdoers and those who were wronged so that they
may settle the scores among one another. With regard to
remembrance of Allah (dhikr), it must dominate the life of the
Muslim, in his heart and on his lips, in all that he does, so that his
thoughts are sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, he speaks only
words that are pleasing to Him, and he acts only for His sake, and his
main aim is to establish the remembrance of Allah on earth in word,
deed and belief. If he achieves that, AUah will protect him from the
confusion caused by specious arguments and whims and desires.
Sa'd and the Muslims who were with him followed the insbuctions
of the caliph and offered to those who were around them who had left
their land the option of coming back, in which case they would have
protection in return for paying thejizyah. Here we see an example of
compassion and softening people's hearts. This generous treatment
had the effect of making the Muslims and Islam dear to those who
had broken the covenant, and after thai they gradually started to enter
Islam and become sincere followers of the faith."16'

2.5.4. 'Umar gave the Wlurns of alQgdisiyah
to the fighters, and rewarded those who
had distinguished themselves in battle
'Umar (&) ordered that the khums of al-Qiidisiyah should be
given to the fighters, and Sa'd carried out the caliph's command. This
ijtihad of 'Umar was quite brilliant, as was his ijtihad deciding to
leave the land of as-~awiid'~'in the hands of its people. He thought
that it was in accordance with the interests of the state to distribute the

As-Sawrid ("black land" - in contrast to the Arabian desert) refers to the
fertile lowlands of lraq west of the Tigris. [Hitti, History of the Arabs, p. 155,
n. 2, quoting Ya'qoot, vol. 3, p. 1741 - flranslator]

'Umar ibn al-Khattdb

207

khums among the Mujihideen, so as to encourage them, make things
easier for them, and acknowledge their efforts.171 'Umar sent four
swords and four horses to Sa'd, to he given as a reward to those who
had done best in the war in Iraq. He gave out the swords, three to men
of Banu Asad, namely Hammil ibn Maik, ar-Rihayyil ihn 'Amr ibn
Rabee'ah and Tulayhah ihn Khuwaylid; and the fourth he gave to
'&im ihn 'Amr at-Tameemi. He gave one of the horses to al-Qa'qi'
ihn 'Amr at-Tameemi, and the other three to al-Yarboo'iyeen, as a
reward to them for the ha!de of ~ ~ h w i t h . ' "These are some of the
means which 'Umar used to motivate the Mujihideen and the
Muslims to achieve noble aims.

2.5.5. How 'Umar restored the dignity
of Zuhrah ibn al-Hawiyah
Zuhrah returned from his pursuit of the remnants of the Persian
army. After killing Jalinus, one of the Persian commanders, azZuhrah took his possessions and put on the armour that Jalinus had
worn. The prisoners who were with Sa'd recognized it and said,
"These are the possessions of Jalinus." Sa'd asked him: "Did anyone
help you to kill him?" He said, 'Yes." He then asked, "Who?" He
said, "Allah." At that time Zuhrah was a young man who had been a
leader during the Jihiliyah and did well in Islam. Sa'd got angry at
how quickly Zuhrah had put on the armour of Jalinus. He thought
that was too much and took it away from him, saying, "Why didn't
you wait for my pennission?"173 News of that reached 'Umar and he
sent word to Sa'd saying, "How can you go to someone like Zuhrah,

when he has done what he has done and there are still many battles
ahead, and do something to break his spirit and discourage him? Give
him back his loot and favour him over his companions by giving him
five hundred more, for I have granted everyone who kills a man
permission to take his possessions." So he gave it back to hlm and he
sold it for seventy thousand.174Thus 'Umar restored az-Zuhrah's
dignityb7'

2.5.6. The martyrdom of the mu'adh-dhin and
the Muslims' competing to give the adhlin
During the battle of al-Q%siyah, something amazing took
place which is indicative of the extent of the early Muslims' concern
for religious matters and things that would bring them closer to Allah.
The m u hdh-dhin of the Muslims was killed on that day, and when
the time for prayer came, the Muslims competed for giving the
a d h t n , to the extent that they almost fought with swords over it. Sa'd
drew lots among them, and the man whose name was drawn gave the
~ d h c i n . 'The
~ ~ competition for this righteous deed is an indication of
their strength of faith, for the adhcin brings no worldly gain, status or
fame. Rather the motivation for this competition was their
remembering the great reward that Allah has prepared for the
mu'adh-dhins on the Day of Resurrection. People who competed for
the adhcin would certainly compete for matters more serious than
that. This is the secret of their success in jihad for the sake of Allah
and in calling people to slam.'^^

2.5.7. Islamic military tactics in battle
Al-QXsiyah was a brilliant example of Islamic military
tactics. The Muslims excelled in devising tactical manoeuvres that
suited the situation. We can see 'Umar's ability in general
mobilization and compulsory conscription, and using all available
resources. In this battle the caliph used all available resources, both
general troops and an elite force of Muslims. He wrote to Sa'd,
instructing him to choose men with horses and weapons who were
experienced and courageous. In this battle, Sa'd gathered seventyodd of those who had been present at Badr, three hundred and
after
umpteen of those who bad been Companions of the Prophet
the oath of allegiance at ar-Ridwin, three hundred of those who had
been present at the Conquest of MaMcah and seven hundred of the
sons of the Sahibah. He did not leave any leader, wise man,
prominent man, orator or poet but he sent him against them; he sent
the best and most prominent of the people against the enemy. Thus he
used all material and moral resources in this battle.

a)

In the mobilization for this battle we see a new idea that was
previously unknown to the Muslims: Sa'd did not wait in S i A until
his army was complete before setting off for Iraq; rather he set out
with four thousand men and reached the battle site in al-Qidisiyah
with seventeen thousand. This was an innovative way of mobilizing
the army which was unknown to the Muslims before 'Umar. In his
letters to both al-Muthanna and Sa'd, 'Umar told them where this
decisive battle was to be fought, and that was at al-QXsiyah. 'Umar
was the 6rst Muslim leader to use maps in studying the land and
environment of the battle, when he asked Sa'd to describe the land to
him in a detailed letter, telling him where the Muslim camps were, so
that it was as if he could see if and to give him a clear picture of the
Muslims' situation. Sa'd wrote him a letter in which he described in
detail the geography of al-QXsiyah between the ditch and the al-

210

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the lime of 'Umar

'Ateek river and what lay to the right and leR, then he described the
environment in the surrounding land, and told him that the local
inhabitants were hostile towards the Muslims. Based on this, the
caliph made his tactical and strategic decision^."^ From the time
they arrived in the enemy's land, the Muslims used the tactic of
raiding enemy supplies and exhausting them in this manner. These
raids met the army's need for supplies and in addition to that they also
served another important purpose, which was sapping the energy of
the enemy and the ability of the local people to withstand the burdens
and suffering of war. The Muslims also used the tactic of ambushing
in their skirmishes with the Persians before al-Q2disiyah and in their
efforts to exhaust the enemy and weaken their morale. Bakeer ibn
'Abdnll* al-Laythi, along with a group of Muslim horsemen,
ambushed a caravan in a stand of date palms on the road to a$Saneen, in which the sister of Az2dmard the son of Azkbbah, the
ruler of al-Heerah, was being taken as a bride to the ruler of qSaneen. When the caravan reached the place of ambush, the Muslims
attacked it. Bakeer broke the back of SheerzGd the son of AzXhbah,
the brother of the bride, who was at the head of the cavalry that was
riding ahead of the caravan. The horses fled, galloping away with
their riders. The Muslims seized all the other loads, and captured the
daughter of AzXhbah, along with thirty womenfolk of the chieftains
and one hundred followers, and the value of the goods they were
canying with them is

In this battle the Muslims changed their tactics according to
new developments on the battlefield. On the fust day we see them
trying to tackle the elephants, cutting their ropes after shooting them
with arrows, until they fled fcom the battlefield. They were awaiting
reinforcements &om Syria, and they brought the reinforcements to

'Umar ibn al-Khan66

21 1

the battlefield in groups, one after another, to alarm the enemy with
their apparent numbers. Then they tried a brilliant tick of dressing up
their camels and putting masks on them to make them look like
elephants. They sent them into the enemy ranks, where they terrified
the horses and made them flee. on the third day, the Muslims again
tackled the Persian elephants which were protected by horsemen and
foot soldiers. They attacked the biggest elephant, stabbing it in the
eyes and cutting off its trunk;the elephants fled, and the Persians and
Muslims became on an equal footing in the battlefield after the
Persians lost their elephants, which were like tanks. When the
Muslims saw that the fight was going to be a lengthy one, they
decided on a general attack. They set their ranks in order and
marched as one. As soon as the enemy began to retreat and the core
of the army became exposed, Rustam, the leader of the enemy army,
became their target. When they f ~ s h e off
d Rustam, the Persian army
suffered a crushing defeat. Thus we see that the methods used by the
Muslims in this battle were not restricted to traditional methods of
fighting, rather they responded to every situation with what was best.
They moved away kom primitive methods such as single combat to
tactical moves, such as disguising their camels, cutting the ropes of
the elephants, stabbing them in the eye and cutting off their trunks,
andusing classical methods of fighting such as targeting the leader.
This battle was distinguished by mobilization along tribal lines, the
advantage of which was that there was competition among the tribes
in fighting.180These are some of the Islamic military methods used
by the Mujihideen in al-Qidisiyah.

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the lfme of 'Umar

2.6. The conquest of al-Madgin (Ctesiphon)
Sa'd stayed in al-QXisiyah for two months, awaiting
instructions fiom 'Umar, until there came the command to conquer
al-MaWin and to leave the women and children in al-'Ateeq with
many soldiers around them. He told him that the soldiers who stayed
behind should have a share of the booty too, because they were
staying behind to guard the families of the Muslims. Sa'd did that and
set out with the army towards the end of Shawwil. The remnants of
the defeated m y , among whom were the remaining commanders
who were determined to defend themselves, had gone to Bibil. The
cities and towns of Persia began to fall one after another. The
Muslims conquered al-Burs, then Bibil after crossing the Euphrates,
then Koothi, then SihiL part of it by force and part of it by means of
a peace deal.''' The organized campaign of the Muslims continued
until they reached al-Mad2in. 'Umar told Sa'd to be kind to the
peasants and to fullil the covenants with them, and a huge number of
peasants came under Muslim protection. The peasants were moved
by the attitude, justice and equality of the Muslim army, which
stemmed fiom their great religion, where their leader and the least
one among the common folk were equal before the greater truth.
There was no oppression, no corrnption in the land, and they were no
longer subject to tyranny or enslavement such as they used to suffer.
They became slaves of Allah alone.
Sa'd headed towards a l - M d i n , on 'Umar's orders. He sent
the vanguard of the army on ahead, under the leadership of Zuhrah
ibn al-Hawiyah, followed by 'Abdulliih ibn al-Mu'attam with a part
of the army, and Shafiabeel ibn as-Sam* with another part, then
Hkshim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqis, whom he had made his deputy

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

21 3

instead of Khilid ibn ' ~ r f u @ h . 'Then
~ ~ Sa'd joined them with the
rest of the army, and appointed Khilid ibn 'Urfu* in command of
the rear guard.
Zuhrah, at the head of the vanguar4 headed towards alMadi'in, which was the capital of the Persian state. The city
straddled the Tigris west and east. The part which lay to the west of
the river was called Bahurseer and the part that lay to the east was
called Asbaneer and Ctesiphon. Zuhrah anived at Bahurseer and
started to lay siege to the city. Then Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqe took the
Muslim m y , accompanied by the commander of his forces, bis
nephew Hkhim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqis, to the western part of alMadi'in, where the king of Persia, Yazdagird, was. The Muslims
besieged the city for two months, with the Persians coming out
sometimes to fight the Muslims, but unable to defeat them.

Zuhrah ibn al-Hawiyah was struck by an mow, because he
was wearing chain-mail that had a hole in it. They had said to him,
'Why don't you get this hole fuced so that arrows cannot penetrate
it?" He said, "Why?" They said, "We fear for you." He said, "I will
be dear to Allah if an arrow misses all these soldiers and comes to me
through this hole and strikes me M y . " And he was indeed dear to
Allah as he had hoped, and he was the first of the Muslims to be
struck by an arrow that day. It shuck him !irmly through that hole,
and some of them said, "Pull it out from him." He said, "Let me be,
for I will still be able to cany on if it is still in me, and I hope that I
can still strike some of them." He marched towards the enemy and
struck Shahray*, who was from Astakhar, and killed him.lS3
The Muslims continued the siege for two months, using
twenty catapults that the Persians who were allied with them had

made for them, with which they scared the Persians. This indicates
that the Sahibah (may Allah be pleased with them all) did not neglect
any material means of victory if they were able to use if and they
fully understood the words of Allah,
(And make ready against them all you can of power) ( f i r 'an 8: 601,
- in addition to their excellence in terms of spiritual means of

victory, the most important of which are relying on Allah,
remembering Him ( d h i b ) and calling upon Him (du'i').

2.6.1. Allah is with His close friends
by His support and help
It was narrated that Anas ibu al-Halees said: "Whilst we were
besieging Bahurseer, a messenger looked out at us and said, 'The
king says to you, is there any way to make a peace deal by which we
will have what is on our side between the Tigris and our mountain,
and you will have what is on your side between the Tigris and your
mountain? Are you not satisfied, may you never be satisfied!' Abu
Mufazzir al-Aswad ibn Qutbah spoke up before anyone else, and
Allah caused him to speak words that neither he nor we understood.
The man went back and we saw them crossing the river to the east of
a l - M d i n . We asked, "0' Abu Mufazzir, what did you say to him?"
He said, "By the One Who sent Muhammad with the lmth, I do not
know what it was but I feel content, and I hope that I was made to say
something good." The people came asking him the same question,
one after another, until Sa'd heard of that and came to us. He said,
"0' Abu Mufazzir, what did you say? For by Allah they are running
away," and he told him the same as he had told us. He called out to
the Persians but no one came out of the city except one man who
asked for safe passage, which we granted to him. He said, "There is
no one left inside, what is stopping you?" So the men entered the city

'Umar ibn al-Khatgrfb

21 5

and conquered it. We did not find anyone or anything inside the city,
except a few prisoners whom we took captive. We asked them and
that man why the people had fled, and they said: "The king sent word
to you offering a peace treaty and you told him that there would never
be any peace treaty between us and you, until we eat honey in
Koothii." The king said, "What is this? The angels are speaking on
their lips and answering us on behalf of the Arabs. By Allah, what
this man says indicates that we are going to be finished, so seek
protection on the other side of the

2.6.2. The verses which Sa'd recited
when he reached Mawam SabSt
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqiis (&) stopped in M a a a m Sabiit afier
Hiishim and those who were with him came to Bahurseer, which was
the western part of al-Madsin. When Sa'd stopped in that place, he
recited the words of Allah,
(And warn 10' Muhammad] mankind of the Day when the torment
will come unto them., then the wrongdoers will say: 'Our Lmd!
Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the
Messengers!' [It will be said]: 'Had you not sworn aforetime that you
would not leave [the world for the Hereafter].') (Qurhn 14: 44)
He recited this verse because in that place there were troops of
Chosroes called Boo&, who swore by Allah every day that the
Persian kingdom would never perish so long as they lived.lS5Zuhrah
ibn al-Hawiyah defeated them and scattered them before he was
maxtyred.lS6When the Muslims entered Bahurseer, in the middle of

the night, they saw the white palace which was the palace of
Chosroes. Dirir ibn al-KhatJib said: ''Allihu Akbar, the white
(palace) of Chosroes! This is what Allah and His Messenger
promised," and they continued to say takbeer until dawn came.18'

2.6.3. Consultation between Sa'd and
his troops about crossing the river
When Sa'd realized that Chosroes had crossed the river to the
eastern part of al-Madi'in, taking all the boats with hi,he became
confused. The enemy was in front of him, with nothing between them
except the river, but there was no way of crossing it because there
were no boats. He was afiaid that his enemy would move on and it
would become difficult to finish them off. Then some of the Persians
came to Sa'd and showed him a ford where they could cross the river
with some risk. Sa'd refused and hesitated, then the river burst its
banks and its water turned black and started foaming because the
water was running so fast. At that point Sa'd saw a good dream m
which he saw the Muslim horses crossing the river, and he interpreted
the dream as meaning that they would cross. He gathered the people
and praised and glorified Allah, then he said: "Your enemies have
protected themselves fiom you by means of this river and you cannot
reach them, but they can reach you, if they wish, in their boats. There
is nothing behind you to make you fear an attack from the rear, for the
previous Muj6hideen have taken care of them for you. I think that
you should hasten to launch jihad against your enemy, and I have
decided to cross this river and go after them." They all said, "May
Allah guide us and you; do it."lS8
We learn the following lessons from this report:

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

21 7

We are reminded that Allah is with His believing close friends
and supports and helps them. The good dreams that Sa'd (&) saw
were from Allah, and they made him steadfast and encouraged him to
go ahead with this matter, the consequences of which were unknown,
and Allah would cause the consequences to be in the believers'
favour. The river suddenly started to flow quickly in an unusual
manner, and it would appear that this was in the Persians' interests,
because it would prevent the Muslims from attempting to cross the
river. But in fact it was in the Muslims' interests, because it gave the
kci$rs a sense of security and they were unprepared for a sudden
attack by the Muslims. They could not carry with them all that they
wanted when they ran away. The Sahibah were greatly cheered by
this dream of a righteous man, and it was a factor that encouraged
them to go ahead. They thought positively of Allah and considered
good dreams as a means of support from Him. The Muslim leaders at
the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs were, for the most part,
decisive men who made the most of every opportnnity to motivate
their troops with their enthusiasm and strength of faith. So Sa'd (4)
ordered his army to cross over to the enemy with the weapons of
sincerity and piety, content with his troops' level of faith. So he went
ahead, relying upon the help of Allah, then upon the high level of
faith among his men. The Sahcibah and the Tcibi'een who were with
them were characterized by their complete obedience to their leaders.
They regarded this obedience as a shar 'i obligation and a righteous
deed through which they drew closer to ~ l l a h . " ~

2.6.4. Crossing the river and the conquest of al-MadVin
Sa'd told the people to cross the river, saying, "Who can
protect the east side of the river, so that the people may cross safely?"

218

The Conquests of Iraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

He delegated 'Asim ibn 'Amr at-Tameemi, who was a strong and
tough man, to protect it, and he sent with him six hundred elite
troops, putting '&im in charge of them. He marched with them until
they reached the bank of the Tigris, then he said: "Who will come
with me to defend the river bank kom your enemy, and we mll
protect you until you have crossed?" Sixty strong men joined him
and they crossed the Tigris, and the rest of the six hundred followed
them. Thus kom the Muslun army was formed an elite group
numbering six hundred who were h o w n as the Ahwil squadron.
From them 'Asim selected svtty men under his own leadership to
f o m the vanguard of this group. This was wise planning, first on the
part of Sa'd, then '&im, because facing difficulties and taking risks
cannot be done by a large number, rather it should be done by the
strongest and toughest who have the best fighting skills, even if they
are few. If others who were less qualified and less courageousjoined
this group then retreated when the enemy attacked, this would cause
the defeat of the entire group.190
'&im crossed the river with sixty men on horseback. It is
reported that the scouts who went on ahead to the other side were:
Asamm Bani Walls at-Teemi, al-Kalaj ad-Dabbi, Abu Mufazzir alAswad ibn Qutbah, Sharabeel ibn as-Sam al-Kindi, Hajl al-'Ajli,
M%k ibn Ka'b al-Hamad%ni and a young man kom Banu al-Hirith
ibn Ka'b. When the Persians saw them, they prepared horsemen to
fight them, and they met near the eastern bank of the river. '&im
said, "Spears, spears!" and directed them to aim them at their eyes.
They met in battle and the Muslims aimed at their eyes. The Persians
fled towards the riverbank with the Muslims stabbing at their horses
with their spears to make them run away faster. They started
galloping away and their riders could not control them. The Muslims

19'

At-Tdreekh al-Isldmi, 111168

'Umar ibn al-Khagtb

21 9

pursued them and killed most of them; those who got away fled oneeyed. Then the rest of the six hundred caught up with their brothers
and they took control of the eastern bank of the river.lgl

2.6.5. The Muslims cross the-river
When Sa'd saw that 'Asim had gained control of the
riverbank, he gave the people permission to cross the river. He said:
"Say, 'We seek the help of AUah and we put out trust in Him. Allah is
Sufficient for us and He is the best Disposer of affairs. There is no
power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the
Almighty'." Most of the army crossed over on horseback, with the
horses wading deep in the foaming and black water of the Tigris and
the people chatting as they used to chat whilst travelling on land.19z
The one who was havelling alongside Sa'd in the water was Salmin
al-FGsi, and the horses started swimming with them on their backs,
and Sa'd was saying: "Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the best
Disposer of affairs. Allah will most certainly grant victory to His
liiends and will support His religion. Allah will defeat His enemies
so long as there is no transgression or sin among the army that
outweighs their good deeds."193 Sahnin said to him:"Islam is new
and by Allah the rivers and seas have been subjugated to them as the
land is subjugated. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of S a M ,
people will leave (Islam) in crowds just as they entered it in

(4)

What Salm&~
meant by saying, "Islam is new" is that it
was still alive and its followers were strong in faith and proud of it.

Islam was the focal point of their lives for which they lived and died;
they called people to it and they defended it. But later on there would
come generations who would inherit this religion and would not be
Muslims by choice, and it would not be the focal point of their
concerns and feelings, rather all their concern would be focused on
worldly achievements and enjoying the pleasures of this world; Islam
would become a secondary concern in their lives. At that point they
would go out of Islam in crowds just as they had entered it in
crowds.195
The Muslims all crossed the river safe and sound, with no
harm coming to anyone. No one fell in the river except a man from
the tribe of Biriq who was called Gharqadah, who fell from the back
of a palomino horse. Al-Qa'qi' ibn 'Amr turned his horse around to
go and help him, and he held on to his arm until he brought him
across the river. The Biriqi, who was one of the toughest of men,
said: "Sisters are no longer able to give birth to sons like you, 0'
Qa'qi'!" He was a maternal uncle of al-Qa'qa .196
A'

The Persians were amazed when the Muslims crossed the
river, and Yazdagird fled, heading for Hulwh. The Muslims entered
the city unopposed, and Sa'd stayed in the white palace, which he
took as a place of prayer and recited the verses:
(How many of gardens and springs that they pir'awn's (Pharaoh's)
people] left behind, and green crops [fields] and goodly places, and
comforts of life wherein they used to take delight! Thus [it was]! And
(Qur'an 44: 25-28)
We made other people inherit them.b
And he prayed eight rak'ahs, the prayer of victory

2.6.6. Examples of the Muslims' honesty
"I praise Allah and I am content with His reward
When the Muslims arrived in al-M&in and gathered their
plunder, a man came with something which he gave to the one who
was in charge of the plunder. He and the one who was with him said:
"We have never seen anything like this, we have never gotten
anything like this or anything that even comes close." They asked,
"Did you take anything from it?" He said, "By AUah, were it not for
Allah, we would not have brought it to you." They realized that this
man was of good caliber and said, "Who are you?" He said, 'mo, by
Allah, I will not tell you lest you or anyone else praise me. But I
praise Allah and am content with His reward." A man followed him
until he went back to his companions, then he asked about him and

found out that he was 'h

'Avmah ibn al-Hirith e a b b i said: "I went out with those
wbo went out seeking booty, and I followed a well-travelled path
where I saw a man on a donkey. He ran away and caught up with
another one who was in front of him. They twned and ran with their
donkeys until they came to a river where the bridge was broken. They
stayed there until I caught up with them, then they parted. One of
them threw something at me so I chased him and killed him, and the
other one ran away. I went back to the two donkeys and brought them
to the one who was collecting the plunder. He looked at what the first

222

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

one was carrying and there were two saddlebags. In one was a horse
made of gold with a saddle of gold and a bridle of rubies and
emeralds set in silver, and reins of similar fashion. And there was a
knight made of silver, studded with jewels. In the other bag there was
a camel of silver on which was a saddle of gold and reins of gold. All
of that was adorned with rubies, and on it was a man made of gold
studded with gems. Chosroes used to keep them in the columns in his
palace on which their history was engraved.200

The goodness of al-Qa'qi' ibn '&im
Al-Qa'qC caught up with a Persian and lulled hm. He had
with him two boxes and two bags. In one of the two boxes there were
five swords and in the other there were sur. These were the swords of
the Persians and the kings with whom the Persians had fought wars.
Among them were the sword of Chosroes and the sword of Heraclius.
In the two bags were some shields that had belonged to kings,
including the shield of Chosroes and the shield of Heraclius. He
brought them to Sa'd, who said: "Choose one of these swords," so he
chose the sword of Heraclius, and he gave him the shield of Bahrgm.
The rest of them he gave to the al-Kharsa' squadron which was led by
al-Qa'qC, except for the swords of Chosroes and an-Nu'&, which
he decided to send to 'Umar so that the Arabs would hear about that,
because they knew of these two men."'

The Sahiibah's praise for the members of the army
The senior Sahdbah praised that army, as when Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqq& said: "By Allah, this army is honest. Were it not that the
virtue of the people of Badr is already established, I would have said
that they were better than the people of ~ a d r . " " ~

Jiibir ibn 'Abdull2h said: "By Allah, besides Whom there is no
other god, we have not seen anyone among the people of alQidisiyah who prefers this world over the Hereafter. We were
suspicious about three men, then we realized that we were wrong
when we saw that their honesty and asceticism were matchable."
They were: Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid, 'Amr ibn Ma'di Yakrb and
Qays ibn al-Makshooh.
Greater than that was the praise of the caliph 'Umar (&)
himself, when he saw the khum from that booty, among which were
the sword, belt and adornments of Chosroes. He said: "The people
who sent this are indeed honest." 'Ali
said: "You were honest
so the people were honest; had you been dishonest, they would have
been dishonest."203

(4)

'Umar's attitude tmards this amazing booty
Following the battle of al-Q%disiyah, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas
sent the cloak, sword, belt, bracelets, pants, shirt, crown and slippers
of Chosroes to 'Umar; these were made of fine and expensive
materials such as silk, gold and jewels. 'Umar looked at the people,
and the tallest and most well-built of them was Sur2qah ibn M%l&ibn
Jath'am. He said: "0' SurQah, stand up and put this on." Suriqah
said, "I was hoping to keep it, so I got up and put it on." 'Umar said,
"Walk over there," so he walked away. Then he said, "Come back"
so he came back. Then he said, "Good, good. A Bedouin from
Madlaj wearing the cloak, pants, sword, belt, crown and slippers of
Chosroes. What a day, 0' S d q a h , when you are wearing the clothes
of Chosroes and his family. What a great honour for you and your
people. Take them off." So he took them off, and 'Umar said: "0'
Allah, You withheld this from Your Messenger and Prophet, who was
dearer to You than me and more honoured by You than me, and You

224

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

withheld it from Abu Bakr, who was dearer to You than me and more
honoured by You than me, and You have given it to me. I seek refuge
in You lest You have given it to me in order to test me." Then he wept
until those who were with him felt sorry for him. Then he said to
' A b d u r - R b h ibn 'Awf, "I urge you to sell it and divide it before
evening comes."204

2.7. The battle of Jaloola'
The Persians gathered at a crossroads where routes to different
cities met, in Jaloola'. They started complaining to one another and
said: "If you separate you will never be united. This is the place from
which we are going to depart. Let us umte against the Arabs and fight
them. If we win, then this is what we want; if the outcome IS
otherwise, then we will have done our best." So they united under the
leadership of Ma@n ar-R&I. They dug a ditch around their city and
surrounded it with wooden spikes, except for the routes that they
used to use.
Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqb wrote to 'Umar informing him of that,
and 'Umar wrote back ordering Sa'd to send Hishim ibn 'Utbah ibn
Abi Waqq2~to Jaloola' with twelve thousand men, putting al-Qa'q2
ibn 'Amr at-Tameemi in charge of the vanguard, Mas'ar ibn M i l k in
charge of the right flank, 'Amr ibn Milik ibn 'Utbah in charge of the
left flank, and 'Umar ibn Murrah al-Juhani in charge of the rearguard.
Hishim went to them with his army and besieged them. The Persians
held out for a long time, only coming out to them when they wanted
to, and they engaged the Muslims in eighty skirmishes. But Allah
gave the Muslims the upper hand and they defeated the mushrikeen,
driving them onto the wooden spikes that they had set up to prevent

'Umar ibn al-Khagrib

225

the Muslims from advancing. Then the enemy prepared spikes of
iron. Sa'd started sending horsemen as reinforcements. When the
situation had gone on too long and the Persians were suffering
because of the Muslims' patience, they decided to attack, so they
came out to fight. Sa'd said: "Strive your utmost for the sake of
Allah, so that you might attain the fullest reward and booty. Strive for
the sake of Allah." They met and fought, and Allah sent against them
a wind that made everything turn dark, so they had no choice but to
stop fighting and retreat. Their horses started falling in the ditch, and
they had no choice but to fill in the part of the ditch that was nearest
to them so that the horses could climb out. Thus they spoiled their
own fortification^.^^^
When the Muslims heard that the enemy had filled in part of
the ditch, they said, "Let us charge at them again so that we may enter
upon them or else die trying." When the Muslims attacked again,
they lay iron spikes down around the ditch so that the horses would
not advance towards them, and they left a space where they could
come out and attack the Muslims. They fought fiercely, a battle the
like of which they had not fought except on the night of al-Hareer,
during the campaign of al-Qidisiyah, but it was a shorter and quicker
battle. Al-Qa'qiY ibn 'Amr ended up at the gate near the place where
the ditch had been filled in, so he seized the gate and ordered
someone to cry out, "0' Muslims, your commander has entered the
ditch of the people and seized it. Come to him and do not let those
who are between you and him prevent you &om entering it." He
issued this command in order to strengthen the Muslims. So the
Muslims attacked, and they were in no doubt that Hishim was there.
No one could stop them until they reached the gate by the ditch,
where they found that al-Qa'q? ibn 'Amr had seized it, and the
mushrikeen had started to flee right and left from the gate where their

226

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

ditch was. They died in a tactic prepared by the Muslims, losing their
horses to the iron spikes that they had prepared for the Muslims, and
ending up as foot soldiers. The Muslims pursued them, not sparing
any but the most insignificant of them. On that day Allah killed one
hundred thousand of them and the ground was strewn with the
bodies of the slain.206

2.7.1. "Our army made us talk
because of their deeds''
Sa'd ibn Abi Wqq@ sent Ziykl ibn Ubayh with the financial
account to 'Umar. Ziyid was the one who kept records of the troops.
When he came to 'Umar he spoke to him about what he had brought
and described it to him. 'Umar said: "Can you stand up and tell the
people what you have told me?" So he stood up and told the people
of the victories they had won and what they had done, and how they
had penetrated deeply into the enemy's land. 'Umar said, "This is an
eloquent speaker." Z i y a said, "Our army made us talk because of
their deeds."

2.7.2. 'Umar's attitude concerning the booty of Jaloola'
The battle of Jaloola' ended in victory for the Muslims, and
they collected a huge amount of booty. They send the khum to the
caliph 'Umar (&), who said when he saw it: "By Allah, this should
not be kept under any roof until I divide it." 'Abdur--Sn
ibn
'Awf and 'Abdulla ibn Arqam spent the night guarding it in the
courtyard of the mosque. The following morning, 'Umar came with
the people and took the covers offthe booty. When he saw the rubies,
emeralds and jewels he wept. 'Abdur-Ra@in said to him, "Why are

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

227

you weeping, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen? By Allah, this is a time for
giving thanks." 'Umar said, "By Allah, that is not why I am weeping,
but Allah never gives this to a people but they start to envy one
another and hate one another, and if they start to envy one another
that will cause enmity and division among them."207
This is a kind of intuition that is based on faith, for the believer
who has deep faith sees the consequences of what is happening in
such a way that never even crosses the mind of anyone else. His fear
for the believers lest they be affected by worldly matters in such a
way that they become alienated from one another has a great impact
on him and makes his tears flow in front of people. It is amazing that
tears would flow fiom a man who had achieved such power that all
people feared him, Muslims, krifirs and hypocrites alike, but this is
the compassion with which Allah (&) has adorned the hearts of the
believers, so that they become as Allah has described them:
(Mnhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him
are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You
see them bowing and falling down prostrate [in prayer], seekimg
Bounty fiom Allah and [His] Good Pleasure. The mark of them [i.e.
of their Faith] is on their faces [foreheads] from the traces of
prostration [during prayers]. This is their description in the Tmrit
[Torah]. But their description in the Injeel [Gospel] is like a [sown]
seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes
thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He
may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those
among them who believe [i.e. all those who follow Islamic
Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of
Resurrection] and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty
(Qur'an 48: 29)
reward [i.e. Paradise].)

2.8. The conquest of Ramhormuz
The Persians had started to regroup yet again at the incitement
of their king Yazdagird. They gathered in Ramhormuz under the
leadership of al-Hormwh. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& informed the caliph
of their gathering, and he ordered him to prepare an army from the
people of Koofa under the leadership of an-Nu'min ibn al-Muqamn.
He also ordered Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari to prepare an army from
Bqra under the leadership of Sahl ibn 'Adiyy. When the two armies
met, Abu Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm was to assume leadership of both,
and everyone who came to him would be counted as reinforcements
for him.
An-Nu'min ibn Muqamn set out with the people from Koofah, and
headed to meet a l - H o r m h , who was in Ramhormuz. When alHormuzk heard that an-Nu'min was headed his way, he wanted to
attack, hoping to isolate an-Nu'& with the support of the Persians
who had started to join him. An-Nu'min and al-Hormuzh met in
Arbak, where they fought intensely. Allah caused an-Nu'min to
defeat al-Hormuzin, who evacuated Ramhormuz and fled to Tastar.
Meanwhile, Sahl ibn 'Adiyy came with the people from Bqra,
heading for Ramhormuz. News of the battle reached them in Sooq alAhwk, and they heard that a l - H o r m had
~ run away to Tastar, so
they headed for Tastar as did an-Nu'min with the troops from
~oofah.~O~

2.9. The conquest of Tastar
The army of an-Nu'min ibn Muqarrin and the army of Sahl
ibn 'Adiyy reached Tastar, where they united under the leadership of

II

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

229

Abu Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm. Abu Sabrah asked 'Umar for
reinforcements, and he sent Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari who become the
leader of the army from Bqrah, and Abu Sabrah carried on as
commander of the entire army. The Muslims besieged Tastar for
several months, during which they faced the enemy in eighty battles.
The heroism of the champions became apparent in single combat,
and several of them became famous for killing one hundred in single
combats, apart kom those whom they killed during the battles
themselves. Among them were: al-Bar2 ibn Milik, Majza'ah ibn
Thawr, Ka'b ibn Soor, and Abu Tameemah from among the people of
Bqra. Among the people from Koofah were: Habeeb ibn Qurrah,
Rab'i ibn ' h r , and ' h r ibn 'Abdulla a l - ~ s w a d . ~ ~ ~
During the final battle, the Muslims met their enemies and the
fighting grew intense. The Muslims called out to al-Bar%'ibn Mil&
saying, "0' Bar2, urge your Lord to defeat them for us." He said,
"0' Allah, defeat them for us, and make me a martyr." Then the
Muslims continued fighting and defeated their enemy, forcing them
to cross their own trenches and pursuing them. When the going got
too tough for the Persians and they could no longer bear the siege,
two of them made contact with the Muslims independently of one
another and told them that the way to conquer the city was through
the place where water came out. This news reached an-Nu'& ibn
Muqanin and he urged his companions to do something. The heroes
of the armies of Koofah and Bqra met in that place at night, and
entered the city thereby. Then they said takbeer and those who were
on the outside also said takbeer. They opened the gates and destroyed
the troops who had been guarding them after a little resistance.'1°

came after the Muslims had won the battle and al-Hormuz2q the
Persian commander, had fled to the citadel. The Muslims who had
entered via the water-way encircled the citadel, and when they saw
him they rushed towards him, but he said to them, "What do you
want? You may think that I am cornered, but I have in my quiver one
huudred arrows, and by Allah you will never be able to reach me so
long as I have one arrow left, and not one arrow will miss its target.
What is the point of taking me captive if I give you one hundred
casualhes, dead or wounded?" They asked, "What do you want?" He
said, "I want to put my hand in yours and go to 'Umar, and he can do
whatever he wants with me." They said, "We grant you that." So he
threw down his quver and let them take control ofhm. They put him
in chaius and kept an eye on him, and sent him to the caliph 'Umar
Then they took everything that was in the city of wealth and
stored goods, of which they shared out four-fifths, giving each
horseman three thousand dirhnms and each foot soldier one
thousand.z11

We learn the following fxom the campaign of Tastar:

"I would not like to have instead of that prayer
the whole world and eueything in it"
h a s ibn M Z i , the brother of al-Bar?, said: "I was there
during the siege of Tastar when dawn broke and the fighting
intensified, and they could not pray. We did not pray until af€er the
sun had risen, then we prayed. We were with Abu Moosa and AUah
(&) granted us victory. Anas ibn M%ik al-h&i said, 'I would not
like to have instead of that prayer the whole world and everything in
it.' "212

when the Prophet (@) said, cct'How many people there are who are
unkempt and dusty, wearing scruffy clothes and no one would pay
any attention to them, but if they were to adjure Allah to do
something He would fulfil it. One such is al-Bar? ibn ~ i i l ' i k . " ) ~ ~ ~ ~
Al-Bar? was a person whose du 'is were answered, and the
people knew that because of this hadith, so during this battle they
asked him to bray to Allah to defeat the enemy. Despite this great
praise fiom the Messenger of AUah (g),
al-Ba6' did not become
proud or arrogant, rather he remained the humble man who would
take great risks in battle that brought great results, without any
interest in becoming a leader. When he asked AUah to grant victory to
the Muslims, which would bring a great honour for them and for
Islam, he did not forget about himself, and he asked Allah for the
most precious thing that a believer whose faith is strong can ask for,
namely martyrdom. Allah answered his prayer, defeating the enemies
and granting him martyrdom on that day.214

2.9.1. The caliph 'Umar and al-Hormuz2n
Abu Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm, the Muslim commander in that
battle, sent a delegation to 'Umar (&), and sent al-Hormuziin with
them. When they entered Madeenah, they dressed al-Hormuziin in
his usual clothes of brocade woven with gold, and they put on his
head his crown studded with rubies, and put on his other adornments,
so that 'Umar and the Muslims could see b
i
m as he usually appeared.
Then they took him out to the people, looking for 'Umar in his house,
but they did not find him. They asked after him and were told that he
had gone to the mosque to meet a delegation coming from Koofah.
They went looking for him in the mosque, and did not see him. Wben

they came out, they passed by some children of Madeenah who were
playing. They said, "What are you looking for? Are you looking for
the Ameer al-Mu 'mineen? He is sleeping on the right hand side of the
mosque, using his burnous for apillow." 'Umar had gone to meet the
delegation &om Koofah, wearing a burnous. When he had finished
speaking to them and they had left him alone, he took off his burnous,
rolled it up to make a pillow, and went to sleep. They set off, with a
crowd of onlookers, and when they saw him they sat down near him.
There was no one else in the mosque, asleep or awake, apart from
him, and he had his stick in his hand. Al-Hormuzk asked, "Where is
'Umar?" They said, "That's him."
The delegation gestured to the people to be quiet, and alHormu&n listened to the people who were with him and asked,
"Where are his guards and gatekeepers?" They said, "He does not
have any guards or gatekeepers, or any scrihe." He said, "He should
be a prophet." They said, "He does the deeds of the Prophets."
'Umar woke up because of the noise made by the people, and
sat up straight. Then he looked at al-HormuzEn and asked, "Is this alHormuzrin?" They said, 'Yes." He examined him and what he was
wearing and said, "I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire, and I seek
the help of Allah." And he said, "Praise be to Allah Who has
humiliated this one and his supporters by Islam. 0' Muslims, adhere
to this religion, and follow the guidance of your Prophet
and do
not be deceived by this world, for it is all deceit." The delegation
said, "This is the ruler of al-Ahwiz, speak to him." He said, "No, not
until there is nothing left on him of this adornment." So everything
was taken off him except something that was left to cover him, and
they put a scruffy garment on him. Then 'Umar said, "Well, 0'
Hormuzrin, how did you see the consequences of treachery and the
punishment of Allah?" He said, "0' 'Umar, during the Jlihiliyah
Allah was not part of the dispute between us and you. We defeated

233

you because He was not with us or with you. Now that He is with
you, you have defeated us." 'Umar said, "You defeated us during the
Jihilzyah because you were united and we were divided." Then
'Umar asked, "What is your excuse for breaking the tnrce time after
time?" He said, "I am a h i d that you will kill me before I tell you."
He said, "Do not be afraid of that." He asked for water and it was
brought to him in a coarse vessel. He said, "Even if I die of thirst, I
cannot drink from such a vessel." Then it was brought to him m a
vessel that pleased him. His hand started shaking and he said, "I am
h a i d that you will kill me whilst I am drinking this water." 'Umar
said, "Nothing will happen to you until yon have drunk it." He
spilled it and 'Umar said, "Give him some more; do not let him be
killed and be thirsty at the same time." He said, "I do not need any
water. I just wanted to ensure my safety." 'Umar said to him, "I will
kill you." He said, "You granted me safety." He said, "You are lying."
Anas said, "He is tellmg the bxth, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, you did
grant him safety." He said, "Woe to you, 0' Anas, would I grant safety
to the killer of Majza'ah and al-Bari'? By AUah, you will find me a
way out or I will punish you!" He said, "You said to him, 'Nothing
will happen to you until you tell me,' and you said, 'Nothing will
happen to you until you drink it.' " Those who were around him said
something similar. 'Umar turned to al-Hormuzin and said, "You
deceived me, and by Allah I would not accept to be deceived except
by a Muslim." Then he became Muslim, and 'Umar allocated to him
a stipend of two thousand, and let him stay in ~ a d e e n a h . " ~

2.10. The conquest of Jundaisaboor
When Abu Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm had finished conquering the
land of al-Soos, he went out with his troops to Jundaisaboor, which

234

17re Conquesis oflraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

was being besieged by Zurr ibn 'Abdullih ibn Kulayb. They stayed
there, fighting and clashing with the enemy, until one of the Muslims
offered them security. The conquest of this city and that of Nahawand
were two months apart. The Muslims were surprised when its gates
were opened and the people came out with sheep for grazing and
goods for trading, and the people came out of the citadel. The
Muslims sent word to them, askimg what was going on. They said,
"You have granted security to us, and we have accepted. We will pay
the jizyah to you in return for your protection." They said, "We did
not do that." They said, 'We are not lying." The Muslims made
enquiries amongst themselves, and it turned out that a slave called
Malmaf, who was originally fiom that city, was the one who had
written to them. They said, "He is just a slave." They said, "We do
not know who among you is flee and who is a slave. We received this
offer of security and we are bound by it, we accepted it and we will
not change our minds. If you want to betray us, go ahead." So they
let them be, and they wrote to 'Umar telling h i of that. He wrote
back saying, "Allah has placed a great deal of emphasis on the
importance of fulfilling treaties, and you will not be sincere until you
fulfil your promises. If you are in doubt, then accept the deal and
fulfl the covenant towards them." So the Muslims fulfilled the
promise and left them alone.216
These examples show how the Muslims excelled over their
Efir enemies in the field of good attitudes. Undoubtedly this moral
superiority was one of the basic reasons that motivated the & f i r to
enter Islam in such huge numbers and with such al&ty?17

2.10.1. An-Nu'ibn Muqarrin
and the city of Kaskar
An-Nu'mh ibn Muqanin was the governor of Kaskar. He
wrote to 'Umar saying, "The likeness of me and Kaskar is that of a
young man with a painted and perfumed prostitute by his side. I
adjure you by AUah to relieve me of my post in Kaskar, and send me
to join one of the Muslim armies." So 'Umar wrote to him, saying,
"Go and join the army in Nahawand, and you are in charge of
them."z18

3. The Battle of Nahawand (The Conquest of
Conquests) - The Fourth Stage, 21 A.H.
The Muslims had been victorious over the Persian armies in
numerous consecutive battles, and they pursued the remnants of
those armies without giving them the chance to catch their breath.
Between their crushing victory in the battle of alLQ2disiyah in Iraq
and the decisive battle in Nahawand there were four years, during
which the Muslims achieved one victory after another. Their armies
would have gone on to put an end to the last remnants of the army of
an aging empire, were it not for the orders of the caliph 'Umar (&),
who told them to stop at the Zagharoos (Zagros) mountains and not
go beyond that point. Those orders were for the purpose of
reorganizing the army which was exhausted &om continual fighting,
and to organize the administration of the conquered regions.219
The defeats that the Muslims inflicted on the Persians one after
another, especially after al-Qi%siyah, made the Persians angry and

236

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Eme of 'Umar

resentkl. It seems that it was not enough to put a final end to their
resistance. Their leaders and commanders wrote to their king
Yazdagird, urging him to resume the fight, so he decided to do that.
He made preparations to go hack and fight the Muslims with
whatever he had left in his land of fortresses and strongholds. He
wrote to the people of the mountains, from al-Bib to SajisGn and
Khorash telling them to mobilize to meet the Muslims. He
designated Nahawand as the meeting-point, choosing it for the final
resistance and decisive battle because it was well protected,
surrounded by mountains on all sides and only accessible through
rugged and difficult mountain passes. The Persians gathered in this
city, where Yazdagird assembled one hundred and fifty thousand
fighters: thirty thousand from the area between al-Bib and Hulwin,
sixty thousand from the area between Khorasan and Hulwin, and a
similar number fi-om the area between Sajistan and Hulwin.
Yazdagird appointed al-Fayrazin in command of them.

A letter was sent to 'Umar, informing him of these
developments and asking for,his instmctions, explaining the situation
to him from all aspects. In Madeenah, 'Umar assembled the wise men
of the Muslims and consulted them concerning the matter, then he
decided to send an m y to fight the Persians in their last stronghold,
Nahawand. At that time an-Nn'mh ibu Muqarrin al-Muzani was the
governor of Kaskar, and he had written a letter to the caliph in which
he had said, "The likeness of me and Kaskar is that of a young man
with a painted and perfumed prostitnte by his side. I adjure you by
Allah to relieve me of my post in Kaskar, and send me to join one of
the Muslim armies."220 'Umar consulted his Shoora assembly and
decided to appoint an-Nu'mk as commander of the Muslim army in
Nahawand. The caliph drew up a plan to mobilize the Muslim army
in the following fashion:

al-Aswad ibn Rabee'ah and other Muslim commanders in alAhwk and other parts of Persia were to form reserve troops
that would distract the enemy

'Umar wrote to the governors and commanders with his
instructions, and he managed to mobilize an army of some thirty
thousand warrior^?^' The Muslim m y , under the command of anNu'& ibn Muqarrin, set off towards Nahawand, which they found
to be fortified strongly, surrounded by a deep ditch, in kont of which
were sharp spikes which formed an obstacle for the attackers, and
threatened to harm their horses by injuring their feet so that they
could not longer walk. The Persian army inside the walls of the city
was in a state of readiness. The army in Nahawand had been joined
by those who were not present at al-QZsiyah, and al-Fayrazib had
stationed archers at the points where the Muslims were expected to
attack so that they could shoot their arrows at them if they bied to
advance?22 The Muslim cavalry was faced with the spikes and the
ditch beyond them, and could not cross them, whilst the Persian
archers started to shoot at the Muslim troops who managed to get

'"Ibid.

near the walls. This carried on for two days. An-Nu'miin decided to
gather the top commanders of the army to study the situation, and
they reached the conclusion that they should adopt the following
plan, which was devised by T u l a y w ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi: "The
Muslim cavalry would go out and start a fight with the Persians,
provoking them to come out from behind their walls. When they
came out, the Muslim cavalry would move back before them, so that
they would think that they were retreating out of weakness and would
hope to score a victory and start to chase them. The Muslim cavalry
would pretend to be defeated, and whilst the Persians were outside
their walls and fortifications, other Muslims who had hidden in
camouflaged places would take them by surprise and ambush them
far away from their fortification^."^^^
An-Nu'nGn started to implement this plan, and divided his
troops up into groups as follows: the first group was the cavalry, led
by al-Qa'q2' ibn 'Amr; their mission was to deceive the enemy
according to the plan described above, by attacking the walls of the
enemy city and trying to start a fight.
The second group, under his own leadership, was to hide in
concealed places and wait for the Persians to reach them, whereupon
they would attack them and fight them face to face.
The third group was another detachment of cavalry, who were
the strongest force of the army. Their mission was to hide in
camouflaged places then attack the enemy forces from two sides.
An-Nu'min ordered the Muslims to stay in their hideouts and
not fight until he gave them permission."4 The Muslims obeyed this
command and waited for the signal from an-Nu'miin to attack. Al-

'"Tireekh at-Taban, 51114.

'Umar ibn al-Khagtrfb

239

Qa'qi' started to carry out the plan and succeeded brilliantly. The
Persians were astounded to find themselves surrounded by the
Muslim forces who were mowing them down. The mushrikeen
started fleeing towards their fortifications, but they fell into their
ditches and onto their spikes. The Muslims continued to pursue them,
wielding their swords against their backs, until thousands of Persians
fell into the ditch. Al-Qa'q2 pursued al-Fayraziin and managed to
catch up with him and iinish him off. After this battle, the Muslims
entered Nahawand, then Hamadhh, after which they went on to
complete their conquest of the rest of Persia without encountering
any resistance worth mentioning. After Nahawand, the Persians did
not regroup again, and the Muslims took over their land. Hence the
battle of Nahawand was known as "the conquest of conquests."225

In the battle of Nahawand the deep insight of 'Umar was made
manifest in several ways, such as his mobilizing Muslim troops and
preventing the enemy kom mobilizing; the caliph 'Umar (&) did
not stop at ordering his governors in Koofah, Bwrah and Arabia to
mobilize in order to fight the Persians, rather he ordered his
commanders in al-Ahwiz and the rest of Persia to prevent the enemy
kom mobilizing. He instructed Salma ibn al-Qayyin, Hamalah ibn
Muraytah, Zurr ibn Kulayb, al-Aswad ibn Rabee'ah and others to
stand guard at the border between Persia and al-Ahwiz, to prevent
the Persians kom joining the army that was being mobilized in
Nahawand. Thus these commanders guarded the border and
prevented reinforcements &om reaching ~ a h a w a n d . ~ ~ ~

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Erne of 'Umar

3.1. Appointment of commanders if
any commanders of the army died
During the battle of Mu'tah (8 A.H. / 629 C.E.), when the
Prophet &) appointed Zayd ibn al-Hkithah as commander of the
Muslims, he stipulated that if Zayd died, then Ja'far ibn Abi Glib
was to lead the people. If Ja'far died, then 'Abdulliih ibn Raw&&
was to take over. 'Umar did the same thing with regard to the battle of
Nahawand, when he appo~ntedan-Nu'min in charge oftbe Muslims;
if anything happened to an-Nu'min, then Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamin
was to take over, and if anything happened to Hudhayfah, then
Nu'aym ibn Muqarrin was to take over. An-Nu'min was
distinguished by his high level of leadership, which was manifested
in several ways, as follows:

3.1.1.Sending out scouts before setting out to fight
Before marching out with his army towards Nahawand, which
was twenty-odd parasangs away, an-Nu'&
sent Tulayhah ibn
Khuwaylid al-Asadi, 'Amr ibn Abi Salma al-'Anzi and 'Amr ibn
Ma'di Yakrib on ahead to scout out the route and find out if there
were any enemy troops in the area. The three men travelled for one
day and one night, then they came back and informed their
commander-in-chief that there was nothing to worry about between
here and Nahawand. This mission was akin to what is known
nowadays as reconnaissance, where any army sends out scouts to
check the route before proceeding. In addition to that, an-Nu'&
took all kinds of precautions when moving his army, keeping them in
a state of readiness to fight at any moment.

'Umar ibn al-Khattib

241

3.1.2. The trick to deceive the enemy
The trick which the Muslims used to deceive the enemy in
Nahawand was one of the most brilliant military manoeuvres that
have ever been used by any m y in history, ancient or modem. When
the Muslims found themselves unable to breach the fortified walls of
the city which was protected with ditches, spikes and skilled archers,
they realized that the siege would take a long time and would meet
with no success so long as the Persians inside the walls of the city had
enough supplies to hold out for a long time. So they decided to resort
to tricks aimed at drawing the enemy out so that they could fight them
outside the walls in a place that they themselves had chosen. What
happened was entirely in accordance with the Muslims' plan. They
drew the enemy out to the places that the Muslims had chosen for the
battle, hiding and then ambushing them in those places kom all
directions. So the Persians were taken unawares and panicked, then
feeling helpless they ran away. There is no better trick that an m y
could use to draw out the enemy and overpower them.227

3.1.3. Choosing the time of attack
The history books speak of the patience of an-Nu'mih ibn
Muqarrin and his genius in choosing the same time for attack as that
favoured by the Messenger of Allah &), which was just after
midday when the shadows begin to lengthen and the wind is blowing.
An-Nu'mh ibn Muqarrin attained martyrdom m this decisive battle.
When news of an-Nu'& reached the caliph he said, "Verily, to
Allah we belong and unto Him is our return." He wept and grieved
deeply, and asked about the martyrs, and was told some names that he
did not recognize. He said, "Those are the weak and oppressed

"'See: al-Fann al-'skhri al-hlrimi, 4. 295, 296

242

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

among the Muslims, but the One Who has honoured them with
martyrdom knows their faces and lineages; what does it matter
whether 'Umar knows them or not?"Z28
It is worth mentioning that among the booty of Nahawand, the
Muslims found two chests filled with precious jewels £tom the stores
of Chosroes. Hudhayfah, the commander of the army, sent them to
'Umar with as-Si'ib ibn al-Aqra'. When he brought them to him he
said, "Put them in the bayt al-mil, and go back to your division." He
set off, and 'Umar sent someone after him who caught up with him in
Koofah and brought him back.229When 'Umar saw him he said,
"What is this you brought to me? On the night that you departed, I
dreamt all night that the angels were dragging me to these chests that
were filled with fire, wammg me that they would brand me with fire
if I did not share them out. Take them away and sell them, and buy
provisions for the Muslims." So he sold them in the market of
Koofah.
May Allah be pleased with you, 0' 'Umar, for you followed in
the footsteps ofyour Prophet and&
granted you pride and dignity
and He granted pride and dignity to Islam and the Muslims. 0' Allah,
help us to follow in his footsteps and suffice us against the evils of
innovation.230
After the battle of Nahawand, the Persian leaders kom
Hamadhin, Tabaristb and Isfahan hastened to seek peace deals with
the Muslims, one after an~ther.'~'

4. Penetration of Persian Lands
- The Fifth Stage
After the Muslim victory in the battle of Nahawand, the
Persians could not offer any further resistance. 'Umar gave the
Muslims permission to penetrate deeply into the Persian lands, and
after Nahawand the Muslims reached the city of Jayy, which is also
known as sfa ah an.^^^ Afieter a lengthy period of fighting, they made a
peace deal with the Muslims and 'Ahdull21 ibn 'Abdullih wrote
them a document granting them peace and security. Thirty men fled
kom them towards Kannin and did not make a peace deal with the
Muslims. In 21 A.H., Abu Moosa conquered Qom and ashi in'^^,
and Suhayl ibn 'Adiyy conquered K d .

4.1. The conquest of H a m a m n
for the second time in 22 A.H.
When the Muslims had finished with Nahawand, they
conquered Hulwk and Hamadhin, then the people of Hamadhk
broke the treaty that they had made with al-Qa'q? ihn 'Amr. 'Umar
wrote to Na'eem ihn Muqarrin, telling him to march on Hamadhi2.n.
He went there and camped in a place called Thaniyat al-'Asl, then he
went down to Hamadhk, where he conquered the surrounding land
and besieged the city. They asked him for a peace deal and he made a
deal with them and entered the city with twelve thousand Muslims.
Whilst he was in Hamadhk, letters were exchanged between the
Daylam and the leaders of Azerbaijan, who gathered in large
numbers to fight Na'eem ibn Muqarrin. He went out to meet them,
accompanied by the Muslims who were with him, and they met in a

him kom Hamadhin to Azerbaijan, and he sent S a m & ibn
Kharashah after him. This was done on 'Umar's instructions, and this
Samm2k was not the well-known Sahribi Abu Dujinah. Bukayr and
his companions were met by Asfandiya ibn al-Farrnkhzidh before
Samm2kjoined him. They fought and AUah defeatedthe mushrikeen,
and Bukayr took Asfandiyidh captive. He said to him, "Is peace
dearer to you, or war?" He said, "Peace." Then he said, "Keep me
with you," so he kept him with him. Then he started to conquer
Azerbaijan, city by city, and 'Utbah ibn Farqad was moving parallel
to him on the other side of Azerbaijan, conquering it city by city.
Then the letter of 'Umar came, tellimg Bukayr to go to al-Bib. So he
appointed Samm% to take his place as the deputy of 'Utbah ibn
Farqad. 'Umar put all of Azerbaijan under the control of 'Utbah ibn
Farqad, and Bukayr handed Asfandiyidh over to him. Bahram ibn
Farrnkhzidh came to fight 'Utbah ibn Farqad, and 'Utbah defeated
him and B a h r h fled. When AsfandiyiW heard of that he said,
"Now there can be peace and no more war." So a peace treaty was
made and peace returned to Azerbaijan, and 'Utbah and Bukayr
wrote to 'Umar telling him the good news and they sent the khums to
him. When 'Utbah became governor of Azerbaijan he wrote a peace
treaty for its people.244

4.5. The conquest of al-Bsb, 22 A.H.
'Umar ibn al-KhatJib wrote a letter appointing Snriqah ibn
'Amr, who was known as Dhu an-Noor, as commander in charge of
this campaign, and he set out with his army as instructed by 'Umar.

When the vanguard of the army, 'Abdnr-reached the king who was there at al-Bib, who was Shahrabarb the
king of Annenia, a descendant of the king who had killed the

247

Children of Israel and conquered Syria in ancient times, Shahrabark
wrote to 'Abdur-asking him for protection. 'Abdur-Ralpn2n
granted him protection. The king came to 'Abdur--,
seeking
to give an impression that he was in favour of the Muslims and was
sincere towards them. He said to h i , "There is another man above
me, go to him." He sent him to SurQah ibn 'Amr, the commander of
the army, and he asked Su5qah for protection, so Surgqah wrote a
d o c v e n t to that effect. Then S d q a h sent Bukayr ibn 'Abdulliih alLaythi, Habeeb ibn Maslamah, Hudhayfah ibn Usayd and S a M
ibn Rabee'ah to the people of the mountains that surrounded
Armenia, the mountains of al-Lin, Tafileeses and Mooqh. Bukayr
conquered Mooqin, and wrote a peace treaty for them. During that
time the Muslim commander of that region, Surgqah ibn 'Amr, died
and was succeeded by 'Abdur-Rwan ibn Rabee'ah. When 'Umar
heard of that he approved and told him to attack the ~urks."~

4.6. The beginning of the campaign against the Turks
When 'Umar's letter reached 'Abdur-Rah2n ibn Rabee'ah,
ordering him to attack the Turks, he set out and passed al-Bib,
intending to do what 'Umar had commanded. ShahrabA asked
him:"Where are you going?" He said, "I am looking for the king of
the Turks, Balanjar." S h a h r a b d said to him, "Usually if we leave
them alone and they leave us alone we will be happy." 'AbdurRz&m2n said, "Allah sent to us a Messenger and promised us on his
lips that we would be victorious and would continue to be so." So he
fought the Turks and penetrated two hundred parasangs into the land
of Balanjar, fighting many battles. Then huge and terrifying battles
took place during the time of 'Uthrnh (&).246

4.7. The campaign of Khorasan, 22 A.H.
Al-&af ibn Qays advised 'Umar that the Muslims should
expand further in the Persian land and comer the Chosroes
Yazdagird, because he was the one who was inciting the Persians and
the troops to fight the Muslims. 'Umar ibn al-Khash gave
permission for that, based on al-&ats advice. He appointed al&af as a commander and told him to attack Khorasan. Al-&af
set out with a huge army and headed for Khorasan, intending to make
war on Yazdagird. He entered Khorasan and conquered Herat by
force, appointing S+& ibn F u l h al-'Abdi in charge of it, then he
headed towards Marw ~ h a h j k ' ~where
~ , Yazdagird was. Al-&af
sent Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullih ibn as-Sakheer ahead of him to
~ i s a ~ u ?and
~ ' al-Hikith ibn Hassin to ark has.'^' When al-&af
approached Marw Shahjh, Yazdagird left the city and went to Marw
~ o o d h . 'Al-&af
~~
conquered Marw Shahjh and stayed there.
When Yazdagird reached Marw Roodh, he wrote to K h i q h the king
of the Turks, the king of q-Saghd and the king of China, asking them
for help. Al-&af ibn Qays pursued him to Marw Roodh, leaving
Hikithah ibn an-Nu'& in charge of Marw Shahjk. Reinforcements

Yazdagird heard of that, he went to ~ a l k h . They

under the control of al-Alpaf ihn Qays, who appointed a governor for
each city, then he returned to Mgw Roodh and wrote to 'Umar,
telling him of the conquests that Allah had granted in the land of
Khorasan. 'Umar wrote to al-Alpaf forbidding him to cross the river
and saying: "Keep what you have gained control of in the land of
Khorasan."
When the envoy of Yazdagird reached those whose help he
was seeking, they did not care to help, hut when Yazdagird crossed
the river and entered their lands, then they had to help him because
that was the custom of Figs. Khiiqin went with him to Balkh and
then they camped at Marw Roodh, where al-Alpaf was. Al-Mnaf
came out with the people of Bqrah and Koofah who were with him,
all twenty thousand of them, and he heard one man saying to another,
"If the commander has any sense, he will stand at the foot of this
mountain, putting it at his hack, and with this river like a ditch in
front of him, so that the enemy can only come from one direction."
The following morning, al-&af ordered his troops to take up that
position, and this was a sign of victory and wisdom. The Turks and
Persians came with a huge and &arming number of troops. Al-&af
stood up and addressed the people, saying: "You are few and your
enemies are many, hut do not he dismayed.
(How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?
And Allah is with a$-Sebiroon [the patient])
(Qur'an 2: 249)."
The Turks used to fight by day and d-Ahnaf did not know
where they went at night. So one night he went out with one of his
scouts looking for Khiqin. When it was almost dawn, one of the
Turkish horsemen came out, wearing a necklace and beating a drum.
Al-&af went up to him and they fought and stabbed one another,
hut al-&af killed hi.Then he took the Turk's necklace and stood
in his place. Another one came out wearing a necklace and carrying a

drum. When he started to beat it, a l - b a f approached
him and killed
..
him, taking his necklace and standing in his place. A third one came
out and he killed him and took his necklace. Then al-Abaf hastened
to return to his army. None of the Turks knew anything at all about
that. It was the Turks' custom not to come out until three of their
out beating- a drum, one afier another. When the
mature men had gone
Turks came out they found their slain horsemen and the king K h Q k
regarded
this as a bad omen. He said to his troops: "We have been out
too long and these men have been killed in a place where this has
never happened to us before. There is nothing to be achieved by
fighting these people; let us leave." So they went back to their
C O U I ~ ~ T ? ~ ~

The Muslims said to al-&af: "What do you t h i i about
pursuing them?" He said, "Stay where you are and let them be." And
al-Alpaf was right, for it says in the hadith, cc"Leave the Turks alone
so long as they leave you alone. ,,)>253
(And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage: they
gained no advantage [booty]. Allah suiliced for the believers in the
fighting [by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops
of angels]. And Allah is Ever AU-Strong, All-Mighty.)(@r3an 33 25)

He was confused and did not know what to do or where to go.
Then he sent word to the king of Chma, seeking his help. The king of
China asked the messenger about the people who had conquered the
land and subjugated the people, so the envoy told him about them,
how they rode horses and camels, what they &d and how they
prayed. He sent a letter with him to Yazdagird saying, "The reason
why I did not send you an army the kont ofwhich would be in Marw
whilst the back was in Chma is not that I do not know what my duty
is towards you; rather it is because these people whom your envoy
described to me, if they picked a fight with the mountains they would
crush them, and if I came to support you they would defeat me, if
they are as your envoy described them to me. So try to make a peace
deal with them." Chosroes and his family went and settled in some
part of the land, humiliated and defeated, and he remained there until
he was killed during the caliphate of ' ~ t h r n i i n . ~ ~ ~
When al-Abaf arrived with a letter describing the victory and
the booty that Allah had bestowed on them flom the wealth of the
Turks and those who were with them, and how they had killed many
of them, and how Allah had driven back those who disbelieved in
their rage, and they gained no advantage, 'Umar stood up on the
minbar and the letter was read out before him, then 'Umar said:
"Allah sent Muhammad with tme guidance, and promised his
followers reward in this world and in the Hereafter, and He (&) said,
dIt is He Who has sent His Messenger [Muhammad] with guidance

Praise he to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise and granted victory
to His troops. AUah has destroyed the kingdom of Persia and

scattered them, and they no longer control even a handspan of their
land that could have any effect on a Muslim. Allah has granted their
land, houses, wealth and people as an inheritance to you, to see what
you will do. So adhere to His commands and He will fulfil His
covenant with You. Do not change, lest He replace you with another

the land of al-Balpyn @ahrain). They met the Persians in a place

the treaty and incited the Persians to do likewise. 'Utbmin ibn Abi al'As sent his son and his brother al-Hakam to fight them, and Allah

SSlriyah ibn Zunaym headed for Fasawdara Bajrud, where he
met a huge number of Persians and Kurds. The Muslims grew very
anxious, and that night 'Umar in his dream saw their battle and their
numbers; the battle was taking place in the daytime and they were in
a desert, and there was a mountain which, if they put it at their backs,
the enemy could only attack them from one direction. The next day

he gave the call, "q-Sakitu Jimi'ah (prayer is about to begin)," and
when it was the hour that he had seen the fighting in his dream, he
came out to the people, ascended the minbar and addressed the
people, telling them of what he had seen. Then he sad, "0' Sikiyah,
the mountain!" Then he turned to them and said: "AUah has troops
(angels) and perhaps some of them will convey it to them." And they
did what 'Umar said, and Allah granted them victory over their
enemies, and they conquered that land?57

sent a letter to 'Umar, telling him the news of the conquest. He sent
al-'Abdi. When he came
the letter, along with the k h u m , with S*
to 'Umar, he asked him about the land of M u k h and he said: "0'
Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, its land is mountainous, its water is scarce, its
dates are bad, the enemy is tough, its good is little and its evil is great.
Much there is a little and a little is wasted, and what lies beyond it is
even worse." 'Umar asked, "Are you trying to be a poet?" He said,
"No, it is just information.'' 'Umar wrote to al-Hakam ibn 'Amr,
telling him not to go beyond M d d n , and to stay on this side of the
river.Z61

4.12. The campaign against the Kurds
Ibn Jareer mentioned, with his isnad from Sayf kom his
Shaykhs, that some of the Kurds were joined by some of the Persians.
They gathered and were met by Abu Moosa in a place in the land of
Bayroodh that was near the Teera river.z62Then Abu Moosa left for
Isfahan, leaving ar-Rabee' ibn Ziyid to fight them after the murder of
his brother al-Muhqir ibn Ziykl. He took charge of the war and
throttled them, and Allah defeated the enemy, to Him be praise. This
is the way of AUah with His believing slaves, the followers of the
best of His Messengers. Then the khums was taken from the booty
and sent, with news of the victory, to 'Umar (&)?63 Thus Iraq and
Iran were conquered at the time of 'Umar (&). The Mnsllms
established strongholds throughout these regions, expecting a
backlash from the Persians m these lands. The conquest of the East
was very difficult and demanded great sacrifices on the part of the
Muslims, because of the differences in race. The inhabitants of Iran

were Persians who has no ties of language, race or culture to the
Arabs, and the national feelings of the Iranians were strong, fed by a
lengthy history and deeply-rooted culture. Moreover the fighting was
taking place in the Iranian heartland, and the Magian clergy played
their part in inciting the inhabitants to resist. In addition to that, these
regions were far away &omthe military centres of B a ~ r and Koofah,
and the land was mountainous which enabled the inhabitants to resist.
Hence most of the cities broke their treaties and were re-conquered
during the time of 'Umar or during the caliphate of ' ~ t h t n i n . ~ ~ ~

5. The Most Important Lessons We Learn

From the Conquests of Iraq and the East
5.1. The effect of verses and a@deeth
on the morale of the Muj&ideen
The verses and ahddeeth which speak of the virtue ofjihad had
an effect on the morale of the Mujdhideen. Allah states that every
action of the Mujdhideen will be rewarded. Allah (g)
says:
dIt was not becoming of the people of Madeenah and the bedouins of
the neighbourhood to remain behind Allah's Messenger
[Muhammad, when fighting in Allah's Cause] and [it was not
becoming of them] to prefer their own lives to his life. That is
because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger in the Cause
of Allah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor
inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a
deed of righteousness. Surely, Allah wastes not the reward of the
Mu!zsznoon. Nor do they spend anything [in Allah's Cause] -small

or great - nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit that Allah
may recompense them with the best of what they used to d0.B
(Qur'an 9. 120-121)

The early Muslims were certain that jihad is a successful
transaction. Allah (&) says:
(0' you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you
from a painful torment? That you believe in AUah and His Messenger
Nuhammad], and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah
with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for yo4 if you but
know! [If you do so] He will forgive you your sins, and admit you
into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in 'Adn
[Eden] Paradise; that is indeed the great success. And also w e will
give you] another [blessing] which you love, - help from AUah
[against your enemies] and a near victory. And give glad tidings [0'
Muhammad] to the believe.)
(Qur 'an 61: 10-13)

They lmew that jihad is better than taking care of al-Masjzd alHarcim and providing water to the pilgrims, as Allah (&) says:
(Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and
the maintenance of al-Masjid al-Harcim [at Makkah] as equal to the
worth of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive hard
and fight in the Cause of Allah? They are not equal before Allah. And
AUah guides not those people who are the @ilzmoon [polytheists
and wrongdoers]. Those who believed [in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism] and emigrated and strove hard and fought in
Allah's Cause with their wealth and their lives, are far higher in
degree with Allah. They are the successful. Their Lord gives them
glad tidings of mercy from Him, and His being pleased [with them],
and of Gardens [Paradise] for them wherein are everlasting delights.
They will dwell therein forever. Verily, with Allah is a great reward.)
(Qur'an 9 . 19-22)

1

'Umar ibn al-Khandb

257

They believed that jihad was a victory in all cases. Allah ( B )says:
(Say, 'Do you wait for us [anything] except one of the two best things
[martyrdom or victory]; while we await for you either that Allah will
afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait,
(Qur'an 9: 52)
we too are waiting with you.')
And the life of the martyr does not come to an end; rather he is
alive as Allah, the Exalted says:
4 T h i not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay,
they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision. They rejoice
in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty and rejoice for
the sake of those who have not yet joined them but are left behind
[not yet martyred] that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they
grieve. They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that
Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.)
(Qur 'an 3: 169-171)
They felt that the goal for which they were fighting was a
sublime one. Allah says:
(Let those [believers] who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter
fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah,
and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.
And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah,
and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women,
and children, whose cry is, 'Our Lord! Rescue us from this town
whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will
protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.' Those who
believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in
the cause of Tdghoot [Satan]. So fight you against the fiends of
ShayyGn [Satan]; ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaytcin [Satan].)
(Qur'an 4: 74-76)

258

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the lime of 'Umar

The Messenger @) explained to the Muslims the virtue of
jihad, and these ahrideeth motivated them greatly. Among these
ahrideeth is that which was narrated fkom Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri
(&,),who said: ccIt was asked, "0' Messenger of Allah, which of the
people is best?" The Messenger of Allah @) said, "A believer who
strives in jihad with himself and his wealth:"))265 The Messenger of
AUah (g)
explained the degrees of the Mujrihideen when he said:
ccC'In Paradise there are one hundred degrees which AUah has
prepared for those who strive in jihad for the sake of Allah. The
distance between two degrees is like that between heaven and earth.
If you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws, for it is the best part of
Paradise and is the highest part of ~ a r a d i s e . " ) ) ~ ~ ~
The Prophet @J explained the virtue of the martyrs when he
said: ccC'Allahhas promised those who go out (in jihad) for His sake,
(not going out for any reason except belief in Me and belief in My
Messengers, but I will bring him back with the reward and booty that
he has attained, or I will admit him to Paradise.) Were it not that it
would be too hard for my ummah, I would not have stayed behind
fkom any campaign. I wish that I could be killed for the sake of Allah
then brought hack to life, then killed then brought back to life, then
ki!.led."))267 And he @J said: cc"No one who enters Paradise would
like to come back to this world and have everything in it, except for
the martyr, who wishes that he could come back to this world and he
killed ten times over, because of what he sees of the honour that Allah
bestows upon him."))268

and those who followed the same path, based on these verses and

ahddeeth. The senior Sahdbah (may Allah be pleased with them all)
went out on campaigns even when they had grown old. The people
felt sony for them and urged them to stop fighting, because they were
excused, but they responded by saying that Soorah at-Tawbah would
not let them stop, and they feared that they might become hypocrites
if they stayed behind and did not go out to fight.Z69

5.2. The fruits of jihad for the sake of Allah
The Sahdbah and Tdbi'een during the time of the RightlyGuided Caliphs believed that jihad for the sake of Allah was one of
the necessities for the survival of the Muslim nmmah. They
undertook this obligation when conquering Iraq, the east, Syria,
Egypt and North Africa. Their undertaking of this obligation bore
many h i t s , such as qualifying the Muslim ummah to lead mankind;
putting an end to the power of the kuffcir, humiliating them and
instilling fear in their hearts; and making manifest the truth of their
call to mankind, which made the people enter into the religion of
Allah in crowds. Thus the Muslims increased in pride and the kuffcir
increased in humiliation. The Muslims united against their enemies
and they brought to mankind the blessings of the light, justice and
mercy of

5.3. Laws of Allah that were manifested in
the conquests of Iraq and the eastern lands

260

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the lfme of 'Umar

societies, people and states. These laws include the following:

5.3.1. The law of causes
Allah ( B )says:
h d make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds
of war [tanks, planes, missiles, artillery] to threaten the enemy of
Allah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know
but whom Allah does know. And whatever you shall spend in the
Cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you, and you shall not be treated
(Qur'an 8: 60)
unjustly.)
'Umar applied this verse during his reign, employing both physical
and spiritual means as we have explained above.

5.3.2. The law of checking people
by means of one another
Allah, the Almighty says:

6..And if Allah did not check one set ofpeople by means of another,
the earth would indeed he full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty
to the 'alameen [mankind, jinn and all that exists].) (Qur'an 2: 251)
This law was fulfilled by the conquest movement in general. This law
is one of the most important laws of Allah in creation, and is one of
the most important laws that have to do with consolidating the
position of the Muslim ummah. The early Muslims understood this
law and acted upon it. They knew that the truth needs resolve and
determination to support it, efforts to make it prevail, hearts to love it
and emotions to be tied to it. It needs human effort, because this is the
law of Allah in the life of this world and this is a consistent law.'"

'Umar ibn al-Khanib

261

5.3.3. The law of testing
Allah, the All-High says:

(0rthink you that you will enter Paradise without such [trials] as
came to those who passed away before you? They were amicted with
severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the
Messenger and those who believed along with h i said, 'When [will
come] the Help of Allah?' Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!)
(Qur'an 2 . 214)

Calamities and tests came during the conquest of Iraq, particularly in
the battle of the bridge of Abu 'Ubayd, when thousands of Muslims
were killed and their m y was defeated. Then they regrouped and
says:
achieved great victories over the Persians. Allah

(s)

(You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties
(Qur 'an 3: 186)
and in your personal selves...)
It may be noted that the way in which this verse states that the
Muslim ummah will be tested is stated in the most emphatic
manner.272This is the law of Allah with regard to faith and calling
others to faith: there has to be some calamity, some harm to wealth
and self, and it is essential to be patient and stand firm.z73

5.3.4. The law of Allah concerning
oppression and the oppressed

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the Erne of 'Umar

$That is some of the news of the [population ofl towns which We
relate unto you [O' Muhammad]; of them, some are [still] standing,
and some have been [already] reaped. We wronged them not, but they
wronged themselves. So their 8liha [gods], other than Allah, whom
they invoked, profited them naught when there came the Command
of your Lord, nor did they add aught to them but destruction. Such is
the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the [population ofl towns
while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful [and]
severe.)
(Qur hn 11 100-102)
The law of Allah is consistent: oppressing nations will be
destroyed. The Persian state had oppressed and wronged its subjects,
and had rebelled against the laws of Allah. So the law of AUah was
applied to them and AUah caused the Muslims to gain power over
them, and thus they were eliminated.274

5.3.5. The law of Allah concerning
those who live a life of l w t q
Allah, the Ever Watchful says:
(And when We decide to destroy a town [population], We [first] send
a definite order [to obey Allah and be righteous] to those among them
[or We (first) increase in number those of its population] who lead a
life of luxury. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word [of
torment] is justified against it [them]. Then We destroy it with
complete destruction.)
(Qurhn 17: 16)

In the commentruy on this verse it says: "When the time for its
destruction draws nigh, We command those among them who live a
life of luxury, their tyrants and their kings, to obey [Allah], then they
274

As-Sunan al-Ildhiyah fee al-Umam wa al-Jamd'df wa al-Afrdd, 4 . 119-

121.

'Umar ibn al-Khandb

263

transgress therein, thus deserving the punishment, so We destroy
them. Allah singles out for mention those who live a life of luxury,
although the command to obey is addressed to all the people, because
they are the leaders of evil and the chiefs of misguidance; what others
do of sin is due to their following these leaders and being encouraged
by them, so it is more apt that the command be addressed to
them."275
This law came to pass concerning the leaders of the Persians.

5.3.6. The law of Allah concerning tyrants
Allah, the Exalted says:
dVerily, your Lord is Ever Watchful [over them].)
(Qur'an 89: 14)

This verse is a warning to sinners in general; it was also said that it is
a warning to the kuffir, or a warning to sinners and others.276In
Tafseer al-&mbi it says: i.e., Allah watches each person until He
either rewards or punishes him.Z77It is clear from these comments of
the mufussireen on the verses that we have quoted above that the law
of Allah concerning tyrants is that He sends down the punishment
upon them in this world. This is a consistent law which happened to
the tyrants ofthe past and will happen to the tyrants of the present and
the future. None of them will escape the punishment of Allah in this
world, just as none of them will escape the punishment of AUah in the

ere after.^^^

The Conquests ofIraq and the East at the Time of 'Umar

The law of Allah concerning the tyrants and the punishment
that Allah has sent down on them in this world offer lessons fiom
which those who fear AUah and His punishment, and who know that
the laws of Allah are consistent and are not biased towards anyone
may benefit. Allah (&) says, describing those who understand His
law concerning tyrants, and aRer mentioning the bad end that befell
Pharaoh:
$So Allah, seized him with punishment for his last and h s t
transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for
whosoever fears ~1lah.B
(Qur 'an 79: 2 5 226)
Thus the Persian tyrants were also subjected to the law of Allah.

5.3.7. The law of gradual progress
The conquests of Iraq and the eastern lands were subject to this
law of gradual progress. The first stage took place during the time of
Abu Bakr, when al-Heerah was conquered under the leadership of
Khrilid ibn al-Waleed. The second stage began when Abu 'Uhayd
ath-Thaqafi took over leadership of the army in Iraq, and lasted until
the battle of al-Bnwayb. The third stage started when Sa'd ibn Ahi
Waqq% was appointed in charge of the jihad in Iraq and lasted until
just before the battle of Nahawand. The fourth stage started with the
battle of Nahawand and the fifth stage was when the Muslims
penetrated throughout the Persian lands. From the conquests the
Muslims leamed the importance of paying attention to the law of
gradual progress when working to support the religion of Allah. The
basis for the law is the idea that the road is long, so it is essential for
those who are working in the field of Islamic da 'wahto understand
this law. The consolidation of Islamic rule in Iraq and the eastern
lands did not happen overnight, rather it was subject to this law, by
Allah's will.

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

265

5.3.8. The law of changing oneself
Allah, the All-Compassionate says:
(Verily, Allah will not change the condition of a people as long as
they do not change their state themselves.)
(Qur'an 13: 11)
The Sahribah (may Allah be pleased with them) began the
conquests of Iraq and the eastern lands by applying this divine
principle with regard to the people who wanted to enter the religion
of Allah. So they started to teach the people according to the Book of
Allah and the Snnnah of His Messenger
instilling sound beliefs
and ideas, and sublime characteristics, in their hearts.

w),

5.3.9. The law of Allah concerning
sins and evil deeds
Allah, the Almighty says:
(Have they not seen how many a generation before them We have
destroyed whom We had established on the earth such as We have not
established you? And We poured out on them rain from the sky in
abundance, and made the rivers flow under them. Yet, We destroyed
them for their sins, and We created after them other generations.)
(Qur'an 6: 6)

Allah destroyed the Persians because of the sins that they had
committed, the most serious ofwhich were kuf. and shirk. This verse
speaks of an established m t h and consistent law: sins destroy those
who commit them, and Allah is the One Who destroys the sinners
because of their sins.279Allah enabled the Muslim ummah to gain
power over the Persians when they (the Muslims) fulfilled the

266

The Conquests oflraq and the East at the lime of 'Umar

conditions required for victory and acted in accordance with the laws
of Allah.

5.4. Al-&af
ibn Qays changed
the course of history
'Umar was adamant that the army should limit itself to the
conquest of Persia and he forbade them to penetrate deeply to the
east, especially after the defeat of al-Hornwin and the Muslim
conquest of al-Ahwk.
'Umar said: "The area between the two rivers and al-Ahwk is
sufficient for the people of Basra. I wish that between us and the
Persians there was a mountain of fire so that they could not reach us
and we could not reach them." He said to the people of Koofah: "I
wish that between them and the mountain there was a mountain of
fue so that they could not reach us and we could not reach them."
'Umar discussed this matter with the delegation, and a l - w f
said to him: "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, I was told that you have
forbidden us to go any deeper into the land, and you have ordered us
to limit ourselves to that which is already in our hands. But the
Persian king is still living amongst them and they will keep stirring
up trouble for us so long as their king is still among them. No two
kings ever meet until one of them expels the other. I think that we did
not conquer any land except as a result of their aggression. Their king
is the one who is inciting them and he will continue to do so until you
give us permission to penetrate their entire countxy and remove him
fiom his kingdom. Then the Persians will lose hope and will give

'Umar said to al-&af: "You are right, by Allah, and you have
explained the matter to me as it is." So 'Umar gave them permission
to penetrate throughout Persia. He came around to al-&af's point
of view and recognized its merit. So the Muslims penetrated deeply
into that land. Al-Alpaf was appointed leader of the campaign in
Khorasan, and other heroes among the Mujihideen took charge of the
campaign in other regions. 'Umar drew up the plan of war for them,
and supplied them with reinforcements from the r e d s 1

he first letter to reach Syria kom the caliph 'Umar ibn alKhatJib brought news of the death of Abu Bakr q-Siddeeq (&) and
the appointment ofi4bu 'Ubaydah as governor of Syria. In this letter
it said:
"Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, the successor of the Messenger of Allah @),
has died. Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. May
the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon Abu Bakr as-Sideeq, the
one who acted in accordance with the truth, the eujoiner of good, the
gentle, modest, quiet, easy going, fiiendly and wise. We seek reward
with Allah for the calamity of his loss and the calamity that has
befallen the Muslims. I ask Allah to protect us by means of piety and
His mercy. May He help us to obey Him so long as we live and admit
us to Paradise when we die, for He is able to do all things. We have
heard that you are besieging Damascus. I have appointed you as
commander of the Muslims. Send your raiding parties out towards
Homs and Damascus and other parts of Syria, and plan that as you
and the Muslims with you see fit. Do not interpret what I say as
meaning that you should expose your troops to danger or give the
enemy hopes of defeatingyou, mther send those whom you think you

do not need, and whoever you need with you for the siege, keep them
with you. Let one of those whom you keep with you be -lid
ibn alWaleed, for you cannot do without him."'
When the letter arrived, Abu 'Ubaydah called M u ' m ibn
Jabal and read the letter to him. The letter-carrier said: "0' Abu
'Ubaydah, 'Umar says to you: "Tell me about Yazeed ibn Abi
Sufiyh and 'Amr ibn al-'& - how are they and how is their
conduct? Are they being sincere towards the Muslims?" Abu
'Ubaydah answered 'Umar's envoy and he and Mu'%& ibn Jabal
wrote one letter to 'Umar, in which they said: From Abu 'Ubaydah
ibn a l - J m and Mu'idh ibn Jabal to 'Umar ibn al-Khasb:
"Peace be upon you. We praise Allah besides Whom there is no other
god. As far as we know, you take care of matters. Now, 0' 'Umar,
you have become in charge of the affairs of the ummah of
Muhammad, the red and the black. There come to you enemies and
friends, noble and ignoble, strong and weak, and every one of them
has some right of justice over you. So think of how you will handle
the matter, 0' 'Umar. We remind you of a Day when all the secrets in
people's hearts will be revealed and all concealed matters will come
to light, and all people will be subjugated to the Sovereign, the
Subduer, Who will subdue them by His might; the people will submit
themselves, awaiting His judgement, feanng His punishment and
hoping for His mercy. We have heard that among this ummah there
will be men who are outwardly brothers but inwardly enemies, and
we seek refuge with AUah fiom that. Do not misunderstand our letter
or take it in a way other than we intend it. Peace be upon you and the
mercy of ~llah."'

Discussion between M i d and Abu 'Ubaydah
(may Allah be pleased with them both)
Khilid came to know of the order to dismiss him from
command. He went to Abu 'Uhaydah and said: "May Allah forgive
you. The letter came from the caliph appointing you in command and
you did not tell me; you prayed behind me when you are the one who
is in charge." Abu 'Uhaydah said, "May AUah forgive you too. I did
not want to tell you that until you had heard it from someone else. I
did not want to interrupt your plan until you had completed it, then I
would have told you. It is not power in this world that I seek and it is
not for worldly gain that I strive. What you see will come to an end
and cease to be. We are brothers, carrying out the command ofAllah.
If a man's brother is appointed over him, it will not harm his spiritual
or worldly affairs, rather it is more likely that the one who is in charge
is closer to fihah and temptation or more likely to fall into sin,
because of what he is exposed to, except those whom Allah protects,
of whom there are few." Then Ahu 'Ubaydah gave 'Umar's letter to

hil lid.^
'Umar (&) replies to the letter of
Abu 'Ubaydah and Mu'2dh
When the letter of Abu 'Uhaydah and Mu'idh arrived via
Shaddid ibn Aws ibn Thibit, the nephew of Hassin ibn Thibit alAn~iri,'Umar responded to their letter, saying: "I praise AUah
besides Whom there is no other god. I urge you to fear Allah, for that
brings the good pleasure of your Lord and is the best that you can
gain for yourselves; this is what smart people are eager to attain for
themselves whilst helpless people are negligent. Your letter has
reached me in which you say that as far as you know, I take care of

272

The Conquests of Syrra, Egypt and Libya

matters. This is a kind of praise of me. You remind me that I have
become in charge of the affairs of this ummah, and that noble and
ignoble, enemies and friends, strong and weak, sit before me, and that
each of them should have his rightful share of justice. You are asking
me how I will handle that. There is no power and no strength except
with Allah. You wrote to me telling me to fear a Day that is
inevitable; the alternation of night and day wears out everythmg new
and brings near everything that is far and brings about everything that
is promised until they bring the Day of Resurrection, the Day on
which all the secrets in people's hearts will be revealed and all
concealed matters will come to light and all people will be subjugated
to the Sovereign, the Subduer, Who will subdue them by His mght;
the people will submit themselves, awaiting His judgement, fearing
His punishment and hoping for His mercy. You say that you have
heard that in this ummah there will be men who are outwardly
brothers but inwardly enemies. This is not the time for that; that will
happen at the end of time, when there will be hope and fear, when
people will hope and fear one another. Allah has appointed me in
charge of your affairs, and I ask Allah to help me and to protect me
&om going astray just as He has protected o t h a . I am a Muslim man
and a weak slave, except when Allah helps me. The position to which
I have been appointed will never change my character insha' Allcih.
All greatness belongs to Allah and His slaves have nothing to do with
it. Let no one among you say that 'Umar has changed since he was
appointed caliph. I base my actions on which I see as truth, and I
explain my position to you. If any man is in need or has been
wronged, I shall restore his rights with no compromise. Your wellbemg is dear to me and if you get upset with me it will be hard for me
to bear. I am responsible for that with which I have been entrusted
and I will deal with any situation by myself insha' Allcih and not
delegate it to anyone else. After that I will not seek help fiom anyone
but those who are trustworthy, those among you who are sincere

towards the people. I w
ill not entrust anything to anyone other than
them insha ' Alldh. As for worldly authority, everything that you see
will come to an end. We are brothers, and any one of us may lead his
brothers in prayer or may be in charge of him, and that will not affect
his spiritual or worldly interests. Rather the one who is in a position
of leadership is more likely to fall into temptation or sin, except those
whom Allah protects, and they are few."4

1.1.The conquest of Damascus
The conquests in Syria during the reign of 'Umar ibn alKhaeb (&) represent the second stage of conquests in this
direction, afier the conquests at the time of Abu Balcr. M e r the battle
of Yarmook when the Byzantines were defeated, Abu 'Ubaydah ibn
al-.I&
appointed Basheer ibn Ka'b al-Himyari in charge of alYarmook. He heard that the defeated Byzantines were gathering in
F$l and that reinforcements had reached Damascus fiom Homs. He
did not know whether to start with Damascus or F$l which was in
Jordan, so the commander Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jan?& wrote to the
caliph 'Umar ihn al-Khanib (&), asking for his orders. 'Umar wrote
back: "Start with Damascus and head towards it, for it is the fortress
of Syria and the seat of their kingdom. But distract the Byzantines in
Fil$ by sending cavahy to face them and the people of Palestine and
Homs. If Allah causes us to conquer it before Damascus, that is what
we want, but if its conquest is delayed until Allah enables us to
conquer Damascus, then leave some koops to hold the city and take
your troops to attack Fihl. Once it is conquered, then go with Khilid

The Conquests of Syria, E~gyptand Libya

From the commands of 'Urnar we may note that he defined the
responsibilities of his commanders according to the principle of
economy of effort in addition to flexibility with regard to aims and
goals. We may also conclude from these orders that the first main
goal was Damascus, although a minor force was dispatched to F&l.
The second main goal was Fw, as the whole army was sent to
conquer it. The third main goal was Homs. In accordance with these
instructions, Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - J d sent fighting units to F&l,
led by Abu al-A'war as-Sulami ' h i b n Hatrnah, 'Amr ihn Kulayb,
'Abd 'Umar ihn Yazeed ibn ' h , 'Ammkh ibn as-Sa'q ibn Ka'b,
Safiy ibn 'Aliyah ihn S h b i l , 'Umar ibn al-Habeeb ibn 'Umar,
Labdah ihn 'h,
Basheer ibn 'Asmah, and ' A m M ibn Mukhshin,
who was the commander of these units, who headed towards F M . ~
Ahu 'Ubaydah set off towards Damascus, not encountering
any significant resistance. The Byzantines relied on the local people
in the regions near Damascus to block the advance of the Muslim
forces, but they had no real enthusiasm for mounting such a defence,
because of the had treatment that they had received fiom the
Byzantines, especially in the small villages.'
The Muslim forces reached the fertile oasis of Damascus
(Ghoo!at dimashq) where the palaces and houses of the Byzantines
were located, hut they found them empty because their inhabitants
had abandoned them and fled to Damascus proper. Heraclius sent
reinforcements from Homs to Damascus, scndiig 500 fighters8,
which was a smaller number than was required. The Muslim forces
whom Abu 'Wbaydah ibn al-J+
had placed to the north of

Damascus under the leadership of Dhu al-Kilii' confronted them and
a violent battle took place between the two sides, in which the

for help, and he sent them a letter urging them to stand firm and to
fight and resist, and promising them reinforcements. Thus their
resolve was strengthened and they withstood the siege.''

1.1.2. Description of the city of Damascus
Damascus was a great city that was named after its founder,
Dimshiq ibn Kin'k. It came under Egyptian rule during the
Eighteenth Dynasty. It is the oldest city in history and was a centre of
idol worship. When Christianity came to the city, they turned its
idolatrous temple into a church that was unsurpassed in beauty and
splendour, except by the church of Antioch. To the north of
Damascus lie the lands of al-Balqa' and to the south al-Joolin
(Golan), which is a mountainous region of arable and well-irrigated
lands. Damascus was an important commercial centre inhabited by
Arabs, and the Muslims knew it well because they used to trade with
it. The city of Damascus was a fortified city, surrounded by strong
walls built of stone six meters high and three meters wide, with
strong gates. Heraclius had increased its fortifications after the
Persians conquered it, enabling its gates to be closed firmly and
surrounding the walls with a ditch three metres wide into which the
waters of the Barad; river were allowed to flow. Thus Damascus
became a fortified citadel which could not easily be breached.'= This
shows us that the Byzantine fortifications of Damascus were very
strong. These fortifications indicate the following:
The fortifications of Damascus were not built in haste, because the
city was of strategic importance. The Byzantines feared that they may
lose it to the Persians, which meant that the efforts of Byzantine
military engineers played a role in organizing these defences,
utilizing engineering experience and resources that were not needed
elsewhere, in addition to the engineering howledge that was
available to the Roman army in this field.
The Byzantine engineering genius manifested itself in the
fortifications surrounding the city of Damascus, as the military
l6

Op. cit , p 180

278

The Conquese of Syria, Egypt and Libya

engineers took advantage of the topography in building these
fortifications, especially utilizing the Baradi river to fill the ditch
surrounding the city, in addition to other ways of using the landscape
to make it a natural harrier to block attacks corning fiom the north
and north-east.
The Byzantine leaders placed a great deal of trust in the
fortifications of the city, to such an extent that it made them gather
their forces and take up a defensive position there, waiting for the
Byzantine forces in Homs to regroup and engage the Muslim army.
This means that these defences that had been built by the military
engineers played a role in forcing the Byzantine commanders to take
up this defensive stance, thus they had a direct impact on decisionmaking. It is very important to understand the importance of military
engineering in battle.

On the other hand, these fortifications forced the Muslim army
not to attempt to breach the city of Damascus, because they formed
an obstacle. So the plan of the Muslim army was to impose a siege on
the city.
The historical sources say that the siege of Damascus lasted for
seventy days, and it was a harsh siege in which heavy weapons such
as catapults and siege engines were used."

1.1.3.The progress of the battle
Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jan@ set out for Damascus, organizing
his army in the following fashion:
+:* At the core: Khilid ibn al-Waleed
*:* On the flanks: 'Amr ibn al-'& and Ahu 'Ubaydah
" AI-Handarah ul-'Askariyuh, Pp. 190, 191

'Umar ibn al-Khandb

279

* Cavalry: 'Iyid ibn Ghanam
*:* Infantry: S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah

Since the walls of Damascus had gates which were the only means of
entering or exiting the city, the Muslims organized their besieging
forces as follows:
*:* At the eastern gate: under the leadership of Khilid ibu al-Waleed

+3 At the gate of al-Jibiyah: under the leadership of Abu 'Ubaydah
ibn al-Jam&
At the gate of Tooma: under the leadership of 'Amr ibn al-'As
*:* At the gate of al-Faridees: under the leadership of S b d b e e l ibn
Hasanah

*+: At the small gate (al-bdb as-sagheer): under the leadership of
Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyh

The Byzantines thought that the Muslims would not be able to
keep up such a long siege, especially in winter, but the Muslims were
men of deep faith and great patience who were able to withstand the
changes in weather. The Muslim leaders let the Muslims take over
abandoned churches and houses in the fertile oasis (al-ghootah) so
that the Mujrihideen could relax, and they rotated their troops on a
weekly basis, whereby troops at the gates would change places with
troops in the rear so that the siege could continue no matter how long
it took.''
But the Muslims did not stop there; they also continued to try
to find out more about the enemy and the nature of the fortifications.
Thus W i d ibn al-Waleed was able to choose sites to breach the
fortifications and enter the city of Damascus. He chose the best place

i

280

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

where there was a lot of water19 and made rope ladders that could be
used by the troops to scale the walls. Khilid ibn al-Waleed knew that
a son had been born to the Patriarch of Damascus and that the people
were gathered at the celebratory feast; the Byzantines were
preoccupied with eating and drinking and were neglecting their
duties, including the task of watching the front and the gates. When
evening came, Khilid ibn al-Waleed and his troops set out, led by
Khilid, al-Qa'q? ibn 'Amr and Madh'oor ibn 'Adiyy. They said,
"When you hear a takbeer at the walls, climb up to join us and head
for the gate."20
Kh2lid and his first group crossed the moat in two floating
vessels and reached the walls, then they threw up the rope ladders
and when they were firmly attached, al-Qa'q2' and Madh'oor
climbed up, then they fixed more ropes. Then the second group came
up and the first group went back down and went to the gate, where
they joined the soldiers who were with Kh2lid. They said the first
takbeer at the top of the walls, then the second group scaled the walls
and headed towards the gate, where they broke in with their swords.
Thus the Muslim forces entered the city of ~ a m a s c u s . ~ ~

Important lessons
W a s the conquest achieued by means of a treaty or by force?
The scholars differ as to whether Damascus was conquered by
means of a treaty or by force. Most of the scholars are of the view that
the matter was settled by means of a peace deal, because they are not
sure which came first: was it conquered by force and then the

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

281

Byzantines agreed to a peace deal, or was one part conquered by
means of a peace deal, then the other side was taken by force? Some
suggested that half of it was conquered by means of a peace deal and
the other half by force. This is more likely to be the case because
what the Sahibah did in the case of the main church which was the
largest place of worship, when they took half of it and left the other
half?3 And Allah knows best.

The date of the conquest
Ibn Katheer said: "The story narrated by Sayf ibn 'Umar
suggests that the conquest of Damascus took place in 13 A.H., but
Sayf also states the same as the majority, which is that it happened in
the middle of Rajab 14 A.H."'~ Khaleefah ibn Khayyit stated that
Abu 'Ubadah besieged the Byzantines in Damascus in Rajab,
Sha'bh, Ram*
and Shawwil, then the peace treaty came in Dhu
a l - ~ a ' d a h ?What
~
matters is that the conquest took place after the
battle of al-yarmookz6

Application of some principles of war
During the conquest of Damascus, the Muslims applied some
of the principle of war, including surprise, initiating the fighting,
making the most of opportunities and innovative thinking on the part
of field commanders. We have seen what Khilid ibn al-Waleed did
when he sent out scouts and looked for the best place to breach the
walls, and how that affected the situation and changed the siege into
an attack. If we compare what Khilid ibn al-Waleed did, using rope
ladders to climb over the walls of Damascus, with what the Egyptian
army did in the October War of 1973 C.E., when they crossed Israel's

Bar-Lev line and used rope ladders to reach the enemy's defensive
positions, we will realize that it was the same tactic. This
demonstrates to us the brilliance of the Muslims during the Islamic
conquests, and our modem battles are no more than an extension of
this brillian~e.~~
Conquest of other parts of Syria after Damascus
After the conquest of Damascus, Abu 'Ubaydah sent Khilid
ibn al-Waleed to al-Biqi' (Beki)28, which was conquered by the
sword. And he sent out a party which met with the Byzantines in
'Ayn Misnoon. The Byzantines were led by a man called Sinin, who
descended upon the Muslims from 'Aqabat Beirut. A number of
Muslim were lalled that day, so 'Ayn Misnoon became known as
'Ayn ash-Shuhada' (the spring of the martyrs). Abu 'Ubaydah
appointed Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyin in charge of Damascus during his
absence, and Yazeed sent D&yah ibn Khaleefah to Tadmnr with a
detachment of troops to conquer it. He also sent Abu al-Zahra' alQushayri to al-Bathaniyah and H a d , where he made peace treaties
with their people. S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah conquered all of Jordan by
force, except Tabariyah (Tiberias) with whose people he made a
peace treaty. Khilid took over the land of al-Biqi', and the people of
Ba'labak (Bilbek) asked him for a peace treaty, and he wrote a
document for them.

The troops whose job it was to attack the city of Fihl headed
towards the south. When they drew near to the city, the Byzantine

forces numbered nearly one hundred thousand, most of whom had
come from Homs and were joined by troops from other cities that had
been defeated in previous battles. When the Muslim troops who were
to besiege F a under the leadership of 'Ammi2 ibn Mukhshin
reached the city, they were confronted by the Byzantines who dug
ditches from Lake Tiberias and directed the water to the areas
surrounding F a with the aim of blocking the Muslim army,
especially the cavalry. This is a tactic that is used nowadays against
armoured vehicles. Thus the Muslim cavalry was blocked, and the
Byzantines turned this mud into a defensive line that protected F&l
even though it is located on a flat plain. Ifthis plain had been dry,the
Muslims would have been able to attack the city easily, for they were
the most able of people in fighting desert battles. 'Am&& ibn
Mukhshin stopped and ordered his troops to besiege F a instead of
attacking it, due to the big difference in numbers between the forces
and the difficulty of attacking, as well as the inability to cross the
water barrier that the Byzantines had created. So the Muslims limited
themselves to imposing a siege on the city of F&l in which the
Byzantines were barricaded, until Abu 'Ubaydah bad completed the
conquest of the capital Damascus and was able to bring his army to
join the army of Abu al-A'war as-Sulami, whereupon Abu 'Ubaydah
reorganized his troops in the following manner:

*% General command of the troops went to S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah,

because the site of the battle was in the area that was under his

284

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

command. S h h b e e l ibn Hasanah took command then he
organized the troops and supply lines, and set out a plan to
keep them in an ongoing state of readiness, prepared to face
emergencies at any moment of day or night.zg
The Muslim siege of F*l lasted for a long time, and the
Byzantmes thought that they would be able to take the Muslims by
surpnse and launch a decisive attack on them by night. The
Byzantmes, led by Saqliib ibn Mkhr%q,attacked the Muslims who
rose up agamst them as one, because they were in a constant state of
complete readiness. The battle lasted until daybreak and then went on
all day, until night fell. When it grew dark, the Byzantines fled and
their leader was killed. The Muslims set out in pursuit and drove
them in their defeat to that muddy area that they had prepared for the
Muslims. For the attacking Byzantine army, chaos ensued, as the
defeated troops fell into the water bamer that they themselves had
made around Fihl. The Muslims pursued them and none of them
escaped except a few. The Byzantine force that had been besieged
was utterly destroyed, after whicb the Muslims continued with their
original plan, according to whicb they sent S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah
to Jordan and 'Amr ibn al-'AS to Palestine.
Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jam& and Kh2id ibn al-Waleed set off
for Horns, and when they reached Marj ar-Room there was a bloody
battle in which the plain was strewn with the bodies of the slain.
During this battle, the Muslims managed to apply an important
principle of warfare when the Byzantme vanguard engaged the
Muslim vanguard. When Toodhra realized that the vanguard of his
army had engaged the Muslim army, he turned around and headed
towards Damascus. When the Muslims realized what was happening,
they studied the situation and Abu 'Ubaydah decided to send a force,
29 Al- 'ArnaliyJt at-Ta'omrdiyoh wa ad-Dfd'iyah

'inda al-Muslimeen, p. 188.

'Umar ibn al-Kha@&b

285

under the leadership of Khilid ibn al-Waleed, to chase Toodhra and
attack him from behind, whilst Abu 'Ubaydah stayed where he was,
fighting the Byzantine troops. At the same time, the Muslim scouts
managed to find out the direction in which Toodhra was heading, so
the troops of Yazeed ibn Abi sufiy& intercepted him. As soon as the
fighting started between Toodhra and the troops of Yazeed ibn Abi
Sufiyin, W i d ibn al-Waleed launched a surprise attack on the
Byzantines from behind, and the forces of Toodbra were utterly
destr0~ed.3~

1.3. The conquest of Baysiin and Tabariyah
Abu 'Ubaydah and Khilid, along with their troops, set off
towards Homs as ordered by the caliph 'Umar, and Abu 'Ubaydah
left S h d h e e l ibn Hasanah in charge of Jordan. S h d b e e l ,
accompanied by 'Amr ibn al-'AS, went and lay siege to Bays&
where the people came out to fight him and he killed a large number
of them, then they made a peace deal with him on the same terms as
Damascus. He imposed the jizyah on them and the kharcij on their
lands. Abu al-A'war as-Sulami did likewise with the people of
~abari~ah.3'

1.4. The battle of Homs, 15 A.H.
Abu 'Ubaydah continued pursuing the fleeing Byzantines as
far as Homs, where he lay siege to the city. He was joined by Khilid
ibn al-Waleed and they intensified the siege, at a time of intense cold.
The people of the city bore it patiently, hoping that the Muslims

286

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

would go away because of the intense cold, but the Sahribah
exhibited a great deal of patience. More than one commentator stated
that among the Byzantines were those whose feet fell off in their
leather boots, whilst the Sahribah wore nothing on their feet but
sandals, but no harm came to their feet or their toes. Some of the
elders of Homs suggested that they should make a peace deal, but the
people refused, saying, our king is nearby. It is said that one day the
Sahribah said a takbeer that shook the city, and there was an
earthquake that cracked some of the walls. Then they said another
takbeer and some of the houses collapsed. The common folk came to
their leaders and said, "Do you not see what has befallen us and the
situation we are in? Why don't you make a deal with these people on
our behalf?" So they made a peace deal on the same terms as
Damascus, on the basis that they would give (to the Muslims) halfof
the houses, and the kharrij would be paid on the land and the jizyah
would be taken ftom individuals, according to their means. Abu
'Ubaydah sent the khums and the good news of the conquest to
'Umar with 'Abdulls ibn Mas'ood, and Abu 'Ubaydah stayed in
Homs with a huge army, along with a number of leaders such as Bil21
and al-Miqdid. Abu 'Ubaydah wrote to 'Umar telling him that
Heraclius had stopped the flow of w a t d 2 to al-Jazeerah, and that the
water appeared sometimes and disappeared sometimes. 'Umar sent
word to him telling him to stay where he was.33

them revolted against him. Khilid fought them in an intense battle,
and killed many of them. As for the Byzantines who were there, he
utterly destroyed them and killed their leader Min2s. The Bedouin
there apologized to hi,saying that this fighting was not their idea;
Khilid accepted their apology and left them alone. Then he headed
towards the city where they had barricaded themselves and Khilid
said to them: "Even if you were in the clouds, Allah would lift us up
to you or bring you down to us." And he kept besieging them until
Allah granted him victory. When 'Umar heard of what Khilid had
done in this battle, he said, "May Allah have mercy on Abu Bakr, for
he had more knowledge of men than me. By Allah, I am not
dismissing him because of suspicion, rather I fear that the people will
come to depend on him."35

1.6. The battle of Caesarea 15 A.H.
During the same year, 'Umar appointed Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi
Suiiyh in charge of ~ a e s a r e a and

Allah against them, and say a great deal, 'Ld hawla w a Id quwwata

there is no power and no strength
except with Allah, the Most High, the Almighty.' Allah is our Lord,
our trust, our hope and our Helper, and He is the best of helpers and
the best of supporters." So he went there and besieged the city, and
its people came out to fight on numerous occasions, the last of which
was a battle in which they fought intensely and Mu'iwiyah strove
hard against them, until Allah granted him victory over them. The
fighting did not end until nearly eighty thousand of them had been
killed, and the number was brought up to one hundred thousand with

those who fled from the battle. Mu'iwiyah sent news of the victory

and the khums to the caliph 'Umar (&).
Dr. 'Abdw-RaIpnin ash-Shuj2' thinks that the cities of Syria
fell to the Mujcihideen one after another because the Byzantines were
so low in morale that they never thought of resisting. So the cities of
Beirut, Sidon, Nablus, Lod, Aleppo, and Antioch all fell. Caesarea
was the last of the cities of Syria to be conquered at the hands of
Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Sufiygn, and that took place after the conquest of

1.7. The conquest of Jerusalem 16 A.H.
There was a Byzantine leader in charge of Palestine who was
called the Ar@hoon, i.e., the senior commander who was second in
command to the Emperor. This man was the craftiest and most
brilliant of the Byzantines, with the deepest insight and the most
treacherous nature. He had put a large number of troops in Ramlah
and Aeelia' (~erusalem)~~,
and 'Amr ibn al-'& wrote to 'Umar
informing him of that and asking h i for advice and instructions.
'Umar said his famous words: "We have sent against the Amboon of
the Byzantines the maboon of the Arabs. Let us see how things will
work out."40 And he meant it, for both leaders were the smartest
among their people. The second battle of Ajnikiayn in 15 A.H., in
which 'Arm defeated the Byzantines, paved the way to ~alestine.~'
The battle of Jerusalem began before the second battle of Ajnidayn

when the Ar@hoonof the Byzantines sent a large number of troops to
both Aeelia' and ar-Ramlah, as we stated above, in case of any attack
by the Muslims under the leadership of 'Amr ihn al-'As on these two
cities, which were the most important cities in Palestine; ar-Ramlah
was the capital of Palestine, and Aeelia' was its largest city and
between the two there was a distance of eighteen miles?2 The
Byzantines in Aeelia' were governed by the Amboon himself, who
had fled there with the remnants of his army after the defeat at
Ajn2dayn. Their governor in ar-Rarnlah was a t - ~ a d h i r i ~These

1.7.1. Distracting the enemy
The plan of the caliph 'Umar was to distract the Byzantines
from 'Amr in Palestine until victory was achieved against their troops
in Ajnidayn, so that after that the Muslims could concentrate on
conquering Jerusalem and the rest of Syria. He ordered Mu'zwiyah to
go with his cavalry to Caesarea, to distract its garrison from 'Amr.
'Amr himself followed a plan that was similar to the caliph's plan. He
sent 'Alqamah ihn Hakeem al-FGsi and Masrooq ihn Fulin alMakki at the head of a detachment to distract the Byzantine garrison
in Aeelia'; they went to Aeelia' and distracted the troops there from
'Amr.44Then he sent Ahu Ayyooh al-Miliki at the head of another
detachment to distract the Byzantine garrison in ar-Ramlah. As soon
as reinforcements reached 'Amr, he sent Muhammad ihn 'Amr with
reinforcements to the troops who were confronting the garrison of
Aeelia', and he sent ' A m m i d ihn 'Amr ihn Umayyah @-Dumari
with reinforcements to the troops who were confronting the garrison
of ar-Ramlah. He himself stayed in Ajnidayn, awaiting the decisive

battle with maboon. In the meantime, the garrison of Aeelia' was
wing to ward off the Muslims from the city walls, and the fighting
intensified around the holy city, whilst the Muslims and Byzantines
were mobilizing to fight in Ajnkbyn. The battle of Ajngdayn was
intense45, and at-Tabari says concerning it: "They - the Muslims
and the Byzantines -fought a battle that was as fierce as the battle of
al-Yarmook, until many of them were killed.46It was a showdown
between the &boon
of the Arabs and the &boon

Byzantines in Ajnzdayn. The Roman general was defeated and fled
with his troops to seek protection within the walls of the holy city,

that 'Alqamah, Masrooq, Muhammad ibn 'Amr and Abu Ayyoob all
joined 'Amr in AjrGdayn, and 'Amr marched with his entire army to
Aeelia' to lay siege to it.48
The Muslims gathered, under the leadership of 'Amr ibn alaround Aeelia', and 'Amr lay siege to the city. The city was well
fortified, and al-W+idi describes the walls of the city as being
fortified with catapults, swords, shields, and chain mail. He states
that the fighting began after a three-day siege, when the Muslims
advanced towards the walls of the city and the garrison rained down
arrows upon them, from which they protected themselves with their
shields. The fighting lasted from morning until sunset, and continued
in this manner for a number of days. Then on the eleventh day, Abu
'Ubaydah came to the Muslims, accompanied by Kh2lid and 'AbdurR b k ibn Abi Bakr, and the Muslim cavalry and the champions of

The siege went on for four months, and there was no day on which
fierce fighting did not take place. The Muslims bore the cold, snow
and rain with patience50, until the Byzantines despaired of resisting
the Muslim siege of their city. The Patriarch Sophronius decided to
stage a final attempt, and wrote a letter to 'Amr ibn al-'AS, the
commander of the Muslim army, urging him to lift the siege because
it was impossible for him to occupy the city5'

1.7.2. Surrender
The Byzantine &boon wrote to 'Amr ibn al-'AS saying:
"You are my fiiend and my counterpart; your position among your
people is like my position among my people. By Allah, you will not
conquer any part of Palestine after Ajnidayn, so go back and do not
be deceived, lest you be defeated like those who came before
'Amr wrote back to him, saying: "I am the one who is going to
conquer this land." He sent the letter with a messenger and ordered
him to tell him of the response of maboon. When &boon read the
letter of 'Amr he laughed at what was written in it and said, "The one
who is going to conquer Bayt al-Maqdis is a man called 'Umar." The
messenger told 'Amr what he had heard from Amboon, and 'Amr
knew that the man whom maboon had mentioned was the caliph.s3
He wrote to the caliph telling him what al-&boon had said, that no
one would conquer the city but him, and asking him for advice,
saying, "I am dealing with a very difficult situation and this land has
been saved for you to deal with, so what do you think?'"4 After
consulting others, the caliph set out for Syria with reinforcements,

after appointing 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) in charge of Madeenah in his

to him and made a treaty with him on the basis that they would pay
the jizyah, and they opened the city to him.55

1.7.3. Different reports concerning who besieged
Jerusalem and examination thereof
At-Tabari narrated more than one report concerning the siege
of Jerusalem which say that the one who besieged it was 'Amr ibn al'AS.Another report says that the reason why 'Umar came to Syria
was that Abu 'Ubaydah was besieging Jerusalem and its people
asked him to make a peace deal with them along the same lines as the
peace deals with other cities of Syria, and that the one who drew up
the treaty should be 'Umar ibn al-KhatjSb. So he wrote to 'Umar,
telling him about that, and he came from Madeenah after appointing
'Ali in charge of it in his absence, bringing reinforcements for the
troops in Syria.
Ibn al-Atheer narrated two reports that were very similar to the

reports narrated by a t - ~ a b a r i Al-W'riqidi
Jerusalem, including the consultation with the caliph 'Umar (&)
and the negotiation with the Bymtine garrison, to Abu 'Ubaydah.
He states that Abu 'Ubaydah sent thirty-five thousand warriors to
Bayt al-Maqdis under the leadership of seven commanders, each
commander leading five thousand men. They were: Kh%d ibn alWaleed, Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyin, S h d b e e l ibn Hasanah, al-Mirqil
ibn Hishim ibn Abi Waqq6, al-Musayyib ibn Najiyah al-Faziri,
Qays ibn Hubayrah al-Muridi and 'Urwah ibn al-Muhallal ibn
Yazeed. He sent them on seven consecutive days, one commander

per day, then he joined them a few days after fighting broke out
Al-Wiqidi went further
between them and the ganison of the
than that and said that the people of Aeelia' came to Abn 'Ubaydah
offering to let him enter the city peackfully, on condition that the
treaty be done by the caliph of the Muslims, 'Umar, then he
mentioned a report that is similar to the report narrated by at-Tabari
and Ibn al-Atheer, adding that Abu 'Ubaydah wrote to the caliph
telling him what had happened. The caliph came to Bayt al-Maqdis
and camped by the city walls, and the Patriarch came out to meet him,
and said: "By Allah, this is the one whose description we find in our
books, the one at whose hands our land will be conquered."58Then
he went back to his people and told them, and they came rushing out,
having suffered greatly during the siege, and opened the gate. They
came out to 'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib and asked him for a peace treaty
and protection, and agreeing to pay the jizyah to him.59We regard
this report of al-Wiqidi's as unlikely to be true, because we believe
that whilst 'Amr ibn al-'AS was besieging Jerusalem, his fellow
Muslim commanders, after al-Yarmook, Damascus and F w , were
travelling all over Syria, achieving victories. Abu 'Ubaydah,
accompanied by Khilid ibn al-Waleed, conquered Homs, Hama,
Qinnasreen and Aleppo, then he followed the coastal route south and
took control of Antioch, Latakia and 'Arqah. Yazeed ihn Abi Snfiygn
seized control of the coastal route from Beirnt to Sidon, and north
from 'Asqallin to ~ ~ e .But
6 'al-Balidhnri notes in a report that 'Amr
ibn al-'A~is the one who besieged Jernsalem after the conquest of
Rafa, and that Abn 'Ubaydah came and joined him after conquering
Qinnasreen and its environs, in 16 A.H. He was the one who besieged

Z4e Conquest8 of Syria, Egypt and Libya

Aeelia', and Aeelia' is the city of Bayt al-Maqdis (i.e., ~erusalem)!'
The people of Aeelia' asked Abu 'Ubaydah for safety and a peace
deal along the same lines as the peace deals with other cities of Syria,
on condition that the peace deal with made with 'Umar ibn alKhaMb himself. Abu 'Ubaydah wrote to the caliph telling him of
that, and 'Umar came and camped in al-Jibiyah, near Damascus, then
travelled to Aeelia', where he entered into a peace deal with its
people. The conquest of Aeelia' took place in 17 A.H. Al-Balidhuri
then adds that there was another report concerning the conquest of
~eelia'~',but we believe the first report which was narrated by atTabari to be more likely. This report says that the siege of Jerusalem
was carried out by 'Amr ibn al-'As, and not by Abu 'Ubaydah. We
think that it is not unlikely that Abu 'Ubaydah joined the caliph
'Umar in al-Jibiyah for consultations concerning the conquest,
seeing that he was the commander in chief of the Muslim armies in
Syria, especially since we know that Abu 'Ubaydah was the second
one, after Yazeed, to meet the caliph when he arrived in al-Jiibiyah
and summoned all the commanders of the troops in ~ y r i afor~ a~
consultation. Abu 'Ubaydah was present, along with Yazeed,

K h a d ibn al-Waleed did, as is indicated by the text of the document

1.7.4. The text of the document
There follows the text of the treaty as it was narrated by atTabark

"In the name of AUah the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, This is
what the servant of Allah, 'Umar, the Ameer al-Mu'mineen, has
granted to the people of Aeelia' of security: He has granted them
security for themselves, their possessions, their churches and crosses,
their sick and healthy and all their co-religionists. Their churches
shall not be taken for residence and shall not be demolished, nothing
shall be damaged from them or from their surroundings, nor shall
their crosses be removed or anything taken from their property. They
shall not be harassed because of their religion, and none of them shall
be harmed. No Jew will be allowed to live with them in Aeelia'.
The people of Aeelia' will have to pay Jizyah as the inhabitants of
other cities pay. They have to expel kom Aeelia' the Byzantines and
thieves. Those of them who leave shall have security for themselves
and their belongings until they reach a place of safety, but anyone
from among them who wants to stay in Aeelia' shall be safe provided
they pay the Jiwah like the people of Aeelia'.
If any of the people of Aeelia' want to leave with the Byzantines and
take their belongings with them, they and their churches and crosses
shall be safe until they reach a place of safety. Any of the people of
the land who were in Aeelia' before the slaying of its last leader shall
have the option of either staying, provided they pay thejizyah like the
people of Aeelia' or if they so wish, they will be allowed to leave
with the Byzantines or go back to their original homes. Nojizyah will
be collected fiom them until they are able to pay it.
The promise of Allah, may He be exalted, His Messenger @), the
Khaleefah, and the believers is therefore given to abide by the terms
of this treaty as long as the people pay the jizyah.

Important lessons
The sacrificial attitude of Wzthilah ibn al-Asqa' (&)
Withilah said: "... I heard the squeaking of the gate of alJibiyah, which was one of the gates of Damascns, so I waited, then I
saw a huge cavalry. I waited for awhile, then I rushed at them, saying
takbeer, and they thought that they were surrounded, so they fled
back to the city, abandoning their leader. I ran him through and threw
him £tom his nag, then I grabbed the reins of the nag and ran. They
turned around and when they saw that I was alone, they followed me.
I ran a horseman through with my spear and killed him, then another
came close and I killed him too. Then I came to Khilid ibn al-Waleed
and told him, and there was a leader of the Byzantines with him,
seeking safety for the people of ~amascns.~'

The mission of Mu'lidh ibn Jabal to the
Byzantines just before the battle of Fihl
After skirmishes between the Muslims and the Byzantines,
just before the battle of Fihl, the Byzantines sent word to the Muslims
asking them to send a man to them, "So that we may ask hun what
yon want and are asking for and calling to, and we may tell him what
we want." So Abu 'Ubaydah sent M u ' m ibn Jabal a l - to ~
them as an envoy, to negotiate on behalf of the Muslims. The
Byzantines prepared to welcome him, bringing out theu most
beautihl adornments and most lethal weapons. They spread the most

~

'Umar ibn al-KhaGb

costly and dazzling carpets and cushions on the ground, to distract
Mn'idh from what he had come for, or to terrify and discourage him.
But he surprised them with his disdain for their adornments and his
refusal of all kinds of temptation, and with his humility and
asceticism. Indeed, he took advantage of the situation and used it as a
weapon against the Byzantines. He held on to the reins of his horse
and refused to hand them to the Byzantine slave. He also refused to
sit in the place that the Byzantines had prepared for him, saying, "I
will not sit on these cushions that you enjoy at the expense of your
weak ones." He sat on the ground and said, "I am one of the slaves of
Allah and I sit on the ground of AUah. I will not enjoy anything of the
wealth of Allah to the exclusion of my brothers."68
A discussion took place between them, in which they asked
him about Islam and he answered them. They asked him about the
Prophet of Allah 'Eesa
and he recited to them the verse in which
Allah
says:

(a)

(m)

BVerily, the likeness of 'Eesa [Jesus] before Allah is the likeness of
Adam. He created him &om dust, then [He] said to him, 'Be!' -and
he was.#
(Qur'an 3: 59)
He explained to them what the Muslims wanted &om them, and he
recited to them the verse:

40' you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to
you, and let them find harshness in

(Qur 'an 9: 123)

They told h i that the reason why the Muslims had been
victorious over the Persians was the death of their king, (and said):
"The king of the Byzantines is alive and his troops are innumerable."
He said to them, "Your king is Heraclius but our King is Allah, and
our commander is a man from among us. If he treats us in accordance

298

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt andLibya

with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Prophet, we will
approve of him, but if he does otherwise, we will dismiss him. He
does not isolate himself from us and he is not arrogant and does not
AS for their large numbers, he responded by
act superior to
reciting to them the verse:

B... How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's
Leave? And Allah is with a?-Sdbiroon [the patient].# (Qur 'an 2: 249)
When the Byzantines failed to influence Mu'idh or undermine
his confidence with the adornments and show that they had prepared,
they came back to reality and offered him a peace deal, whereby they
would give al-Balq2 and its environs to the Muslims. Mu'&
informed them that he was not the Muslim leader, and that their
options were either to become Muslim or to pay thejizyah or to fight.
They got angry and said, "Go back to your companions, and we hope
that soon we will capture you and put you in chains." Mu'kib said,
"No way. By Allah you will have to kill us all, or we shall chase you
out, humiliated." Then he went away?' During this mission, Mu'idh
exhibited a military and political character, calling the people to
Islam and refuting the arguments of his opponents, exposing their
faults and their arrogant treatment of their own people, reminding
them of the teachings of their own religion and calling them to Islam.
As for their exaggerations and attempts at psychological warfare, he
repelled them by referring to reality, with no exaggeration or scaremongering. Then he went back to his leaders, who approved of
7~
everything that he bad done and said to the ~ ~ z a n t i n e s .The
Muslims always called their opponents to Islam before the fighting
began.

The attitude of 'Ubidah ibn as-Sirnit
during the conquest of Caesarea
'Ubidah ibn w - S h i t was on the right flank of the Muslim
m y during the siege of Caesarea. He exhorted his troops and called
on them to check on themselves and beware of sin. Then he led an
attack in which many of the Byzantines were killed, but he did not
manage to achieve his goal. He went back to the place from which he
had set out and urged his companions to fight, expressing his
astonishment that he had not managed to achieve the aims of this
attack. He said: "0' people of Islam, I was one of the youngest of
those who came to give the oath of allegiance, and I have been one of
the longest-lived. Allah has decreed that I should remain alive until I
fight this enemy with you ... By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I
have never launched an attack with a group of believers against a
group of rnushn'ken but they fled from us and Allah caused us to
prevail. What is wrong with you that you attacked these people but
did not cause them to flee?"" Then he explained to them what he
feared for them and said, "By Allah, I fear two things for you: that
you may have stolen from the war booty, and that you may not have
been sincere towards Allah when you attacked them."73 He urged his
companions to seek martyrdom sincerely, and told them that he
would be in the forefront and would never return to his place, until
Allah granted h i victory or blessed him with martyrdom.74When
the Muslims and Byzantines met, 'Ubklah dismounted and started
marching towards the enemy. When 'Umayr ibn Sa'd al-Aus2ri saw
him, he called the Muslims and told them what their leader had done,
and urged them to follow his example. Then they fought the

She said, "Why don't you delay it until this battle is over?" but
Khilid said: "I have a feeling that I will be killed." She said, "It is up
to you." So he spent the wedding night with her at the bridge m qSak, hence the bridge became known as the Bridge of Umm
Hakeem. And he gave a wedding feast for her and invited his
companions to come and eat. When they had finished eating, the
Byzantines drew up ranks and K h a d ibn Sa'eed went out for single
combat and was killed. Umm Hakeem tied up her garments and went
out, ready to fight, still with traces of perfnme on her. They fought a
fierce battle at the river, and both sides endured with patience,
exchanging blows with their swords. On that day, Umm Hakeem

He asked one of his followers, who had been held captive by the
Muslims, "Tell me about these people." He said, "I shall tell you so
that it is as if you can see them. They are knights by day and monks
by night. They do not take anything unlawfully, they do not enter a

According to a report narrated from Hishim ibn 'Urwah, his

of the troops and the leaders of the local people. 'Umar asked,
"Where is my brother?" They said, "Who?" He said, "Abu

Comments on the treaty with t k people of Jerusalem
The treaty docnment which was drawn up by 'Umar (&)
bears trne testimony to the fact that Islam is a religion of tolerance
and not a religion of compulsion. It bears testimony that t h e ~ u s l i m s
treated the Christians in Jerusalem in a manner that had not even
crossed their minds. 'Umar -who was the conqueror could have
imposed on them whatever he wanted and forced them to do
whatever he wanted, but he did not do that, because he was
representing Islam, and Islam does not force anyone to enter it, and it
does not accept faith from anyone unless they believe voluntarily and
in submission to Allah, for faith is not something that can be forced
on people, because it is an action of the heart, and no one knows the
innennost secrets of the heart except Allah, may He be glorified. A
person may appear to you outwardly to be a believer when that is not
the case, and such a person may cause more harm to the believers
than those who outwardly show their disbelief and atheism. Hence
the Muslims prefer to give people fi-eedom ofworship, and guarantee

the safety of everything that is dear to them, so that they may live
under the protection of the Muslims, paying thejizyah in return for
that protection. In the shade of this peaceful and quiet life, living
together under the protection and justice of the Muslims, the nonMuslims will see at close hand the beauty, tolerance, fairness and
justice of Islam, and will see the truths that had been hidden from
them because they were far away from it. At that point they will enter
the religion of Allah in crowds, as happened in every land which was
conquered by the Muslims, where they granted safety to the people.89
'Urnar prays in al-Masjid al-Aqsa
Abu Salamah said: Abu Sinin told me that 'Ubayd ihn Adam
said: "I heard 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib say to Ka'b, 'Where do you think
I should pray?' He said, 'If I were you, I would pray behind the Rock,
then all of Jerusalem will be before you.' 'Umar said, 'This is like the
Jewish way. No, I will pray where the Messenger of Allah (g)
prayed.' So he went forward towards the qiblah and prayed. Then he
came and spread his cloak and cleared away the garbage with his
cloak, and the people did likewise?'
Ibn Taymiyah said: "Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name of the
entire mosque. Some people have started to use the name al-Aqsa for
the prayer-place which was built by 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib at the
front. Praying in this place that 'Umar built is better than praying
anywhere else in the rest of the mosque. When 'Umar ibn al-Khasb
conquered Jerusalem, there was a huge garbage dump on the rock,
because the Christians used to deliberately treat it in a disrespectful
manner, to annoy the Jews who used to pray in that direction. 'Umar
issued orders that the filth be removed, and said to Ka'b, "Where do

you think we should build the prayer-place of the Muslims?" He
said, "Behind the Rock." 'Umar said, "0' son of a Jewish woman,
you are influenced by the Jews! Rather I shall build it at the front, for
the front part of the mosque is ours."91
This is another example of the brilliant attitude of 'Umar,
which proves in a practical way that Islam respects all the divinelyrevealed religions and respects all the holy places, without exception.
This Rock, from which 'Umar removed the dirt and filth with his own
hands and carried it away in his cloak to cleanse it, was the qiblah
(direction of prayer) of the Jews, and the Rock which was venerated
by them because it was where God had spoken to Jacob according
to their beliefs. Similarly 'Umar adopted a brilliant attitude towards
the Christians when he allowed them freedom of belief and
guaranteed safety for their crosses and churches. He did not withhold
this attitude from the Jews either, despite the crimes that they had
committed a g m t the Muslims, as he removed the dirt from the Rock
and took care to show his respect towards it.92

A Byzantine attempt to re-occupy Horns
The spies of Abu 'Ubaydah came to him and told him that the

them in his direction. Abu 'Ubaydah decided to tell this news from
his troops, and he called the leaders of the Muslims, and the
prominent and righteous among them, together to consult them and
hear their opinions.93Mu'idh ibn Jabal al-Ansin thought that they
should not withdraw, and he said, "Are the Byzantines seeking to do
to their enemy something more harmful than what you want to do to
yourselves? Will you give to them a land that Allah enabled you to

conquer where their heroes were killed and their troops defeated? By
Allah, if you want to go back after having left it, you will find it very
difficult." Abu 'Ubaydah said, "He has spoken sincerely and has
spoken the truth, by ~ l l a h . "But
~ ~events took a different turn, and
the Muslims gave back to the people of Horns what they had
collected from them. Abu 'Ubaydah ordered Habeeb ibn Maslamah,
"Give back to the local people with whom we made a treaty what we
took from them, for we should not take anything from them if we do
not protect them." And he said to them, "We are bound by the same
terms between us and you, and we will not retract anything so long as
you do not do so. The only reason why we are returning your wealth
to you is that we do not want to take your wealth when we cannot
protect your land. We are simply moving to some other land and
sending for our brothers to come to us, then we will face our enemy
and fight. If Allah causes us to prevail, then we will fulfil our
covenant with you, unless you change your minds." The next day,
Abu 'Ubaydah ordered the Muslim army to march to Damascus, and
Habeeb ibn Maslamah called the people from whom he had taken the
jizyah and returned their wealth to them. He told them what Abu
'Ubaydah had said, and the people of Homs started saying, "May
Allah bring you back to us, and may Allah curse the Byzantines who
used to rule over us. By Allah, they would not have returned anything
to us, rather they would have confiscated it and taken whatever they
could of our wealth. Your rule and justice are dearer to us than the
oppression that we used to
Abu 'Ubaydah sent Sufiyk ibn 'Awfto 'Umar on the night of
the withdrawal from Homs to Damascus, saying, "Go to the caliph
and give him my salim, and tell him what you have seen and what
the spies have told us, and what you know of the k g e numbers of the

enemy, and what the Muslims have decided to do, namely
withdraw." And he wrote a letter to send with him, in which he said:
"My spies have come to me from the land of my enemy, from the
town in which the king of the Byzantines was, and they told me that
the Byzantines are heading towards us and have gathered against us
in huge numbers that they never gathered against any army before us.
I summoned the Muslims and told them the news, and I consulted
with them. They agreed to withdraw fiom them until we heard your
opinion. I am sending to you a man who has knowledge of what is
happening here, so ask him whatever you want, for he is
knowledgeable about that and he is trusted by us. We seek the help of
Allah the Almighty and All-Knowing, He is sufficient for us and is
the best disposer of affairs."96

The brilliant war plan drawn up by 'Umar (&)

to save Abu 'Ubaydah (&)
When the news reached 'Umar, he wrote to Sa'd ihn Abi
Waqq& (&) saying: "Send some troops with al-Qa'qi' ibn 'Am,
and send them straightaway, on the day when this letter reaches you,
to Homs, for Abu 'Ubaydah is in danger." 'Umar had prepared a
reserve cavalry in every region in the event of a sudden outbreak of
war. In Koofah there were four thousand horses, with which Sa'd
equipped the army that he sent to Syria. 'Umar also wrote to Sa'd,
"Send Suhayl ibn 'Adiyy to al-Jazeerab with the troops, and let him
go to ar-Raqqah, for the people of al-Jazeerah are the ones who
incited the Byzantines against the people of Homs. And send
'Abdull* ibn 'Abdullih ibn 'Utbk to Nqeebeen, and let them clear
Hamk and ar-Raha of the presence of any enemies. And send alWaleed ibn 'Uqbah with the Arabs of al-Jazeerah from (the tribes of)
Rabee'ah and Tunookh. And send 'Iyu, and when fighting breaks

out, let them all come under the command of ' I y 3 ibn Ghanam."
Al-Qa'q2 set out with four thousand men on the day the letter
arrived, and headed towards Homs. 'Iyid ibn Ghanam and the
leaders of al-Jazeerah set out and headed towards the goals they were
seeking. 'Umar set out from Madeenah to help Abu 'Ubaydah,
heading towards Homs until he stopped in al-Jibiyah. The people of
al-Jazeerah who were participating in the siege of Homs with the
Byzantines found out that the army had set out from Iraq, and they
did not know whether they were heading for Homs or their own lands
in al-Jazeerah, so they scattered, going back to their lands and their
brethren, and they left the Byzantines facing the battle on their own.
When Abu 'Ubaydah saw that the Byzantines' supporters from alJazeerah had let them down, he consulted Khilid with a view to
going out and fighting them, and Khilid advised him to do that. So
they went out and fought them, and Allah granted them victory. AlQa'qi' ibn 'Amr came with the people of Koofah three days after the
battle, and 'Umar came to al-Jibiyah, and they wrote to him, telling
him of the victory and the arrival of reinforcements three days after
the victory, and asking h i about the ruling on dividing the booty. He
wrote to them telling them: "Give them (the reinforcements) a share,
for they were coming to help you, and your enemy scattered because
of them."97 And he said, "May Allah reward the people of Koofah
with good, for they take care of their own land and they send
reinforcements to other regions too."98
If we study this brilliant war plan which was drawn up by
'Umar to confuse the enemy and scatter them, we will see the militruy
genius of 'Umar. He ordered that a swift m y be sent from Koofah to
Horn to undertake the rescue mission, and he himself set out with an

'Umar ibn al-Khanib

309

army from Madeenah. All of tbis appears to be something normal,
but the amazing aspect is the fact that he ordered an army to be sent to
the land of the enemy fighters, to force them to leave the battlefield
and return to their land in order to defend it. This plan succeeded and
they scattered and it then became easy for the Muslims to finish off
the ~ ~ z a n t i n e s . ~ ~

The conquest of al-Jazeerah (Mesopotamia), 17 A.H.
We have stated above that the Byzantines and the people of alJazeerah attacked Homs and besieged Abu 'Ubaydah and the
Muslims who were in the city. 'Umar sent word to Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqqi?, ordermg him to send an army from Koofah as
reinforcements to the people of Homs, and to send an army to alJazeerah. Sa'd sent an army from Koofah under the leadership of alQa'q2' ibn 'Amr at-Tameemi, and he sent armies to al-Jazeerah, all of
them under the leadership of 'Iyid ibn Ghanam (4).
These armies
set out for al-Jazeerah. Subayl ibn 'Adiyy followed the Euphrates
route until he reached ar-Raqqah, where he lay siege to them, and
they found themselves caught between two Muslim forces, in Iraq
and Syria, so they made a peace deal with them. 'Abdullib ibn
'Abdulliib ibn 'Utbiin followed the Tigris route until he reached
Nqeebeen, where the people made a peace deal as the people of arRaqqah had done. When the people of ar-Raqqah and Nqeebeen
submitted, 'Iyid got Suhayl and 'Abdullib to join him, and took
them all to H h , conquering all the cities on the way. When they
reached H h , the people hastened to submit and agreed to pay the
jizyah. Then he sent 'Abdullib and Suhayl to ar-Ruha and make them
agree to pay the jizyah. Thus all of al-Jazeerah was conquered by
peaceful means, and it was the easiest of lands to conquer.'OO

The Conquests of Syria, E ~ g and
y Libya

2. The Conquests of Egypt and Libya
The Muslims had strong motives for conquering Egypt. There
was the faith which they wanted to spread everywhere, and Egypt
was also connected to Palestine, so it was natural that after
conquering Palestine, the Muslims would turn their attention to
Egypt. The Muslims had split the Byzantine Empire into two parts
which were connected only by sea, when they overtook Syria. In
Egypt and Nortb Afiica there were Byzantine troops and outposts,
and Byzantium had a powerful navy at sea, but the Muslims would
not be able to feel secure in Syria whilst Egypt remained under
Byzantine control. Egypt was rich land, the source of
Constantinople's food supply. If the Muslims conquered it, that
would greatly weaken the influence of Byzantium and the Muslim
in Syria and the Hijk would feel secure because otherwise it was too
easy for the Byzantines to reach the Hijk by way of ~gypt."'
Another factor was that the Coptic Egyptians themselves were
suffering kom persecution at the hands of the Byzantines, who lived
in Egypt only in fortified military outposts. Why not make the most
of this opportuuity, especially since news of the Muslims' justice had
~ for the Byzantine troops themselves,
already reached ~ g y p t ? "AS
fear must have seized themlo3when they saw their king leaving Syria
to become part of the Muslim state.
'Amr ibn al-'AS understood all this, and reached the
conclusion that the Byzantines in Egypt would be unable to
withstand the Muslims, but if Egypt was left without being
conquered, it would remain a potential threat to them. This is what

'Umar ibn al-Khaffib

31 1

'Amr ibn al-As himself statedIo4,despite the numerous reports which
suggest that the first one to think of conquering Egypt was 'Amr ibn
al-'AS, or the caliph himself, with no input on the part of 'Amr,or that
Despite these
the caliph agreed under pressure from
ditferences, all the factors mentioned above prove that the plan to
conquer Egypt was not merely a thought that crossed 'Amr's mind, of
which the caliph did not approve, or that they did not have a complete
picture of Egypt, the land and the size of the enemy forces there.
Historical reports support what I have said. Ihn 'Abdul-Hakam stated
that 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb wrote to 'Amr ihn al-'AS after the conquest
of Syria, telling him: "Urge the people to march with you to Egypt,
and whoever wants to go with you, take him along."Io6 It says in atTabark " 'Umar stayed in Aeelia' for a few days afier he had made a
peace treaty with its people and entered the city, then he sent 'Amr
ihn al-'AS to Egypt and appointed him as its governor, if Allah
enabled him to conquer it. He sent az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwkn aRer
him with reinforcements. That is confirmed by the fact that the
number of these reinforcements whom 'Umar sent to Egypt reached
twelve thousand. He also ordered him to conquer Alexandria, and
there is no dispute on this matter.."Io7

Would it have been possible for 'Amr to penetrate deeply into
Egypt without the consent of the caliph? We know that the Muslims,
whether commanders or soldiers, were extremely obedient and
disciplined, hence we repeat that the conquest of Egypt could only
have been part of a plan that had already been drawn up by the caliph
and his commanders; it was not something that was done on the spur
of the moment.'08

The Conquests of Syria,Egypt and Libya

2.1. The Islamic Conquest of Egypt
The conquest of Egypt is regarded as the third stage in the
conquests of the major regions of the Byzantine state. 'Amr's march
fiom Palestine to Egypt ran parallel to the sea. He moved from Raf*
to al-'Areesh to a l - F m a (Pelusium), and his progress continued
onward to Cairo and then Alexandria. This shows us the military
talent of 'Amr, since he chose this route, perhaps because the
Byzantines did not have a heavy military presence along this route as
they did in Syria, or perhaps because this route was known to 'Amr
ibn al-'AS. The sequence of conquests was in the order listed
below. log

2.1.1. The conquest of al-Farma (l'elusium)
'Amr headed west, and he did not encounter any Byzantine
troops except in al-Farma. But before that the Egyptians had met him
and welcomed him. The first place where fighting took place was in
al-Famna where the Byzantines barricaded themselves in the city to
face the Muslims, confident of their ability to defend the city and
repel the Muslims. After they realized that the Muslims who had
come with 'Amr were few in number and were less well equipped
and were lacking in siege machines, 'Amr found out the number of
Byzantine troops, their level of preparedness and that they were
many times greater in numbers than his troops. He had two options
for the conquest of al-Farma: either to attack and open the gates, or
else be patient and wait until hunger forced the people to come out.
The Muslims siege of the city intensified, and the stubbornness of the
Byzantines increased. The siege lasted for several months, during
lo9 Xmr ibn ol- gr al-Qd'id wa as-Siydsi, by Dr. 'Abdur-R&eem M u h d ,
p. 79.

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

313

which some of the Byzantine forces would come out to fight the
Muslims f?om time to time, but the Muslims killed them all. 'Amr
would encourage and exhort the Muslims with powerful words, such
as when he said: "0' people of Islam and faith, 0' bearers of the
Qur'an, 0' Companions of Muhammad
Be patient like men and
be steadfast; do not retreat. Sharpen your spears and protect
yourselves with your shields, and remain quiet except for the
remembrance of Allah. Do not do anything unless I tell you to.""'

a)!

One day a group of Byzantines came out to fight a group of
Muslims, and the Muslims defeated them. The Byzantines fled
towards the city, followed by the Muslims, but the Muslims were
faster than them, and they gained control of the gate before the
Byzantines reached it. The first of the Muslims to enter the city was
Asmeeqa', and it was an evident victory. It is worth mentioning that
the Egyptian Copts who were in the city helped the Muslims and
showed them the weak points. They welcomed the Muslims in
Atmeedah. Afier al-Farma had been occupied, the Muslims
destroyed its walls and fortifications so that it would not be of any use
to the Byzantines if -Allah forbid -they returned to the city. Then
'Amr addressed his troops, saying: "0' people, praise be to Allah
Who has granted victory to the Muslim army. Allah is Great, Who
has honoured us by Islam. But beware of thinking that we have
achieved everything we wanted, and do not let this victory make you
complacent. There is still a difficult road ahead of us, and the mission
with which the caliph has entrusted us is far kom having been
accomplished. You have to be patient and obey your leaders. The
people here will know that we are the troops of peace, so we should
not cause any mischief in the land, rather we should restore it and set
a good example of the teachings of the Messenger @)."l'

'Amr was confident that the city was no longer good to protect
any army that might seek shelter therein. He checked on his army to
see what he had lost during the battle, and he was saddened to learn
that he had lost some men who had been eager to conquer Egypt, but
they had died before achieving that. He feared that if the battles
continued in this fashion, he would not be able to reach his goal. But
Allah compensated him for those whom he had lost, and his army
was joined by many men from the Arab tribes of Rkhidah and
Lakhm who lived in Jabal a l - ~ a l i l . "'Amr

and his army continued
westwards, not encountering any resistance, until they arrived in alQawiqir (al-Qas@een), from which he headed south until he reached
Widi at-Tambalb, which is near at-Tell al-Kabeer. Then he
continued southwards until he reached Balbees. The author of anNujoom az-Zrihirah said: "Then 'Amr advanced, meeting with only a
little resistance, until he came to ~albees.""~

2.1.2. The conquest of Balbees
At Balbees the Byzantines appeared with a large force, aiming
to stop 'Amr &om heading towards the fortress of Babaliyon and
seeking to engage the Muslims in fighting. 'Amr (&) said to them:
"Do not hasten to fight until we have discussed the matter. Let Abu
Maryam and Abu M a r y h come to me." At that point they rehined
h m fighting and the two men went out to meet hi.He called them
to become Muslim or pay the jizyah, and told them of the Prophet's
recommendation to treat the people of Egypt with kindness because
of Hijar, the mother of Ismi'eel. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that
the Messenger of Allah @) said: cc'You are going to conquer Egypt,
which is a land where the qircit 'I4 is used. When you conquer it, treat

no one would pay attention to it hut the Prophets. Give us security
until we come back." 'Amr said, "One like me cannot be deceived,
but I will give you respite for three days." They said, "Give us
more," so he gave them one extra day. They went back to alMuqawqis, the ruler of ~ ~ ~ and~ Amboon,

is indicative of the Muslims' noble attitude and chivalry. When Allah
enabled the Muslims to conquer Balbees, they found therein the
daughter of al-Muqawqis whose name was Armanoosah. She was
close to her father, but she was visiting the city of Balbees with her
servant Barbara in an attempt to escape marriage to Constantine the
son of Heraclius, whom she did not want to many.When some of the
Muslim army managed to capture Armanoosah, 'Amr ibn al-'AS
gathered the S a h i b a h together and reminded them of the words of
Allah (%):
41s there any reward for good other than good?) (Qur'an 55: 60)
Then he said: "Al-Muqawqis sent a gift to our Prophet; I think we
should return his daughter to him, and a l l of her servants and
entourage whom we have captured, and their wealth that we seized."
They agreed to that."' So 'Amr sent her back to her father with
honour, along with all her jewels and male and female slaves. Her
servant Barbara said to her during the journey: "0' my mistress, the
=era to another.

Arabs are surrounding us on all sides." Armanoosah said, "I feel that
my life and my honour are safe among the tents ofthe Arabs, but I do
not feel safe in the palace of my father."'I9 When she reached her
father, he was very pleased with her and the way that the Muslims
had treated her.''

2.1.3. The battle of Umm Daneen
Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam reported that 'Amr went with his m y and
conquered Balbees after fighting that lasted for nearly one montb.
Then he went to Umm Daneen, which is also known as al-Muqassas;
it is located on the Nile. The Muslims fought an intense battle around
it, and 'Amr sent word to the caliph asking for reinforcements. The
caliph sent him four thousandmen; in charge of every thousand was a
man who was as effective as one thousand men. They were: azZubayr ibn al-'Awwh, al-Miqdid ibn al-Aswad, 'Ubidah ibn asS h i t and Maslamah ibn Mukhallad; or it was said that the fourth one
was Khirijah ibn Hudhifah. 'Umar said in his letter to him:
"Remember that you have with you twelve thousand men, and twelve
thousand will never be defeated for lack of number^."'^' The
Byzantines came out with the Egyptians to conkont the Muslims, and
a fierce battle broke out in which 'Amr ibn al-'AS used his military
genius as Khiilid ibn al-Waleed had done in the battles of Iraq. He
divided his army into three groups, one of which was to lie in wait for
the enemy in al-Jabal al-Ahmar, another was to lie in wait by the Nile,
near Umm Daneen, and the rest of the m y was to face the enemy.
When fighting between the two sides broke out, the troops who were
lying in wait in al-Jabal a l - m a r emerged and attacked the

Byzantines, who broke ranks and fled towards Umm Daneen, where
they were met by the group that was lying in wait near the city. Thus
they found themselves caught between the three divisions of the
Muslim army; they were defeated and their army destroyed, and
" ~ the Muslims

won this battle and Allah protected them fiom the evil of their
enemies by His grace. That was due to the brilliance of their leader
who drew up this brilliant plan which scattered the enemy forces.Iz3

2.1.4. The battle of the fortress of Babaliyon
'Amr and his army advanced towards the fortress of Babaliyon
and besieged it. The siege lasted for seven months, during which time
al-Muqawqis sent his envoys to 'Amr ibn d-'AS to negotiate with
him. 'Amr responded by stipulating that he either become Muslim,
pay the jizyah or fight. Al-Muqawqis chose to pay the jizyah, and
wrote to Heraclius asking his permission to do so. But Heraclius did
not accept that; he got angry, rebuked him severely and summoned
him to Constantinople, then he banished him. When the conquest of
the fortress of Babaliyon took too long, az-Zubayr ibn d-'Awwh
said: "I am going to sacrifice myself for Allah, and I hope that Allah
will grant victory to the Muslims thereby."lZ4 'Amr ibn al-'& was
besieging the fortress of Babaliyon, then they climbed up the walls of
the fortress at night and fought violently with the soldiers. The first
one to climb the fortress was az-Znbayr ibn alL'Awwh. He placed a
ladder near the bird market (souq al-ham6m) then climbed up. He
told the Muslims to attack the fortress when they heard his takbeer.
Soon az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh reached the top, and said takbeer,

wielding his sword. He said takbeer and the Muslims outside the
fortress responded. The people inside the fortress did not doubt that
the Muslims had conquered their fortress, so they fled. Az-Zubayr led
his companions to the gate of Babaliyon and opened it, and the
Muslims rushed in and seized the fortress by force. But 'Amr ibn al'As made a treaty stipulatingthat the Byzantine troops bring out with
them only the supplies that they needed for a few days; the fortress of
Babaliyon and its stores and weapons would remain as booty for the
Muslims. Then Abu 'Abdullih destroyed the towers and walls of the
fortress.lZ5

2.2. The conquest of Alexandria
'Amr ibn al-'As and his troops stayed in the fortress of
Babaliyon for several months, so that the troops could rest whilst
awaiting permission from the caliph 'Umar to proceed with the
conquest of Alexandria. When permission came, 'Amr left a strong
Muslim force in the fortress, and set out with his troops from
Babaliyon in May 641 C.E. (Jumcida al-Akhirah 21 A.H.). He was
accompanied by a number of Egyptian leaders who realized that their
interests lay in supporting the victorious Muslim forces. They
repaired the roads for them, and set up bridges and marketplaces. The
Egyptians became their helpers in their aim to fight the

to travel along the left hand side of the
Nile, where the province of B*ayrah is now, because the desert gave
him plenty of room for his horses and troops, and enabled him to
avoid the many streams that would have impeded his progress if he
had travelled through the Nile delta. 'Amr did not encounter any
fighting except a little at Marfoot or at-Tarinah, as the Arab

historians call it.lZ7Then he crossed the river to the eastem side at the
fortified city of Nuqyoos, because it contained a strong fortress and
'Amr was afraid to leave it behind and move on. But instead of
banicading themselves against the Muslims in their fortresses, the
Byzantines used ships to fight the Muslims and prevent them fiom
approaching their cities; they fired arrows at the Muslims to prevent
them getting near the river, then they fled in their ships towards
Alexandria. But those who stayed in the fortresses quickly
surrenderedto the Muslims and the Muslims entered them victorious.
They spent a number of days in "mop up" operations against the
enemylZ8,and 'Amr sent his commander Shareek ibn Sumayy to
pursue the fleeing Byzantines. When he met them he had only a few
soldiers with him, so the Byzantines' hopes were raised and they
snrrounded him. He sought protection from them in a hill that later
became known as the hill of Shareek. He sent word to 'Amr asking
for reinforcements and as soon as the Byzantines realized that the
reinforcements were on their way to the Muslims they fled.lz9
At SulBys, six miles to the south of Damanhoor, the second
encounter between 'Amr and the Byzantines took place. There was a
fierce battle in which they were defeated and fled.130 It is most
unfortunate that these battles, in which the Muslims fought with
limited numbers against forces that were vastly superior to them in
terms of both numbers and equipment, and which lasted for a number
of days, get no more than a few lmes or a few words from the Muslim
historians, whereas they devoted dozens of pages to the battles of alQ2disiyah, Y m o o k and ~ a h a w a n d . 'One

our Arab sources did not cover properly was the battle of Kiryoon,
which was the last of this chain of fortresses that stretched from
Babaliyon to Alexandria. The Byzantine commander Theodore had
barricaded himself there, and a fierce battle that lasted for more than
ten days took place. In spite of that, Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam does not say
more than these few words about it: "Then they met in Kiryoon, and
fought there for more than ten days. 'Abdulliih ibn 'Amr was in the
forefkont and the flag-bearer that day was Wardin, the freed slave of
'Amr. 'Amr offered the fear prayer that day, then Allah granted
victory to the Muslims. The Muslims killed a huge number of them,
and chased them as far as Alexandria. There are reports of the heroic
deeds of 'Abdulliih ibn 'Amr and Wardin, the fkeed slave of his
father, during that battle."13'
At the time of the Muslim conquest, Alexandria was the
capital of Egypt and the second city of the Byzantine Empire after
Constantinople; it was also the foremost trading city in the world.
The Byzantines understood the seriousness of a Muslim takeover of
the city and were very concerned about that. Heraclius said: "If the
Arabs seize Alexandria, that will signal the end of Byzantine
IUle,,~133

The historical narrators claim that Heraclius prepared himself
to go out to Alexandria himself to lead the fight against the Muslims,
but when he had completed his preparations, Allah caused him to die,
thus Allah sufficed the Muslims against him.134
The Byzantine state
was thrown into turmoil after the death of Heraclius, when he was
succeeded by his two sons, Constantine and Heraclius 11
(Heraclianus). The empress Martina, the mother of Heraclianus, also

played a part in ruling. Constantine died a mere hundred days after
the death of his father, which caused fingers to be pointed at the
empress, who wanted her son to be the sole ruler. A revolution broke
out against her and the turmoil and civil war continued for several
months, until Constanus the son of Constantine took control as the
partner of his uncle ~erac1ianus.l~~

In addition to its huge, strong walls and ample defences,
Alexandria also enjoyed a unique defensive location. To the north it
was protected by the sea, where the Byzantines held complete sway
at that time. The lake of Maryoot protected it to the south, because
crossing it was very difficult, if not impossible. At that time one of
the branches of the Nile, which was h o w n as Naz'at ath-Tha'wbh,
encircled the city to the west. Thus there was only one route to the
city, fi-om the east, namely the road which connected it to K i r y ~ o n . ' ~ ~
The siege lasted for several months, which made 'Amr fear
that his troops may become tired or start to despair of ever defeating
their enemy. So he decided to send his troops through the Delta area
and the villages of Upper Egypt. The length of the Alexandria siege
also caused the caliph 'Umar to worry, and he started to entertain
doubts about the soldiers' readiness to sacrifice themselves and their
initiative. He thought that this might be because of some sins that
they had committed.137He explained that in a letter to 'Amr ibn al'& in which he said: "I am very surprised at how long it is taking to
conquer Egypt, as you have been fighting for the last two years,
unless it is because of some sins that you have committed, or you
have started to love this world as your enemy does. AUah,may He be
blessed and exalted, only grants victory to people who are sincere. I

am sending to you four individuals (meaning az-Zubayr and his
companions), and I have told you that each one of them is equivalent
to one thousand men as far as I know, unless somethg has changed
them. When you receive this letter of mine, address the people and
urge them to fight their enemy. Encourage them to be patient and to
have the right intention. Give these four men the position of
leadership. Tell the people that they should all attack as one under
their leadership, and let that be at noon on Friday, for that is a time
when divme mercy descends and it is a time when prayers are
answered. Let the people beseech AUah and ask Him for victory over
their enemies." When 'Anx received the letter, he gathered the
people together and read it to them, then he called those four men and
appointed them as leaders before the people. He ordered the people to
purify themselves and pray two rakhhs, then to turn to Allah and ask
Him for victory. They did that and Allah granted them ~ictory."~

It was narrated that 'Amr ibn al-'AS consulted Maslamah ibn
Mukhallad al-Ansiri and said: "Advise me about fighting these
people." Maslamah said: "I think that you should choose a man who
has knowledge and experience fkom among the Companions of the
Prophet @), and put him in charge of the people, then he should be
the one to initiate and take care of the fighting." 'Amr asked, "Who
should that be?" He said, " 'Uhkiah ibn w-Shit." 'Amr summoned
him, and when he came close he wanted to dismount ftom his horse,
but 'Amr said to him, "I urge you not to dismount. Give me your
spear." He handed it to him, and 'Amr took off his turban and tied it
to the spear, and he appointed him as leader of the fight against the
Byzantines. Allah granted him victory and Alexandria was
conquered at his hands that same day.13'

According to one report: "I thought about this matter and I
realized that no one could lead the Muslims to vlctory except those
who had led them to wctory during the early days," meaning the
A&r. So he summoned 'Ubiidah ibn as-Shit and appointed him as
leader, and Allah granted victory at his hands.l4'
Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam narrated that the siege of Alexandria lasted
for nine months, and that it was conquered at the beginning of
Muharram in 20 A.H.'~', which coincides wth 21 December 640
C.E., whereas Butler concludes in his study on the conquest of Egypt
that the siege started at the end of June 640 C.E. and the city
surrendered on 8 November 641 C.E.,which corresponds with 7 Dhu
a l - H i j ~ a h21 A.H. This new may be more correct, especially when
we refer to what is mentioned in the letter of 'Umar to 'Amr ibn al'As: "Yon have been fighting for the last two years." The hme
between 'Amr's arrival in al-'Areesh in December 639 C.E. and the
surrender of Alexandria in November 641 C.E. is equivalent to two
Hijn years.

' A m did not ham the people of Alexandria; he did not la11
them or take their women captive; rather he treated them as ahl adhdhimmah, like the people of Babaliyon. After things stabilized, he
left some of his troops as guards in Alexandria and the rest of his
troops fanned out to conquer the remaining Byzantine strongholds
and pockets in Egypt. Thus was achieved the conquest of the
Mediterranean coastline and its major cities such as Rasheed, Dimyii?
and others, and the Muslims seized full control of both the Delta
region and upper ~gypt.'"

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

2.3. The conquest of Barqah and Tripoli
After consolidating the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr set out to
continue his conquests westwards, as the Byzantines had troops in
Barqah and Tripoli and may thus have been tempted to attack the
Muslims in Egypt if the opportunity arose. So he set off towards
Barqah with his troops in 22 A.H. The road between Alexandria and
Barqah at that time was filled with greenery and buildings, and he did
not encounter any fighting along this route. When he reached Barqah
he made a peace treaty with its people, stipulating that they would
pay the jizyah. Afier the conquest of Barqah, its people used to send
their kharij to the governor of Egypt without anyone urging them to
do so. They were the best of people in Noah Afiica and didnot cause
any trouble.
Then after that 'Amr marched towards Tripoli, which was
strongly fortified and held a large Byzantine force. They closed its
gates and endured a siege which lasted for many months, during
which the Muslims did not manage to achieve anything. The sea lay
on the other side of the city, directly adjoining the houses; there was
no wall between the city and the sea. Some of the Muslim troops
became aware of this, so they snuck into the city kom the seaward
side and shouted takbeer. The Byzantines had no means of escape
except their ships, so 'Amr also attacked with his troops, and none of
them escaped except those who managed to get away in their ships.
The Muslims seized booty in the city, and 'Amr sent his troops into
its environs. 'Arm wanted to continue his conquests to the west and
to continue on to Tunisia and the rest of North Afiica, and he wrote to
'Umar ibn al-Khat@b about that, but the caliph was concerned about
the Muslim troops going into new territory before consolidating their
hold on the lands that they had conquered dwing their swift march
kom Syria to Tripoli. So he ordered the Muslim forces to stop at
Tripoli. Thus the Islamic state expanded during the reign of 'Umar

ibn al-Kha@b (&) to include a vast area which stretched from the
Jayhoon river and Sindh in the east to the deserts of North Aiiica m
the west, and from the mountains of Asia Minor and Armenia in the
north to the Arabian Sea and Nubia in the south. It was a single
international state, multi-racial, multi-faith, multi-cultural; its people
lived under the justice and mercy of Islam, which protected their
rights and granted them a life of dignity, despite their differences in
religion, culture and customs.'43

3. Important Lessons from the
Conquest of Egypt
3.1. The mission of 'Ubsdah ibn a ~ S h i t
al-Aqsri to al-Muqawqis
'Ann ibn al-'AS besieged the fortress of Babaliyon, and alMuqawqis sent the following letter to ' A m
"You have penetrated our land and insisted on fighting us, and you
have stayed in our land for too long. You are no more than a small
group and the Byzantines have prepared themselves and are about to
attack you; they have the equipment and weapons. This Nile is
besieging you too, and you are prisoners in our hands. Send us some
of your men so that we may listen to what they say. Perhaps we can
resolve this conflict in a way that is pleasing to both us and you, and
the fighting can stop before the Byzantines attack you, after which
there will be no room for talk and you will regret it if things turn out
differently than you had hoped. Send us some of your companions,
so that we can reach a deal with which we are both pleased."

When the envoys of al-Muqawqis came to 'Amr ibn al-'AS, he
detained them for two days and two nights, until al-Muqawqis feared
for them and said to his companions: "Do you think that they have
killed the envoys or detained them, and that they regard that as
permissible in their faith?" But all that 'Am sought to achieve by
that was to demonstrate that the Muslims were not concerned about
these proposals. Then 'Amr sent word back with the envoys: "There
are only three option between me and you: either you enter Islam and
you will be our brothers, with the same rights as us; if you refuse,
then you must pay the jizyah with willing submission, and feel
yourselves subdued (cf. Qur'an 9: 29); otherwise we will fight
against you and be patient till Allah gives judgement. And He is the
~
the envoys came back
Best of judges (cf. Qur'an 10: 1 0 9 ) . ' ~When
to al-Muqawqis he asked them: "How did you find them?" They
said, "We have seen a people to whom death is dearer than life and
humility is dearer to them than high status. Not one of them has any
desire or love for this world; rather they sit on the ground and eat on
their knees. Their leader is like one of them and those of high sratus
cannot be distinguished from the lowly nor the master from the slave.
When the time for prayer comes, not one of them stays behind. ?'hey
wash their lmbs with water and stand with humility in their prayer."
At that, al-Muqawqis said: "By the One Who may be sworn
by, if these people wanted to take on the mountains they would
destroy them. No one has the capability to fight them. If we do not
take the opporhmity to make a deal with them today whilst they are
surrounded by this Nile, they will not respond to us after today when
they manage to move out of the position where they are now." AlMuqawqis sent his envoys back to them and said: "Send some of
your envoys to us so that we may talk to them and negotiate a deal

'" 'Ubridah ibn as-S'rimif Sahdbi ICobeer wa Fritih Mujcihid, p. 91

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

327

that will be good for us and for you." 'Amr ibu al-'As sent ten men,
one of whom was 'Ubidah ibn a s - S h t . 'Amr ordered him to be the
one to speak to the people, and not to accept any deal but one of these
three options145,because the caliph had issued instructions to that
effect. ' U b W ibn a.-Shit was black, and when they travelled by
boat to al-Muqawqis and entered his place, ' U b W stepped forward
and al-Muqawqis was alarmed because of his blackness. He said,
"Take this black man away from me and let someone else come and
speak to me!" They said, "This black man is the best of us m
knowledge and wisdom. He is our leader and the best of us, and has
been appointed over us. We all refer to his opinion, and our leader bas
appointed hun over us and ordered us not to go against him." AlMuqawqis said to the delegation, "How could you accept this black
man as the best among you? Rather he should be the least among
you." They said, "No; even though he is black as you can see, he is
the best in status among us, one of the foremost among us and one of
the wisest. Blackness is not something bad among us." Al-Muqawqis
said to 'Ub%hh, "Come forward, 0' black man, and speak to me
gently, for your blackness alarms me, and if you speak harshly that
will alarm me further.." 'Ubidah went forward and said, "I have
heard what you said. Among my companions whom I left behind are
a thousand men who are all as black as me, and even blacker than me
and more terrifying to behold. If you saw them you would be even
more alarmed. My youth is gone, but nevertheless I would not be
scared if one hundred men of my enemy wanted to face me all at
once, and the same is true of my companions, for our hope and our
desire is to strive in jihad for the sake of Allah, seeking the pleasure
of Allah. The reason for our campaign against our enemies who wage
war against Allah is not the hope of worldly gains or the

'"

The options were, as stated above: becoming Muslim, paying the jizyah or
fighting.

328

The Conquests of Syria, E~gyptand Libya

accumulation of wealth, rather Allah has permitted that to us and
made the booty we acquire permissible for us. But none of us cares
whether he has a qintir of gold or has nothing but a dirham, because
all we want from this world is something to eat and ward off hunger,
and a cloth to wrap around ourselves. If one of us owns nothing more
than that, that is enough. Ifhe gets a qintdr of gold he will spend it for
the sake of Allah and be content with the little that is left in his hand,
because the pleasure of this world is not true pleasure and its luxury is
not true luxury; rather real pleasure and luxury come in the Hereafter.
This is how our Lord has guided us and our Prophet has taught us; he
advised us that our ambition in this world should be just to have
enough to ward off hunger and cover our 'awrahs;our main concern
should be to please our Lord and sbive in jihad against His enemies."
When al-Muqawqis heard that, he said to those who were
around him: "Have yon ever heard anything like what this Inan is
saying? His appearance alarmed me but his words alarm me more
than his appearance. Allah has sent this man and his companions out
to destroy the world! I think that they are bound to prevail over the
entire world."
Then al-Muqawqis turned to 'Ub2dah and said: "0'man, I
have heard what you say about yourself and your companions.
Indeed you have not achieved what you have achieved except
because of what you have mentioned, and you have only prevailed
over those over whom you have prevailed because of their love for
this world. An innumerable Byzantine force has come to us to fight
you, people who are known for their courage and toughness; none of
them cares whom he is going to meet and fight. We know that you
will not be able to tackle them, because you are weak and small in
number. You have been in our land for many months, and you are
suffering fiom hardship and lack of provisions. We feel sorry for you
because of your weakness, low numbers and lack of resources, and

'Umar ibn al-Kha<<&b

329

we will be happy to help you by giving each man among you two
dincirs; we will also give your leader one hundred dincirs and your
caliph one thousand. Take it and go back to your own land before
there comes to you a force that you cannot deal with."

' U b W ibn %-Sinit (&) said: "Do not deceive yourself or
your companions. You are trying to sc&e us by telling us about this
Byzantine force and its great numbers, and telling us that we cannot
tackle them. But this is not something that you can scare us with, and
it is not something that will make us change our plans. If what you
say is true, then by Allah, that is the most encouraging reason to fight
them, and will make us more keen to do so, because that will be more
pleasing to our Lord. If we are all killed, that will enable ns to earn
His good pleasure and attain Paradise, and there is nothing dearer to
us than that. The outcome will be good in either case. Either we will
make great gains in this world, if we defeat you, or we will make
great gains in the Hereafter, if you defeat us, and gains in the
Hereafter are dearer to us, and that is what we are striving for. Allah
says to us in His Book:
(How often a small group overcame a mighty host by AUah's Leave?
And Allah is with a$-Sribiroon [the patient].)
(Qurhn 2: 249)
There is no man among us who does not pray moming and evening
for Allah to bless him with martyrdom and not to send him back to
his wife and child. There is no one among us who womes about that
which he has left behind. Each one of us has entrusted those whom he
has left behind, wife and children, to his Lord. All our concern is
focused on what lies before us. As for your saying that we are
enduring hardship and have little provision, we are having an easy
time of it. If the whole world was ours, we would not want for
ourselves any more than what we have now. Think about what you
want to do and tell us, for there is no deal between us and we will not

330

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

accept anything from you but one of these three options. Choose
whichever one you want and do not indulge in wishful thinking. This
is what my commander has told me to do, and this is what the caliph
has commanded him to do, and this is the advice that the Messenger
of Allah @) gave to us before. Either respond to Islam, which is the
only religion that Allah will accept, and it is the religion of His
Prophets, Messengers and angels, and Allah has commanded us to
fight those who oppose it and turn away from it until they enter it;
whoever does that will have the same rights and duties as we do and
he will be our brother in the religion of Allah. If you and your
companions accept that, then you will be blessed in this world and in
the Hereafter, and we will refrain from fighting you and will not harm
you. If you refuse, then you must pay the jizyah with willing
submission, and feel yourselves subdued (cf. Qur'an 9: 29), and we
will agree on the amount ofjizyah to be paid on an annual basis, and
we will fight on your behalf anyone who attacks you or attacks any of
your land, persons or wealth. We will do that for you if you are under
our protection, and that will be a covenant that is binding upon us
before Allah. If you refuse, then there will be no option than to let the
sword decide between us and you, until we all die or we attain what
we want from you. This is our promise before Mah, and there is no
other option for us except this. Choose for yourselves."
Al-Muqawqis said: "This will never be possible. All that you
want is to enslave us as long as the earth remains." ' U b W said to
him, "It is up to you; choose what you want." Al-Muqawqis asked,
"Why can we not have an option other than these three?" 'Ubiidah
raised his hands and said, "No, by the Lord of heaven, by the Lord of
earth and the Lord of all things. You can have no other deal with us,
so choose for yourself."
Al-Muqawqis turned to his companions and asked: "Have you
decided what you want?" They said, "Would anyone accept this

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

331

humiliation? As for their wanting us to enter their religion, that can
never happen. We will not leave the religion of the Messiah, son of
Mary and enter into a religion that we do not know. As for their
wanting to imprison us and make us slaves forever, death is better
than that. If they accept for us to give them many times more than
what we have given them, that would be better." Al-Muqawqis said
to U
' bm,"The people have refused. What do you think? Go back
to your leader and tell him that we will give you many more times
what you are hoping for, and go away."

' U b W and his companions left, and al-Muqawqis said to
those who were around him:"Obey me, and let the people accept one
of these three options, for by Allah you have no power to resist them,
and if you do not respond to them willingly you will make a worse
deal with them unwillingly." They asked him, 'Which option should
we choose?' He said, "I shall tell you. As for entering another
religion, I would not tell you to do that. As for fighting them, I know
that you will never he able to prevail over them, and you will never
persevere as they do. So there is nothing left hut the third option."
They said, "So we will be enslaved to them forever?" He said, "Yes,
being slaves, but with full authority in your land, knowing that you,
your wealth and your children are safe, is better then all of you dying,
and being slaves, sold and scattered throughout the land and enslaved
forever, you and your families and children." They said, 'Death is
preferable to that."'46
From this dialogue that took place between 'Ubidah and alMuqawqis, we can see the smartness of 'Ubidah and his
understanding of what his opponent was aiming at, and he was not
influenced by these methods that he used to try to affect the outcome.
During this discussion, 'UbW did not forget to call al-Muqawqis to

Islam and encourage him to enter the faith, and to demonstrate the
openness of the Muslims towards other nations and religions, which

3.2.1. Psychological warfare
When al-Muqawqis commanded the women to stand on the
walls of Babaliyon, facing inwards, and he made the armed men
stand facing towards the Muslims to terrify them, 'Amr sent word to
him saying: "We have seen what you have done, but it is not by our
numbers that we have defeated our enemies. We met your king
(emperor) and you know what happened to him." Al-Muqawqis said
to his companions: "These people are speaking the truth. They
expelled our king &om his kingdom and drove him back to
Constantinople. We should submit."'48 'Amr was one of the leaders
who used psychological warfare to terrify the enemy and reduce their
fighting spirit. In wartime he relied first on Allah, then on his
smartness and military skills to achieve a single goal, which was a
decisive victory at the end of the battle.149

3.2.2. Ambushes and surprise attacks
'Amr also used the methods of ambush and surprise attacks in
the battie of 'Ayn Shams. He made solid preparations which made it
easy to achieve complete success. He sent ambush units by night to
take up specific positions, which he chose well, and specified the
time when they should launch their attacks, when the enemy was
preoccupied with the battle, whereupon these units were to attack
from right and left. He chose the right times and the right places to
attack the enemy. Thus his ambush manoeuvres during this battle are
regarded as being among the most successful of ambush
operations.'50

3.2.3. Ambushes during the siege
'Amr also succeeded in using ambush tactics during the siege
of Babaliyon. Whilst the Byzantines were certain that the Muslims
would not to be able to cause them any harm because of their strong
fortifications and walls, and their ample supplies of provisions and
weaponry, md because of the barriers they had erected with spikes on
the gates of the fortress, and the ditch that had dried up when the level
of the Nile dropped, they were taken by surprise one night when azZubayr ibu al-'Awwh and a group of fighters climbed the walls,
shouting takbeer, and caught them unawares, wielding their swords.
The defenders in the fortress were defeated and sought a peace treaty
and promises of safety, and the Muslims entered the fortress
victorious.'51

3.2.4. Patience in laying siege
During the sieges of Kiryoon and Alexandria, 'Amr relied on
patience. When he realized that it would be difficult to achieve
victory over the Byzantines who had holed up in their fortress in
Kiryoon, he tried once to launch an attack, but the attack failed. So he
continued with skirmishes and waited for the passage of time, the
defenders' weariness, and the exhaustion of supplies and arms and
men's patience to take effect. This is indeed what happened. After the
siege of Kiryoon had lasted for more than ten days, the Byzantines
realized that the Muslims were determined to carry on with the siege,
then they realized that they had no alternative but to snrrender and
hand over the fortress to the attackers. The same thing happened
during the siege of Alexandria, except that in the latter case the siege
lasted for a longer time (three months), because the Byzantnes were
fully aware that this was the last chance for their army and ndeed for
all of them; if they fell in Alexandria then they would fall in Egypt
and all of North Africa, and this is exactly what did happen.15'

3.3. Sending the good news
of the conquest to the caliph
'Amr ibn al-'As sent Mu'iwiyah ibn Khadeej to 'Umar ibn alK h a e b with the good news of the conquest. Mu'iwiyah said to him:
"Why don't you write a letter to send with me?" ' A m said to him:
"Why do I need to write a letter? Are you not an Arab man who can
convey the message? Did you not see everything?" When he came to
'Umar he told him of the conquest of Alexandria, and 'Umar fell
down in prostration and said, "Praise be to Allah." Mu'iwiyah ibn
Khadeej told of how he conveyed the good news of the victory to the

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

335

caliph: "When 'Amr ibn al-'AS sent me to 'Umar ibn al-Khaftib, I
reached the mosque and whilst I was sitting there, a slave woman
came out of the house of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb and saw me looking
tired, wearing travelling clothes. She came to me and asked, 'Who
are you?' I said, 'I am Mu'iwiyah ibn Khadeej, the envoy of 'Amr
ibn al-'&.' She went away, then she came rushing back and I could
hear the rustling of her izrir against her legs. When she came up to me
she said, 'Get up and answer the caliph, for his is calling you.' I
followed her and when she went in, there I saw 'Umar ibn al-Khagb,
holding his ndd' in one hand and tying his izrir with the other. He
asked, 'What (news) do you have?' I said, 'Good news, 0' Ameer alMu 'mineen. Allah has granted us victory in Alexandria.' He took me
out to the mosque, and said to the mu'adh-dhin, 'Call out to the
people, 'a:-Salritu Jrimi 'ah brayer is about to begin)'.' Then he said
to me, 'Stand up and tell your companions.' So I stood up and told
them, then he prayed and went into his house, and turned to face the
qiblah and said du '6'. Then he sat down and said, '0' slave woman,
is there any food?' She brought some bread and oil, and he said,
'Eat.' I ate only a little because I felt shy. He said, 'Eat, for the
traveller loves food. If I wanted to eat, I would eat with you.' I felt
shy but I ate a little. Then he said, 'What did you say, 0' Mu'iwiyah,
when you came to the mosque?' I said, 'I thought, perhaps the caliph
is taking a nap.' He said, 'That is not the right thing to say - or to
think -if I slept during the day I would have neglected the people,
and if I slept during the night I would have neglected myself. How
can I sleep when I have these two concerns, 0' M~'iwiyah?'"'~~
From this report we may conclude that the mosque in the
earliest period of Islam was the most imporkmt means of conveying
infannation, as the Muslims would gather there when they heard the
l S 3 Fufooh M i s ~
wa al-Maghrib, p. 105; Fafh Misr bayna ar-Ru'yah alIslimiyah wa ar-Ru'yah an-Nqsiniyah by Dr. Ibtiheem al-Mutaniwi, p. 114.

336

The Conquests of Syria, E~gyptand Libya

call, "a$-Salitu Jimi'ah (prayer is about to begin)". This call meant
that there was some important information to be conveyed to the
Muslims. When they gathered, military, political or social statements
would be read out to them. We also learn from this report something
about the life of 'Umar (&) when he was the caliph of the Muslims,
as he said to ~ u ' 2 w i ~ aihn
k Khadeej: "If I slept during the day I
would have neglected the people, and if I slept during the night I
would have neglected myself. How can I sleep when I have these two
concerns, 0' MuC2wiyah?"This points to his complete awareness of
the rights of his own self and the rights of others. If a Muslim can
combine both, then he will be one of the righteous and

3.4. 'Umar's keenness to fulfil promises
When the Muslims reached Bilheeb and their prisoners
reached Yemen, their governor sent word to 'Amr ihn al-'As saying:
"I used to give the jizyah to those who were more hated to me than
you, the Persians and the Byzantines. If you want me to pay the
jizyah in return for giving hack to me what you have taken of my
land, I will do that." 'Amr wrote to 'Umar asking him for permission
to do that, and they suspended fighting until they received 'Umar's
response. The answer came back from 'Umar: "Indeed, ongoing
jzzyah is dearer to us than booty which is divided and then is as if it
never existed. As for the prisoners, if their king gives you jizyah on
condition that you give the prisoners the choice between Islam and
the religion of their people, then whoever chooses Islam is one of the
Musllms and whoever chooses the religion of his people, impose the
jizyah on him. As for those who are scattered m other lands, we
cannot return them. 'Amr made this offer to the ruler of Alexandria

L54 At-Tdreekh al-Islrimi by al-Hameedi, 11-121348, 349.

'Umar ibn al-Khanbb

337

and he accepted it. They gathered the prisoners and the Christians
gathered, and they gave them the choice one by one. When someone
chose Islam they said takbeer, and when someone chose Christianity
they groaned and imposed the jizyah, until they were finished.'55
This is regarded as evidence of the sincerity of the Sahribah
(may Allah be pleased with them), as they were unconcerned about
worldly affairs and were focused on the Hereafter. They were
genuinely keen to guide people to Islam, because the prisoners'
entering Islam did not bring the Muslims any benefit in worldly
tenns, whereas if they continued to follow their religion that would
bring some worldly gains, as they would be obliged to pay jizyah to
the Muslims. Despite that we see 'Umar (4)
ordering that the
prisoners be given the choice between becoming Muslim or paying
thejizyah. When that order was implemented, the Sahribah and those
who were with them said takbeer with more fervour than they had
during the conquests whenever one of those Christians chose Islam,
and they were distressed when someone chose to continue following
his religion.
It is also worth noting the commitment of the Sah6bah to the
deal that had been worked out, which is clear kom the statement of
'Umar (&) in his letter: "As for those who are scattered in other
lands, we cannot return them." According to another report, he said:
"We do not want to make a peace deal with him that is based on
conditions that we cannot fulfil."156 'Umar looked at his ability to
fulfil conditions before concluding any deal with the enemy, so that
the Muslims would not be in a position of being unable to fulfil the
conditions. This attitude is indicative of the high degree of sincerity
- which is one of the elements of victory
because the one who

commits himself to something and then is unable to fulfil it may be
excused, but if he thinks about it and tries to take precautions so that
he will not find himself unable to M 1 the conditions, this is a sign of
foresight and good management.'"

3.5. 'Abddiih ibn 'Arnr ibn al-'As. (&,)
.
'Amr set offwith his m y towards Alexandria, and on the way
there was some fighting between him and the people of that land, in
which the Muslims were victorious. It may be noted that 'Abdulla
ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As was wounded many times in his battles with the
people of al-Kiryoon. A messenger came to him from his father to
ask him about his wounds and 'Abdullib said in verse:

"I say to myself when the pain grows intense,
Be patient, for soon you will be praised or blamed."
The messenger went back to 'Amr and told him what he had said. ,
'Amr said: "He is tmly my son."'58
This was an attitude of patience and forbearance on the part of
'Abdulla ibn 'Amr ibn at-'AS, who was well known for his
knowledge and worship, which he combined with courage and
patience in the face of hardship.IS9

3.6. A house that was built for the caliph in Egypt
'Amr ibn al-'& sent word to 'Umar, telling him: "We have
built a house for you next to the Jimi' mosque." 'Umar wrote back

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

339

saying: "I am a man who lives in the Hijib. Why would I have a
house in Egypt?" and he commanded him to make it into a
marketplace for the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~ ~

This is indicative of the restraint of the caliph 'Umar (&), and
his asceticism with regard to outward worldly matters. If leaders and
rulers put themselves above the matters of this world and its transient
pleasures, then it is more appropriate that those who are below them
should also shun such things.16'

3.7. The claim that the Muslims
burnt the library of Alexandria
Dr. 'Abdur-R&eem Muhammad 'Abdul-Hameed said: "We
did not find any text or indication that 'Amr ibu al-'A$ burned the
library of Alexandria. All there is, is a text by Ibn al-Qa@, quoting
from Ibu al-'Abari (d. 685 A.H.11286 C.E.) which says: "Yahya alNalpwi - who was om Alexandria and lived until the city of
Alexandria was conquered by 'Amr ibn al-'As -went to see 'Arnr.
He was known for his knowledge, so 'Amr honoured him and heard
from h i philosophical words with which the Arabs were not
familiar." Ibu al-Qa@ completed the story by saying: " 'Amr said to
him, 'What do you want h m us?' He said, 'The books of wisdom
that are in the royal stores' ... forty-five thousand, one hundred and
twenty volumes. 'Amr thought that what Yahya had mentioned was
too much, and he said, 'I cannot issue such an order without asking
permission from the caliph.' He wrote to 'Umar and told him what
Y&ya had said, and 'Umar wrote back, saying: 'As for the books
which you have mentioned, if what is in them is in accordance with

340

The Conquests of Synyna,
Egypt and Libya

the Book of Allah, then we should be content with the Book of Allah.
If what is in them is conto the Book of Allah, then we have no
need of them. So go ahead and destroy them.' ' A m ibn al-'A$ started
distributing the books to the bath-houses of Alexandria, where they
were burned in the stoves, and I was told the number of bath-houses
at that time, but I forgot. They said that it took six months to bum
them all, so listen to what happened and be ama~ed."'~'
But this story of the book-burning was narrated before Ibn alQaqi and before Ibn al-'Ahari. 'Abdul-Lateef al-Baghdidi (d. 649
A.H.11231 C.E.) said: "It was a house of knowledge that was built by
Alexander when he built the city, in which were stored the books that
were burned by 'Amr ibn al-'AS with the permission of 'Umar ibn alKha@b
But if we study these reports, we must note the following points:
1. There is no connection between these three reports or between
their narrators, even though they lived in a similar time frame.

2. There is no isnad to which these reports can be attributed; rather
they reflect assumptions that are made by their authors.
3. These reports were written at a time that was distant fiom the
conquest of Egypt and the time of 'Amr ibn al-'A$. So we may say
with all certainty that this story is obviously fabricated and the
following criticisms may be made:
4. The story of the burning of the library of Alexandria is not
mentioned by those who wrote the history of Egypt and its conquest,
who lived many centuries before those who wrote this story.
5. This story is not mentioned by al-Wiqidi, at-Tabari, Ihn al-Atheer
or Ibn Khaldoon, let alone Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam, and it is not

mentioned by Yaqoot al-Hamawi in his description of Alexandria.
6. This story can be traced back to the time of the Crusades, through
al-Baghdadi, who may have fabricated it under pressure, or it may
have been fabricated later on and attributed to him.

7. If this so-called library ever existed, then we may say that the
Byzantines who left Alexandria could have taken it with them, and
they probably did do that.
8. 'Amr could have thrown the books into the sea within a very short
time, instead of burning them, which supposedly took six months.
This points to the purpose behind the fabrication of this story. We can
say without any hesitation that 'Umar ibn al-Khagb and 'Amr ibn
al-'AS are innocent of what has been attributed to them in this
fabricated story, which stems from the imaginations of people who
love to exaggerate, so they imagined things that did not happen.'"

3.8. The meeting between 'Amr ibn al-'As
and the Patriarch Binysmeen
The historian Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam said: "In Alexandria there
was a Coptic bishop called Abu Binyheen, who had fled into the
desert because of the religious persecution that the Copts were
suffering at the hands of the Christian Byzantines. When he heard
that 'Amr ibn al-'Av had come to Egypt, he wrote to the Copts, telling
them that the Byzantines no longer had a hold on power and theu
dominion had come to an end, and he told them to welcome 'Amr. It
was said that the Copts who were in al-Farrna became helpers of
'Amr on that day.165According to a report by the Coptic historian

The Conquests of Syria, Egvpt and Libya

Sawirns ibn al-Muqanna, Sanutius, one of the Coptic leaders at that
time, who was in charge of church affairs during the absence of the
Patriarch Binyameen, told ' A m where the Patriarch Binyheen was,
and that he had fled kom the Byzantines, fearing them. 'Amr ibn al'As wrote a letter to his agents in Egypt, telling them where
Binyheen, the Patriarch ofthe Christian Copts, was, and that he had
a covenant and a promise of protection and safety kom Allah, so let
him come in safety and tend to the affairs of his church and his
people. When the bishop Binyheen heard of that, he returned to
Alexandria with great joy, after having been absent for thirteen years.
When he appeared, the people and the entire city rejoiced at his
coming. When 'Amr leamed of his arrival, he ordered that he be
brought to him with full honour and respect, and when he saw h i
he honoured him and said to his companions: "In all the cities that we
have taken possession of, up till now I have not seen a man like this."
The Patriarch Binyheen was very handsome and well spoken, with
a tranquil and dignified manner. Then ' A m turned to him and said:
'TTake care of all your churches and men; they are all under your
control and you may manage their affairs."
Professor ash-Sharqiwi commented on this meeting by
saying: " 'Amr kept the Patriarch Binyheen close to him until he
became one of his dearest fiiends, and the Arabs who had conquered
Egypt began to feel at ease. Their governor 'Amr ibn al-'AS
addressed them on the occasion of the first Jumu'ah prayers in alFus@ and said, 'Treat the Copts who are your neighbours well, for
you owe them protection and are connected to them by marriage. So
refrain kom harming them, r e h i n kom looking at their womenfok
and lower your gaze.'"'66

4. Important Lessons from the
Conquests of 'Umar
4.1. The nature of the Islamic conquests
Some Orientalist and Christian historians have attempted to
misrepresent the Islamic conquests at the time of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphs. They claimed that the conquests were religious wars and
said that the Muslims were people of faith but they were fanatics who
subjugated the people and made them accept their principles by
s
They claim that
means of force and indulging in ~ t h l e s bloodshed.
they carried the Qur'an in one hand and the sword in the other.I6'
Among those who focused on this idea were Sidio, Muir and Nipur.
Muir quotes Nipur as saying: "For the survival of Islam, it was
essential that it continue with its aggressive plans and enforce by the
sword its demand that all people enter Islam, or at least spread its
influence internationally. But it is inevitable for any religion that its
followers will prefer war at some stage, and this was the case with
Islam."
But the claim that the Muslims aimed to spread their faith by
force or that they were more aggressive than others, is a claim that
must be completely reje~ted.'~' Some Orientalists refuted thls
accusation and descnbed the Islamic conquests as being based on a
sublime attitude. Von Kremer says: "In their wars, the Muslim Arabs
embodied good attitudes. The Prophet &,) forbade them to kill
monks, women, children and the blind or handicapped, as he also
forbade them to destroy crops or cut down trees. The Muslims

followed these instructions to the letter in their wars. They did not
violate any sanctuary or destroy any crops. The Byzantines used to
shoot poisoned arrows at them, but they did not respond in kind
against their enemy. Pillaging towns and setting fire to them was the
normal practice of the Byzantine army, whether it was advancing or
retreating, but the Muslims adhered to their ideals and did not try to
do any of these things."169
Rosenthal said: "The Islamic state expanded into other lands,
calling others to the faith, and engaging in debate with other
intellectual movements that were in existence. But above all, the
advance of Islam demolished the ancient barriers of language and
custom, and provided a rare opportunity to all peoples and
civilizations to start a new intellectual life that was based on absolute
equality, in a spirit of kee ~om~etition.""~
The historical reality shows that the Muslims did not force
anyone to embrace Islam, because they adhered to the words of Allah:
4There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has
become distinct kom the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in
Ttghoot [false goods, idols, etc.] and believes in Allah, then he has
grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And
Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.)
(Qnr'an 2: 256)
The reason why people converted to Islam was what they saw
in Islam itself, which was a great blessing, and what they saw in the
Muslims who embodied Islamic attitudes and adhered to the
teachings, commands and prohibitions of the faith, and what they
saw in the commanders and troops who called others by means of
their deeds and actions. The attitude of the soldiers was the noblest

attitude ever known in the history of the world. The caliphs and
commanders urged their troops to seek the help of Allah and to fear
Him, to give precedence to the Hereafter over this world, to be
sincere in jihad, to seek the pleasure of Allah in whatever they did,
and to keep away from sin. They had a strong desire to save nations
and individuals from servitude to other people so that they might
become slaves of Allab, and to bring them out of the constrictions of
this world to the vastness of the Hereafter. The Muslim leaders
marched at the head of their armies, receiving the first blows in the
battles of jihad, and many of them were martyred. And the leaders
used to march at the back of the army at times of safety, so as to show
kindness to them, carry burdens and help the weak. The leaders were,
first and foremost, dd'iyahs who implemented the principles of
Islamic warfare in full.Indeed, the Muslims fought in jihad for the
sake of Allah and did not wage war as other states used to do.17'

4.2. 'Umar's method of selecting
commanders for the army
'Umar had a distinct method of selecting leaders for the
conquest. He stipulated a number of conditions and guidelines for
choosing commanders for his troops, which were as follows:

4.2.1. They should be pious and righteous,
with knowledge of Islamic rulings
He used to say, "Whoever appoints an evildoer knowing that
he is an evildoer, is just like him."'" When he sent word to Sa'eed

ibn 'h,
appointing him as governor in some part of Syria, Sa'eed
refused the post. 'Umar said: "No, by the One in Whose band is my
soul, do not lay all the burden on my shoulders and sit in your

house^.""^
4.2.2. The commander should be known
for deliberation and caution
When 'Umar appointed Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi, he said to
him: 'Wothing prevented me fiom appointing Sulayt except the fact
that he rushed to fight, and rushing to fight may lead to loss, except
when it is based on sound calculation. By Allah, were it not for his
haste, I would have appointed h i but nothing is right in war except
deliberati~n.""~

4.2.3. He should be daring and brave,
and skilled in archery

the people and they said: "0'

them." He said, "By Allah, I shall appoint over them a man who will
be the most courageous in battle when they meet the enemy
tomomow." They asked, "Who is it, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mmeen?" He
said, "An-Nu'mh ibn Muqrin al-Muzani." They said, "He is able for

4.2.4. He should be intelligent and wise
'Umar (&) said: 'Your right over me is that I should never
send you on a fatal mission or keep you at the border posts for too
long."177 When 'Amribn al-'AS and his troops faced the Byzantines
was
in the battle of Ajnadeen, the Byzantine commander al-*boon
the smartest of the Byzantines, a man of deep insight and cunning,
who had assembled a huge asmy in Aeelia' and Ramlah. 'Amr wrote
to 'Umar with the news, and when his letter arrived, 'Umar said: "We
have sent the Amboon of the Arabs against the Amboon of the

wanted to gather information about al-Ar@boonand his army, so that
he could devise a wise plan of attack and defeat him, Ibn al-'AS
entered the camp of the Byzantine leader and was almost killed, but
Allah saved him. 'Amr ibn al-'Ag ticked al-Ar@boon, and when
news of that reached 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb he said: " 'Amr has
defeated him, what a smart man 'Amr is!"179

4.2.5. The commander should be smart and eloquent,
with military insight and experience
The author of al-Mughni (Ibn Qudimah al-Hanbali) said,
when speaking of military commanders: "(The commander should
be) wise, chivalrous, with howledge of war and insight into the
enemy's next move. He should be trustworthy, kind and sincere

4.2.6. He should be keen to do the job
Part of 'Umar's plan was not to appoint any man to do a job
that he did not want to do and concerning which he had no
conviction, unless he had no other choice, so that the job would be
done in a proficient manner. On one occasion he urged the people to
fight the Persians, hut no one stood up (to volunteer). The next day,
he repeated his plea, and no one stood up. On the third day he
repeated his plea, and again no one stood up. When the fourth day
came, the first one to volunteer was Abn 'Ubayd ibn Mas'ood athThaqafi, then the people followed his lead. He appointed Abu
'Ubayd in charge of them, as he was qualified for that position even
though he was not a Sahibi. It was said to 'Umar: "Why didn't you
appoint a man kom among the Sahibah in charge of them?" He said,
"I have appointed over them the one who responded first."'81 These
qualities were embodied in Sa'd ihn Ahi Waqqis, Abu 'Ubaydah ibn
al-Jar& 'Amr ihn al-'As and many others.

4.3. The rights of Allah, the leaders and
troops, as derived from the letters of 'Umar
4.3.1. The rights of Allah
In his letters and exhoaations, 'Umar reminded his
commanders and troops of the importance of upholding the rights of
Allah, among the most important of which are:

Enduring and being more patient than the enemy
Allah, the Exalted, the Almighty says:

'Umar ibn al-Khattdb

349

$0'you who believe! Endure and be more patient [than your enemy],
and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the
places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allah, so that
you may be successful.8
(@r 'an 3. 200)
When he sent Sa'd ibn Abi al-Waqqh to Iraq, he reminded
him of the importance of patience and said: "Remember that every
good action requires a certain quality. Good actions require patience
in bearing whatever befalls you or strikes you. If you have patience
' ~ ~also wrote to 'Ubaydah ibn Abi althen you will feat ~ l l a h . " He
Jam& when he was in Syria, saying: "Allah praised people for their
patience, as He said:

(And many a Prophet [i.e. many from amongst the Prophets] fought
[in Allah's Cause] and along with him [fought] large bands of
religious leamed men. But they never lost heart for that which did
befall them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken nor degrade
themselves. And Allah loves as-Scibiroon [the patient]. And they said
nothing but, 'Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and our transgressions [in
keeping our duties to You], establish our feet firmly, and give us
victory over the disbelieving folk. So Allah gave them the reward of
this world, and the excellent reward of the HereaRer. And Allah loves
al-Mubinoon [the good-doers].')
(@r 'an 3: 146-148)
The reward of this world is booty and conquest, and the reward
of the Hereafter is forgiveness and Paradise." He read this letter out
to the people and told them to fight for the sake of Allah and to be
patient so that AUah might give them the reward of this world and the
excellent reward of the erea after."^

Tdreekh Futooh ash-Shdm, p. 183.

350

The Conquests of Syria, E~gyptand Libya

Their intention when fighting should be
to support the religion of Allah
'Umar (&) understood the words of the Messenger of Allah
@J: (("Whoever fights so that the word of Allah may be supreme is
(fighting) for the sake of AUah."))'84 So we see that his life, his
advice and his letters were governed by this important concept.

Fulfilling the trust
Allah, the All-Compassionate, All-Merciful says:
(It is not for any Prophet to take illegally a part of the booty
[Ghuloofl, and whosoever deceives his companions as regards the
booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he
took [illegally]. Then every person shall be paid in full what he has
earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.) (Qur'an 3: 161)
Among 'Umar's advice to his commanders and troops was not
to steal from the war booty before it was distributed, as he said:
"When you meet the enemy, do not flee, and when you seize booty,
do not steal from it."'85

No room for favouritism in supporting the religion of Allah
One ofthe most famous sayings of 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (&)
concerning favouritism is: "Whoever appoints a man because of
favomitism or blood ties, and does not appoint him for any other
reason, has betrayed AUah and His Messenger, and whoever appoints
an evildoer knowing that he is an evildoer, is just like him."lS6

351

4.3.2. The rights of the commander
'Umar stated in his letters and commands the rights of the
commander, which include the following:
Constant obedience
When 'Umar sent Abu 'Ubayd ibn Mas'ood ath-Thaqafi to
Iraq as the head of the m y , he sent with him Salamah ibn Aslam alKhazraji and Sulafl ibn Qays al-An@ (may AUah be pleased with
them both), and commanded him not to take any decision without
consulting them. He told him that they were from among the people
of Badr. Then Abu 'Ubayd fought the Persians in the battle of the
bndge. Sulafl had advised him not to destroy the bridge and not to
cross over to where the Persians were, but he did not pay attention to
him, which led to the defeat of the Muslim troops. Sulayt said: "Were
it not that I do not like to be disobedient, I would have told the people
to disobey him,but I listen and I obey."187

They should entrust their afairs to those
c h g e d with authority among them
Allah, the AU-Powerful says:
t&Vhen there comes to them some matter touching [public] safety or
fear, they make it known [among the people]; if only they had
referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among
them, the proper investigators would have understood it kom them
[directly]. Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of AUab upon
you, you would have followed Shaytrin [Satan], save a few of you.)
(Qur'an 4: 83)

Allah made the people's entrusting their affairs to those
charged with authority among them one of the means of reaching the

352

The Conquests of @ria, Egypt and Libya

right decision. If they think that a better way is hidden from their
leader, they should point it out to him and advise him to follow it.
Hence consultation is recommended in order to find the correct
way.'*' 'Umar appointed a single leader for the troops so that they
might entmst their affairs to him, and so that they would not have
conflicting points of view that might result in division.189

In the year in which 'Umar sent the Muslim armies to
Nahawand and commanded them to gather there, the armies
consisted of the troops &om Madeenah, both Muhijimon and h s k ,
under the leadership of 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar ibn al-KhaE2b (&), the
troops of Bqrah under the leadership of Abu Moosa al-Ash'axi (&),
and the troops of Koofa under the leadership of Hudhayfah ihn alYamh (4).
Affer they had gathered, 'Umar (&) wrote to them
saying: "When you meef your commander is an-Nu'& ibn Muqrin

Hastening to obey his commands
During the caliphate of 'Umar ibn al-KhaG2b (&), the first
thing he did was urge the people to fight the Persians. He started
calling them for three days, but no one responded. On the fourth day,
the fust one to respond was Abu 'Ubayd ibu Mas'ood ath-Thaqafi,
which led 'Umar to appoint him in charge of that mission, even
though there were Companions of the Messenger of Allah &J there,
because he had hastened to answer the call.191
When 'Umar sent 'Utbah ibn Ghazwk to Basra, he said to
him, advising and reminding him: "Fear AUah with regard to what

you have been appointed to do, and beware of being inclined towards
arrogance that would spoil your bond with your brothers. You were a
Companion of the Messenger of Allah &); you have been honoured
aRer being humiliated, and yon have become strong after being
weak, and now you have become a commander with authority and a
leader who is obeyed; when you speak you are listened to and when
you issue orders you are obeyed. What a blessing that is, provided
that you do not feel yourself to be more than you are and do not look
down on others."'92
Not arguing about the distribution of booty
Concerning the distribution of booty, one of the things that
'Umar said was: "0' Allah, I call upon You to bear witness over the
governors of the regions, for I have only sent them to teach the people
their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet, to divide the fay' and
to be fair to them. Whoever is confused about any matter should refer
to me."193
During the conquest of al- blah'^^, when the booty was
shared out among the troops, the share of one of them was a pot of
copper. When he took possession of it, he realized that it was made of
gold. The other soldiers noticed that and complained to the
commander.195He did not know what to do, so he wrote to 'Umar
(&), telling him about that. The reply came back: "If he insists that
he did not know that it was gold until after he took possession of it,
and he swears to that effect, then give it to him. If he refuses (to
swear) then divide it among the Muslims." He swore the oath and it
was given to him.196When the booty was gathered in the battle of

Jaloola', Jareer ibn 'Abdulliih al-Bajali said that one-quarter of it was
for him and his people. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& (4)
wrote to 'Umar
ibn al-KhaGb about that, and 'Umar said: "Jareer has spoken the
truth. I said to him that if he thinks that he and his people fought in
return for the share of those whose hearts are to be softened, then give
them their share, but if they fought for the sake of Allah and His
religion, seeking that which is with Him, then they are Muslims, with
the same rights and duties as other Muslims." When the letter came
to Sa'd he told Jareer about that, and Jareer said: "The Ameer alMu 'mineenhas spoken the truth. We have no need of the one-quarter,
rather we are among the Muslim."

4.3.3. The rights of the troops
In his letters and words of advice, 'Umar explained the rights
of the troops, which included the following:

Inspecting the troops and checking on them
It is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb said: "I draw up plans
to prepare my m y when I am in a state of prayer." This is because
'Umar was enjoined, as caliph, to be involved in jihad, so he was the
commander ofjihad, so in that regard he was like one who offers the
fear prayer whilst facing the enemy.197 When he appointed
commanders, before he sent them out he would inspect them and
advise them. Among the things that he used to say to them was,
'Wear your izirs and rida k, wear shoes and dress properly; engage in
target practice and learn to ride horses well. Follow the way of the
Arabs and avoid the luxurious styles of the non-Arabs.' You will
continue to be strong so long as you practice horseback riding and

!

'Umar ibn al-Khat@b

355

This shows us the extent of 'Umar's keenness to prepare h a
asmy well and show their strength. His commanders followed his
example by liming up their troops and inspecting them, and making a
show of strength before the enemy, whether that was in battle or
during the preparations for battle. ' A m ibn al-'A? would address his
troops in Egypt during Jumu 'ahprayers and urge them to fatten their
mounts; he warned them that they would not be given their salary if
they did not do that. He said: "I do not want to hear that a man has
fattened his own body and left his horse lean. Remember that I am
going to inspect the horses as I inspect the men. Whoever d e s his
horse lean with no reason, I will deduct &om his salary
accordingly."199
When Mu'gwiyah met 'Umar upon his arrival in Syria, 'Umar
saw him living like a king. He denounced him for that and asked:
"Are you behaving like Chosroes, 0' Mu'%wiyah?" He said, "0'
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, we are on the &ontier, facing the enemy, and
we need to compete with them in the adornment of war and jihad."
'Umar remained silent and did not tell him that he was wrong,
- as the
purpose explained to him had to do with supporting the truth and the
faith?''

Kindness towards the troops during the march
'Umar wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqg~(&) saying: "Be kind to
the Muslims during their march, and do not force them to march to
the point of exhaustion. Strive to make stops in suitable places, so
that they may reach the enemy without losing any of their strength.
For they are headed towards an enemy who is settled, whose troops
and horses are well rested. Give them one day and one night off every
week, so that they may rest and revitalize themselves, and put down

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

their weapons and equipment. Make your stops m places that are far
away &om the cities with which you have peace treaties."z0'
When 'Umar sent reinforcements to the troops in Syria, he
gave them mounts and provisions, and appointed Sa'eed ibn 'h
in
charge of them. When they were about to set off, 'Umar said: "Wait a
minute, until I tell you something." Then 'Umar went towards the
army on foot, and said to him, "0' Sa'eed, I have appointed you over
this army, but you are not the best of them, unless you fear Allah.
When you march, be as kind to them as you can; do not impugn their
honour or look down on the young ones among them. Do not show
favouritism to the strong among them, and do not lead them through
caves. Take them through the plains and do not stop on any major
road. I entrust you and the Muslims with you to the care of Allah."202

Checking on them before they head rmt
'Umar used to mspect the troops before they headed out and
advise them to adopt a noble attitude and uphold noble values. He
ordered Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqQ to fulfil promses made to the enemy if
they requested safe passage, and not to betray them. He told h i that
mistakenly betraylug a man would be a cause of doom and wealmess
for him and a source of strength for the enemy, and he warned him
agamst becoming a source of shame and weakness for the
~uslims.~~~

Not tying to deal with one who opposes him at the time of
meeting the enemy, lest that lead to division and defeat

commanders was the following: 'The leader of an army or a

When 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib (&) sent S a h i b ibn Rabee'ah
al-Bibili at the head of an m y , he sent with him 'Amr ibn
Ma'diyakrib and Tulaylyh ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi. Some argument
arose between 'Amr ibn Ma'diyakrib and Salmk ibn Rabee'ah, and
news of that reached 'Umar (&). 'Umar wrote to him saying, "I
have heard what you did to 'Am, and that was not right. If I was in
your position in a situation of war, I would look at 'Amr and
Tulayhah and bring them close and listen to them, for they have
knowledge and experience of war. Then when you reach the Muslim
lands you may regard them as they regard themselves, and draw close
~ ~ ~he wrote to 'Amr ibn
to the people of fiqh and ~ u r ' a n . "And
Ma'diyakrib saying: "I have heard about your arguing with your
commander and insulting him. I have heard that you have a sword
called apSamshah. WeLl I have a sword called al-Musammim and I
swear by Allah that if I strike you with it, that will be the end of you."
When this letter reached 'Amr he said: "By Allah, if he decided to, he
would indeed use it."'06
It is clear fiom these two texts that 'Umar fully understood
how a commander should behave in hostile territory, creating
harmony among his troops, especially when they were about to
conf?ont the enemy, and he understood that the leader should consult
those who have experience of war, and that this does not mean that
the relationship of love between them should end when they return to
the territory where there is peace.

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

During the conquest of a r - ~ i h a ~ which
~ ' , was achieved at the
hand of 'Iyid ibn Ghanam, reinforcements came to him &om Syria,
led by Bisr ibn Abi Arta'ah a l - ' d , sent by Yazeed ibn Abi
Suiiyh on the instruction of 'Umar (&). A dispute arose between
them whilst they were in enemy territo&. ' I y g had no need for the
reinforcements, so he asked him to go back to Syria. 'Umar (&)
wrote to ' I y g asking h m to explain the reason why he had sent them
back, especially since they had only come to help him and to give the
impression to the enemy that reinforcements were coming one after
another, so as to weaken their resolve and hasten their submission.
' I y g replied, "I was a h i d that there might be rebellion and disunity
among the troops, and because I had no need for reinforcements, I
apologized to him and told him to go back. This is the reason why I
sent him back."20s 'Umar approved of that and prayed for him,
especially as they were facing the enemy, so as to avoid creating
division and disputes that would lead to

Keeping watch lest the enemy catch them unawares
whilst stopping and when on the march
'Umar was very concerned with the issue of keeping watch,
hence he ordered his commanders to be very careful lest the enemy
attack them or catch them unawares. He asked them to appoint
guards whenever they stopped and when they were on the move. He
also advised them to send scouts and spies in all directions when
reaching the land of the enemy, so that they would acquire full
knowledge of the enemy's land and their intentions. He wrote to Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqh saying: "When you enter the land of the enemy, send
scouts between you and them, and be fully aware of their situation.

You should have with you Arabs and local people whom you trust
and h o w to be sincere, for information brought by a liar will be of no
benefit to you, even if some of what he says is true. A traitor is a spy
against you, not for you. When you approach the enemy's land, you
should send out many scouts and small detachments who can cut off
the enemy's reinforcements and supply l'mes, and find their weak
points. Choose as scouts people who are wise and tough from among
your companions, and give them fast horses, so that if they meet the
enemy, the first impression will be one of strength."z10
From this valuable advice, it is clear to us that the caliph 'Umar
(&) was not concerned only with sending spies against the enemy,
rather he also used spies as a means of keeping an eye on the
administrativeaffairs of the Muslun army by watching his governors,
agents, commanders and troops, so that he would know what was
happening among them and how the military campaign was being
run.He had spies in every army and camp who sent him reports about
what was happening.z11
'Umayr ibn Sa'd al-Anski complained to the caliph 'Umar;
when he came to him among a group of people from Syria, he said:
"0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, between us and the Byzantines there is a
city called 'Arabsoos. Its people tell our enemies all about our weak
points, but they do not tell us anything about their weak points."
'Umar said to him: "When you reach it, give its people the choice
between being given two sheep for every sheep, two camels for every
camel, two of everything in return for one (as an incitement to leave).
If they accept that, then give it to them (and let them leave), then
destroy the city. If they refuse, then wam them and give them one
year's respite, then destroy it."Z1ZWhen 'Umayr ibn Sa'd came to

360

The Conquests of Sylia, Egypt and Libya

them, he gave them this choice, but they refused, so he gave them one
year's respite, then he destroyed the city.'13

Choosing the place to fight the enemy
'Umar advised Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@ not to engage in fighting
until he had familiarized himself thoroughly with the lie of the land
where the battle was to take place, including water sources and green
areas for grazing the animals, and so on?14 He also wrote to him
before al-Qidisiyah, telling him to stay close to their own land,
because they knew its routes better than the enemy, and in the event
of a defeat they would be able to withdraw and save themselves from
being killed, and the enemy would not be able to catch up with them
because they would be too afraid to follow them and they would not
know the routes in that land?15

In addition to that, 'Umar appointed Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@,
Sahnin al-F%si and Hudhayfah ibn al-Y&
to go ahead of the
army and choose the place for the battle and for the troops to stay.
'Umar (&) distributed administrative tasks among his
commanders216,and stipulated that when selecting a site for their
troops to camp, it should not be cut off from the supreme
headquarters by any body of water, because of the headquarters'
central role in planning and sending reinforcements and supplies.217
'Umar also wrote to Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-J*
saying: "Do not let
them camp in a place before you go and check it out for them and tind
out how it is."21s

Preparing what the troops need of supplies and fodder
'Umar used to send the Muslim troops to Iraq fiom Madeenah
with supplies of sheep and camels for slaughter?" He also supplied
them with mounts from the hima of an-Naqee' and a r - ~ a b d h a h ~ ~ ~
which were to be used for jihad for the sake of Allah. From every
region according to need he would take horses fiom the surplus
wealth of the people, as a precaution to be ready for war. In Koofa
there were four thousand such horses, and a s~milarnumber in Ba~ra,
and horses were kept in every region according to need.'" When
'Umar came to Syria to conclude a peace treaty with the people of
Jerusalem, he established a department to organize supplies for the
m y , which was known as al-&a'. 'Amr ihn 'Ahsah was the first
one who was appointed in charge of supplies for the armies?22
Encouraging them to fight
'Umar wrote to Abu 'Ubaydah, encouraging him to fight in
jihad, saying: "In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most
Merciful. From the slave of Allah 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb, the
Commander of the Faithful, to Abu 'Ubaydah '&nu ihn al-Jar&.

kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you

(Qur 'an 9: 24)
May Allah send blessings upon the Seal of the Prophets and the
leader of the Messengers. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the
Worlds. "223
When this letter reached Abu 'Ubaydah, he read it out to the
Muslims, and they realized that the caliph was encouraging them to
fight. There was no one among the Muslims who did not weep at the
letter of 'Umar ibn al-Khagib.
'Umar also wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqgs and the troops who
were with him in Zraq, urging them to fight and commanding them to
adhere to noble virtues, and forbidding them to commit sin.224It was
also part of the commander's role at the time of 'Umar to encourage
the troops to fight.Z25

Reminding them of the rezuard of Allah
and the nirtue of martyrdom
At the time of 'Umar, Sa'd ihn Ahi Waqq@ stood up in alQ a s y a h and reminded his troops of the reward of Allah, may He be
exalted, and what He had prepared for them in the Hereafter of
delight. He encouraged them to wage jihad and told them of what
Allah has promised His Prophet of divine support and victory of
Islam. He told them of the spoils, booty and land that would soon he
theirs, and he ordered the readers to recite the Soorah of jihad

Similarly, Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - . I d stood and addressed the

And it is well known that 'Amr ibn al-'As said to the army in
Palestine: "Whoever is killed as a martyr and whoever lives will be
blessed." He commanded his troops to recite Qur'an and urged them
to be patient and steadfast, and he encouraged them to seek the
reward of Allah and His ~ a r a d i s e . ~ ~ ~

Obliging them to fulfil the duties enjoined by Allah
'Umar ibn al-KhatJib (4)
wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis and
the troops who were with him, offering the following advice: "I urge
you and the troops who are with you to fear Allah in all
circumstances, for fear of Allah is the best means of preparation to
face the enemy and the best plan at times of war. I command you and
those who are with you to be more cautious of sm than of your
enemy, for the sins of an army are more alarming for them than their
enemy, and the Muslims are only granted divine help because of their
enemy's disobedience towards ~ l l a h . " " ~

He should forbid them to be distracted
by trade, agriculture and so on
'Umar ibn al-Khagb (4)
ordered calls to go out to the
commanders of his troops and inform them that their salary would be
ongoing and provisions would be supplied to their families, and to
tell them not to engage in adculture; he even punished those who
did not obey these 0rders.2~'All of that was because 'Umar (&) was

keen to make his troops focus completely on jihad and spreading
Islam, and not let them become attached to the land that they farmed
so that they became preoccupied with it. Thus 'Umar (&) was able
to develop an army that was devoted to fighting and was ready for
action whenever needed, and he guaranteed that they would not be
scattered to gather finits and engage in other agricultural tasks such
as harvesting, tilling and marketing.z31

4.4. His concern with the borders of the state
'Umar worried about the Muslims and the borders of the
Islamic state, which was expanding. He was reluctant to fight the
Byzantines and when he mentioned them he said: "By Allah, 1wish
that there was a ljme of burning coals between us and them; whatever
was within that line would be ours and whatever lay beyond it would
belong to the ~ ~ z a n t i n e sHe
. " ~said
~ ~the same thing concerning the
border between the Islamic state and Persia: "I wish that between asSaws and the mountains there was a barrier, so that they could not
reach us and we could not reach them. The countryside of as-Sawid
is sufficient for us, and 1prefer the safety of the Muslims to the spoils
of war."233
He ordered that military bases be set up, that would play a
multi-faceted role; we have referred to some of them above. These
would also serve as control centres in strategic locations near the
border between them and the conquered lands, to repel any
aggression fiom without, as well as being centres for the assembling
of troops and for the spread of Islam. Foremost among these centres

365

were the cities of Basra and Koofa, which faced the Persian state, and
al-FusGt in
Other posts on the coasts of Egypt and Syria
were set up to repel Byzantine attacks by sea. He later established
four armies which were known as the army of Horns, the army of
Damascus, the army of Jordan and the army of Palestine. The soldiers
became known by the army in which they served, and the army name
would be attached to their own names, so that the commanders could
tell them apart and so as to make administrative matters run more
smoothly, both during military missions and when paying the
troops.235
This was in addition to the camps and fortifications on the
borders fkom which the enemy had been expelled and which had
been taken over by the Muslims who turned them into military bases
and installed their troops there to protect the borders of the Muslim
state.236
Every time the Muslims advanced, they would set up a border
post in the farthest point they reached to guard the border, and they
filled the post with soldiers who would stay there; the most qualified
leader would be appointed in charge of it?37
Among the most important of these procedures that 'Umar
adopted in Iraq and the eastern regions were the outposts which were
set up between the Muslims and the Persians. When news of the
Persians regrouping under the leadership of Yazdagird reached the
commander of al-Muthanna ibn Hirithah and the Muslims, they
wrote to the caliph 'Umar, telling him of that. The reply came: "Get
out *om amongst the Pemians and scatter among the oases that are on

366

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

the border between your land and theirs." Al-Muthanna carried out
this order.238
Before al-Qidisiyah, 'Umar (&) gave Sa'd this advice:
"When you reach al-Q%isiyah, let your outposts be at the edges of
it.mZ39 In Jaloola', 'Umar wrote to Sa'd saying: "If Allah defeats the
two armies -the army of Mahrih and the army of al-Ancq -let alQa'q? ibn 'Amr advance to the border post of Hulwk with the
Muslim troops, in order to protect the area kom enemy advancement,
and to protect his fellow Muslim troops, whether they are on the
march or in camp."240
Hence the commander Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@ (&) encouraged
his troops in Iraq to advance towards the Persians, &llmg them that
the borders and mountain passes were sealed, and saying, "There is
nothing to fear behind you, so do not worry about being attacked
from the rear."z41
We may note that these outposts that were set up during the
time of 'Umar were only established on the orders of the supreme
commander of the military administration, when the caliph 'Umar
said to the commanders of the outposts: "Distract the Persians &om
your brothers, protect your ummah and your land, and stand guard
over the border between Persia and al-Ahwaz until you receive
further i n ~ m t c t i o u s . " ~ ~ ~
The nmnber of posts in Koofa alone at the time of 'Umar was
four: the post of Hulwin, which was commanded by al-Qa'qi' ibn
'Amr at-Tameemi, the post of Masbadhin, which was commanded

was commanded by 'Umar ibn Milik az-Zuhri, and the post of
Mosul, which was commanded by 'Abdulliib ibn al-Mu'tim al-'Absi.
Each of these commanders had a deputy who could run the post if he
went out on some mission.
It is worth mentioning that whenever the Muslims built a
fortified post or founded a new city, the fust thing they did was to
establish the mosque, because of the role it played in da'wah,
teaching and jihad, as is well known."4
With regard to the guarding of the border between the
Bymtlnes and the M u s h on the Syrian fkont at the time of 'Umar
(&), he also paid attention to that from the onset of the Musllm
conquests in Syria, when he took many defensive measures to protect
the region, such as building watchtowers, establishing border patrols,
setting up outposts and fort~fymgcoastal cities, as well as installing
fighters in the conquered fortresses. He placed the enbre Syrian coast
under a single military command. In the year in which 'Umar himself
went to Syria to sign the peace treaty with the people of Jerusalem, he
checked on some of the Syrian border posts and set up guards and
outposts. He travelled from one to another to see what their defensive
needs were.z45Then he went back to Madeenah, but before he left, he
addressed the people and said: "I have been appointed over you and I
have fulfilled that which Allah appointed me to do for you. In sha'
Allrih we have shared the fay' fairly among you. We have appointed
troops for you, and we have made it easy for you by giving you your

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

When Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarr* conquered A n a i y a h
(Antioch) on the northern border of Syria, the caliph 'Umar wrote to
him saying: "Organize a group of good Muslims to stay in A n w y a h
and protect the city, and do not withhold provision from them.""'
Abu 'Ubaydah transferred some people from Homs and Ba'lbek to
protect the border from any external aggression. He appointed
Habeeb ibn Maslamah al-Fahri in charge of the border post, and he
took the post of A n a i y a h as a base for attacks on regions beyond the
border. Supplies were sent from this post to the fiont lines on the
Byzantine front, and from it was launched the attack on al~ a r j o o m a h 'with
~ ~ whose people apeace treaty was made, stipulating
that they would help the Muslim against the Byzantines, and act as
spies for them and set up outposts in the L k h mountains.249
Similarly, when Abu 'Ubaydah marched to the border post of
B2lis 250,he organized a group of fighters there, and settled it with
Syrian Arabs who had become Muslims after the Muslims had come
there, to guard the border and protect it against Byzantine attacks.251
Other fortifications and defensive methods were adopted by
the governor Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Sutiyk to protect the Muslim
borders on the Syrian coast at the end of the reign of 'Umar ibn alK h a g b and at the beginning of the reign of 'Uthmh ibn

filled them all with troops, allocating land for them and building
watchtowers, where he installed guards to keep watch for the enemy.
Each watchtower had a beacon to inform others that were nearby,
until the news reached the city and other outposts within a short
period of time, so that they could hasten towards the front kom which
the enemy was coming so as to block their advance.255
With regard to the defence of the border between the Muslims
and the Byzantines on the Egyptian fiont during the reign of 'Umar
(&), he paid attention to this as he did to the other fiouts. He
commanded 'Amr ibn al-'& to build al-Fus@ as a military base and
gathering-point for the Muslim troops in the region, and he appointed
someone in charge of every tribe. This was the starting-point for the
Muslim conquests of North Africa, in addition to its being one of the
most important posts for the defence of Egypt, as well as other
missions that it undertook. With regard to its location, as with
previous bases, 'Umar stipulated that there should be no body of
water between it and the central headquarters in the city, so that
communications between them could be ongoing and
straightforward.z56
'Amr ibn al-'Av used to remind his troops that their stay in
Egypt was a kind of guarding the border, as he said: "Remember that
you are in a state of guarding the border until the Day of
Resurrection, because of the large number of enemies around you
who are longing to finish you off and take your land as a source of
agriculture, wealth and many blessings." During the period in which
the Muslim troops conquered the fortresses and outposts along the
Egyptian border, they renovated and repaired them, and made use of
them in guarding the border, stationing troops there. Al-'Areesh was

~ ~ ordered that outposts be
established along the entire Egyptian coast Z58, and when 'Amribn

there to guard it. Their number proved insufficient, which
encouraged the Byzantines to come back by sea, and they killed a
number of the armed men, whilst others managed
. to flee. 'Amrcame
back and conquered the area again, and this time he appointed onequarter of his army to guard Alexandria. He stationed another quarter
to guard the coast, and he stayed in al-FusGt with the remaining
half?59
Every year, 'Umar used to send warriors from Madeenah to be
stationed in Alexandria, and he wrote to the governors telling them
not to neglect that city and to allocate troops to it, in addition to the

vision of protecting and guarding the land borders on the three fronts
of Iraq, Syria and Egypt, was fulfilled?61 Nor was the matter limited
to these defensive means of guardjig the Islamic borders. Rather
'Umar also established the system of summer and winter campaigns,
whereby troops went out every year on regular patrols in the summer
and in the winter, covering all the borders of the Islamic state. Some
of the greatest leaders were in charge of these campaigns, such as
Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - J m , Mu'zwiyah ibn Abi Sufiyk, anNu'&

'Umar increased the supplies and salaries given to those
soldiers who were sent to guard the border posts, so as to help them
put up with their being far away from their homes, and he also
allocated land to them.263'Umar's commanders used to give a share
of the booty to the men who were stationed at the outposts, just as
they gave shares to their own soldiers, because the outposts were a
shield for the Muslims, protecting them against attack from any
direction.'@ When the caliph 'Umar was dying, he offered advice to
the caliph who came after him saying: "I advise the caliph who comes
after me to treat the soldiers in the outposts well, for they are the
shield of Islam; they collect money and annoy the enemy. He should
not take from them anything except that which is surplus to their
needs, with their consent."265

4.5. The relationship between 'Umar and the kings
The relationship between 'Umar and the king of Persia was
one of war. When he died, his soldiers were still pursuing Yazdagird
in his own land and dismantling his kingdom. With regard to his
relationship with the king of Byzantium, the peace treaty between the
two states was concluded after 'Umar had conquered Syria and alJazeerah, and there was an exchange of letters between him and the
king of Byzantium. Arab historians state that this correspondence
was with Heraclius, but they do not say whether it was with Heraclius
I, -From whom 'Umar wrested the land of Syria, or with his son
Heraclius 11, who was known as Heraclius Constantine, because
Heraclius I died in 641 C.E. (21 A.H.), and was succeeded by his son

of the Byzantine Roman state, which brought about an end to the
senseless conflict that had been ongoing between the Byzantines and
the Persians, which has caused the peoples of the region to endure
continuous wars that had exhausted both states, and for which there
was no purpose except to protect the interests of the mlers of both
states.
2. The emergence of a single leadership for this region which lay in

the middle of the earth and extended from the borders of China in the
east to North Africa in the west, and from the Arabian sea in the south
to Asia Minor in the north. This was a new leadership such as
mankind had never seen, subject to the same rules, systemb and
values as other peoples in the region.
3. The domination of a divine system over all people, without
pressuring them to change their beliefs or their religions, and without
differentiatingbetween black, red, white or yellow. Rather all people

373

were equal before the laws of Allah, and the only criterion of
superiority was piety. The people realized the benefits of applying the
laws of Allah in their lives, as that brought safety, stability, blessings
and ample provision, etc.
4. The emergence of a new ummah, which was united by the doctrine

of Tawheed and the laws of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.
The bonds of race, lineage or other worldly factors no longer
mattered. In this ummab emerged leaders of all races, who acquired
with nothing to detract
positions of high status among the d,
from that status. Hence they used to say to those who fought them: "If
you accept our religion, we will leave among you the Book of Allah
as a way of life for you, and provided that you adhere to its rulings,
we will go back and leave your country to
5. There emerged an integrated, balanced and harmonious
civilization, which included within its borders interactions between
nations and peoples who were all subject to the laws of Allah. All
peoples were accepted as members of this civilization, black, yellow
and white, in accordance with the divine system and rulings. 'Umar
became an example of leadership in his time, giving us a shining
example of a knowledgeable, believing, strong man, who used all the
resources of his state, his troops, his followers, his knowledge and all
the means at his disposal to support the religion of AUab and serve
mankind, to make the word of Allah supreme and to bring people
forth from darkness to light, from the worship of men and material
things to the worship of Allah. Thus he fulfilled the words of Allah:

@Those[Muslim rulers] who, if We give them power in the land,
[they] enjoin Iqamat as-Salih [i.e. to perform the five compulsory
congregational Salih (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the

267 Dirrisdt fee

Zakah and they enjoin al-Ma 'roof [i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all
that Islam orders one to do], and forbid al-Munkar [i.e. disbelief,
polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden] [i.e. they make the
Qur'an as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with
Allah rests the end of [all] matters [of creatures].) (Qurhn 22: 41)
The Islamic conquests produced a noble human civilization in
the shade of Islam. Thus we may understand that a divinely-guided
civilization is one in which a group interacts to act as vicegerent on
earth within the framework of Islamic concepts of life, the universe
and man.268

5. The Last Days of 'Umar's Life
The caliph 'Umar was a fine example of a just, believing
caliph, a pions, pure, strong and honest rnujihid, a strong fortress for
the ummah and its 'aqeedah.He spent his entire caliphate serving his
religion and his 'aqeedah and his ummah, which he had been
appointed to lead. He was the supreme commander of the army, and
the faqeeh and mujtahid to whom everyone referred. He was a just
judge and a compassionate father who was merciful to his flock,
young and old, weak and strong, poor and rich. He was a sincere
believer in Allah and His Messenger, a brilliant politician and a wise
and decisive administrator. Under his leadership the smcture of the
-ah
was strengthened, and during his reign the pillars of the
Islamic state were established and the greatest victories were
achieved over the Persians at al-Qidisiyah, al-Madz'in, Jaloola' and
Nahawand. Syria and Egypt were conquered and freed from the
domination of ~ ~ z a n t i u m .Islam

surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. His caliphate was a strong barrier
against tribulation and civil war. 'Umar himself was like a closed
door, and those who sought to stir up tribulation could find no way to
reach the Muslims during his lifetime.270

5.1. Discussion between 'Umar and
Hudhayfah concerning tribulations
(and the approaching breaking of the door)
Hudhayfah ibn al-YanGn (&) said: "We were with Ibn alKhagb (&) and he said, 'Who among you remembers what the
Messenger of Allah @,) said about fitnuh (tribulation)? I said, 'I
remember it as he said it.' He said, 'Tell us, what a great man your
father was!' I said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah @) say, (<'The
tribulation of a man is with regard to his family, his wealth, his own
self, his son and his neighbour, and it may be expiated by means of
fasting, praying and giving charity, and by enjoining what is good
and forbidding what is evil.'), 'Umar said, 'That is not what I mean.
What I mean is the tribulations which will come like the waves of the
sea.' I said, 'What does that have to do with you, 0' Ameer alMu'mineen? Between you and them is a closed door.' He asked,
'Will that door be broken or opened?' I said, 'It will be broken.' He
said, 'Then it will never be closed until the Hour begins.'" Abu
W?il, the one who narrated it kom Hudhayfah, said: "Did 'Urnar
know who was meant by the door?" Hudhayfah said, "Yes. He knew
it for certain." Then Abu W?il said, "Let us ask Hudhayfah who is
meant by the door." We said to Masrooq, "Go and ask Hudhayfah
who is the door." Masrooq asked Hudhayfah, "Who is the door?"
Hudhayfah said, "It 1s mar."^"

Hudhayfah informed 'Umar (&) that he was the strong door
which was preventing tribulation or civil war from engulfing the
Muslims, but this door would be broken, which meant that after that
it would never be closed again until the Hour began. This is what
'Umar understood, namely that tribulations would continue to be
widespread and common among the Muslims and they would never
he able to eliminate them or put a stop to them. Hudhayfah (&) w,as
not stating that of his own accord or expecting it to happen, for he had
no knowledge of the unseen, rather he heard it fiom the Messenger of
Allah &)
.. and understood it and memorized it as he had heard it.
Hence he commented on what he told 'Umar by saying: "I have told
you a hadith and I am not mistaken - i.e., it is a saheeh and lme
hadith, not a mistake or a fabrication - because I heard it from the
Messenger of Allah
Moreover, 'Umar was aware of the facts
that Hudhayfah told hi&, for he knew that his caliphate was a strong
door that was preventing tribulation from engulfing the Muslims, and
that tribulation would never overwhelm the Muslims during his
caliphate and his lifetime.27z'Umar had learned from the Messenger
of Allah @) that he would be killed, and that he would meet Allah as
a martyr. k s ibn M i l k (&) said: cc6'TheMessenger of Allah (g)

'Uthmin, and the mountain shook with them. The Messenger of

the people under my care have been scattered. Take me (in death)
before I commit any act of neglect or heedlessness." Then he went to
~adeenah.~~~

5.1.2. 'Umar's prayer for martyrdom
It was narrated from Zayd ibn Aslam that 'Umar said: (("0'
Allah, bless me with martyrdom for Your sake, and cause me to die in
the land of Your Prophet." According to another report: "0' Allah,
let me be killed for Your sake and die in the land of Your Prophet." It
was asked: "How could that happen?" He said, "AUah may cause it

to
commented on 'Umar's prayer for martyrdom by saying: "Wishing
for martyrdom is mustahabb, and it is different fiom wishing for
death. If it is asked, what is the difference between them? The answer
is that wishing for death is seeking to hasten death before its time has
come, but the longer a man lives the more good he does. Wishing for
martyrdom is asking for death at its proper time, as a martyr; it is not
asking for death to be brought fonvard ftom its appointed time, rather
it is seekiog a virtuous death."276

were stretching up to reach it. 'Umar was three cubits taller than the
others, and I asked, 'Why is that?' He said, 'Because he is one of the
vicegerents of Allah on earth, and he does not fear the blame of any
blamer, and he will be killed as a martyr.' The next morning, I went to
Ahu Bakr and told him about that, and he said, '0' slave, go to Abu
Haf? and call him to me.' When he came, he said, '0' 'Awf, tell him
what you saw.' When I told him that he was one of the vicegerents of
Allah, 'Umar said, 'Does a sleeper see all of this?' He said, 'Tell him
about it.'277 When 'Umar was appointed caliph, he came to alJibiyah and whilst he was delivering a speech, he called me and told
me to sit down. When he had finished his speech, he said, 'Tell me
about your dream.' I asked, 'Didn't you forbid me to speak of it?' He
said, 'I didn't mean it, 0'man.'278 According to another report, he
said, 'Were you not telling lies?' He said, 'No, but I felt shy before

5.1.5. The last Jurnu'ah khutbnh

'Abdur-Ralph ibn 'Awf narrated some of what 'Umar said in
his khutbah on Friday 21 Dhu al-Hijiah 23 A.H., which was his last
khufbah. I have quoted what 'Abdur-Rm2n ibn 'Awf said in my
discussion of how Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq was appointed as caliph in
my biography of Abu Bakr. 'Umar himself told the Muslims of a
dream that he had seen and interpreted it for them. He said in that last
khufboh: "I have seen a dream, and I think it signals my death. I saw
myself being pecked by a rooster twice, and the people were telling
me to appoint a caliph after me. Allah will not cause His religion or
His caliphate to be lost, nor that with which He sent His Prophet. If I
die, then the caliphate is to be decided by a council of these six men
with whom the Messenger of Allah &J was pleased when he
died."282

He had appointed Hudhayfah to estimate the kharij on the land
which was irrigated by the water of the Tigris, and he had appointed
Sahl ibn Hunayf to estimate the kharcij of the land which was
irrigated by the water of the Euphrates. He said to them: "What did
yon do? I am afraid that you may have imposed more that the land
can bear." They said, "We imposed a reasonable amount." 'Umar
said, "If Allah keeps me safe, I will leave the widows of the people of
Iraq needing no man after me." But he was stabbed four days after
this discussion with these two ~ahdbzs.'~~

5.1.7. 'Umar preventing the prisoners
from settling in Madeenah
'Urnar did not give the prisoners from the conquered regions
permission to enter Madeenah, the capital of the caliphate. He
forbade the Magians of Iraq and Persia, and the Christians of Syria
and Egypt, to settle in Madeenah, unless they became Muslim and
entered the faith. This amtude is indicative of his wisdom and
foresight, because these defeated people hated Islam and had plenty
of motives to conspire and plot against Islam and the Muslims. Hence
he forbade them to settle in Madeenah, so as to ward off evil from the
Muslims. But some of the Sahibah (may AUah be pleased with them)
had slaves from among these Christian and Magian prisoners, and
some of them urged 'Umar to give permission to some of these slaves
to settle m Madeenah, so that they could make use of them in their
work. So 'Umar reluctantly gave permission to some of them to settle
in Madeenah, and what he expected and had warned against came to
pass.284

5.2. The murder of 'Umar and the story of the
consultative council (shoora)
5.2.1. The murder of 'Umar (&)
'Amr ibn Maymoon said: "I was standing with no one between
me and him but 'Abdullkh ibn 'Abbk on the day when he was struck.
When he passed between the rows, he would say, "Make &our rows)
straight," and when they were straight, he would go forward and say
takbeer, and he would recite Soorah Yoosuf or an-Nahl, or a similar
Soorah in the fust rak'ah, until all the people had gathered. No
sooner had he said the takbeer, but I heard him say, "The dog has
killed -or devoured -me!" when he was stabbed. The foreigner
(non-Arab infidel) tried to flee, wielding a two-edged knife, and he
did not pass by anyone, right or left, but he stabbed him. He stabbed
thirteen people, of whom seven died. When one of the Muslim men
saw that, he threw a cloak over him and when the foreigner realized
that he had been caught, he killed himself. 'Umar took the hand of
'Abdur-Rwin ibn 'Awf and made him go forward to lead the
people in prayer. Those who were immediately behind 'Umar saw
what had happened; those who were in other parts of the mosque did
not realize, but they missed 'Umar's voice, and they were saying,
"Subhdn-Allrih." 'Abdw-Ralph led them in a brief prayer, and
when they finished, 'Umar said, "0' Ibn 'Abbis, see who killed me."
He went around for a while, then he came and said, "It was the slave
of al-Mugheerah." He asked, "The craftsman?"285 He said, 'Yes."
He said, "May Allah curse him, I told his master to treat him well.
Praise be to Allah Who has not caused my death to be at the hands of
a man who claimed to be a Muslim. You and your father -meaning

al-'Abhk and his son, 'Abdull21 - wanted to bring more infidel
foreigners to Madeenah!" Al-'Abbas was the one who had the most
slaves, and 'Ahdull% said, "If yon wish (we will kill them)." 'Umar
said, 'Wo, that is wrong, after they have learned your language and
started to pray facing your qiblah, and performed Hajj as you do."
'Umar was carried to his house, and we set off with him, and it
was as if no calamity had ever struck the people before. Some
nabeedh was brought to him and he drank it, hut it came out kom his
stomach. Then some milk was brought to him and he drank it, hut it
came out through his wound. They realized that he was dying, so we
entered his house and the people came and started praising him. He
said: "0' 'Abdnllih ibn 'Umar, see what debts I owe." They worked
it out, and the total came to eighty-six thousand or thereabouts, He
said, "If the family of 'Umar can afford it, pay it off from what you
collect from them. Otherwise ask Banu 'Adiyy ihn Ka'b, and if their
wealth is not enough then ask Quraysh, but do not go to anyone else
after them. Pay off this money on my behalf. And go to 'kishah, the
Mother of the Believers, and say, " 'Umar sends you greetings of
peace. Do not say Arneer al-Mu 'mineen, for today I am no longer the
leader of the believers. Say, 'Umar ibn al-Khagb is asking for
permission to stay with his two companions." 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar
said soldm and asked permission, then he went to her and found her
sitting weeping. He said, "Uma ibn al-Kha@h sends you salrims and
is asking for permission to be buried with his two companions." She
said, "I had wanted it for myself, but today I will give it up for him."
When he came hack, it was said, "Abdullih ihn 'Umar has come."
'Umar said, "Lift me up." So a man helped him to sit up and he
asked, "What news do you have?" He said, "That which you want to
hear, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen. She has given permission." He said,
"Praise be to Allah, nothing was worrying me more than that. When I
pass away, carry me there and say: " 'Umar ibn al-Khagb is asking

'Umaribn al-Khattdb

permission to enter. When permission is given to me, carry me in, but
if she says no, then take me to the graveyard of the Muslims." When
he died, we took him out and set off walking. 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar
said salim and said, "Umar ibn al-Khaeb is seeking permission to
enter." 'kishah (@) said, "Bring him in." So he was brought in and
placed there with his two companions.286
There are other reports which describe in detail the events that
are not mentioned in the report of 'Amr ibn Maymoon. Ibn 'Abb%
(4)
said: " 'Umar (4)
was stabbed before dawn, by Abu Lu'lu'ah,
~~
the slave of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah, who was a ~ a g i a n . " ' Abu
Ufi' (&) said: "Abu Lu'lu'ah was a slave of al-Mugheerah ibn
Shu'bah, and he used to make grindstones. Al-Mugheerah used to
deduct four dirhams from him every day. Abu Lu'lu'ah met 'Umar
and said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, al-Mugheerah is taking too much
from me; ask him to reduce it.' 'Umar said, 'Fear Allah and be good
to your master.' 'Umar intended to speak to al-Mugheerah and ask
him to reduce it, but the slave got angry and said, 'His justice extends
to all of them except me.' So he planned to kill him. He made a twoheaded dagger, sharpened it and put poison on it, then he showed it to
al-Hormuzh, and asked, 'What do you think of this?' He said, 'I do
not think you will strike anyone with it but you will kill him.' Then
Abu Lu'lu'ah waited for an opportunity to strike 'Umar. He came to
him at the time of Fajr prayer and stood behind 'Umar. As was his
habit, when the iqimah for prayer was given 'Umar spoke to the
people and told them to straighten their rows, then when he said the
takbeer, Abu Lu'lu'ah stabbed him in the shoulder and then in his
side, and 'Umar fell down."288 'Amr ibn Maymoon (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: "When he was stabbed, I heard him say,

5.2.2. Invention of a new way to
select the caliph after him
'Umar's concern remained focused on the unity and future of
even during the last moments of his life, despite the
the -ah
painful wounds %omwhich he was suffering. Undoubtedly this was a
manifestation of his deep faith, sincerity and selflessness.289During
those critical moments, 'Umar managed to invent a new and
unprecedented way of choosing the new caliph. This is tangible and
clear evidence of hi understanding of the politics of the Islamic state.
The Prophet (&) had passed away before him without clearly
appointing a successor, and when Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq passed away,
he appointed 'Umar after consulting the senior Sahibah. When
'Umar was asked to appoint a successor as he was on his death bed,
he thought for a while, then he decided on a different method that
suited the situation. When the Messenger of Allah @) died, the
people were all agreed upon the superiority and seniority of Abu
Bakr, so the possibility of conflict was remote, especially since the
-shown the ummah, in word and deed, that Abu Bakr
Prophet &)had
was the most qualified to take control after he died. When Abu Bakr
appointed 'Umar as his successor, he knew that the Sahribah were all
convinced that 'Umar was the strongest and most capable of bearing
that responsibility after he was gone. So he appointed him as caliph
after consulting the senior Sahibah, and no one disagreed with him,
so there was consensus and they all swore allegiance to mar.'^^

'Umar ibn al-Khattbb

385

The method of selecting the new caliph was based on limiting
shoora to a specific number of people. 'Umar chose six of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah &), all of whom had been
present at Badr, and all of whom the Messenger of Allah &J had
been pleased with at the time of his death. All of them were fit to
become caliph, even though they varied in their qualifications for the
post. 'Umar also defined the way in which the selection was to be
made, and how long it should take, and he specified the number of
votes that would be sufficient to elect the caliph. He also appointed a
man to watch over the procedures and cast the deciding vote in the
event of equal numbers of votes for different candidates. He ordered
some troops to keep watch over the proceedings and stipulated
punishments for anyone who went against thejam6 'ah. He sought to
prevent disorder by ruling that no one was to enter or listen to what
was going on in the assembly of decision makers.291
There follows a more detailed discussion of these even&:

The number of those appointed
for the shoora, and their names
The number of men appointed was six. They were: 'Ali ibn

Abi Tglib, 'Uthmh ibn 'A% 'Abdur-RAbi Waqqgs, a-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh and T a a h ibn 'Ubaydull2h
(may Allah be pleased with them all). Sa'eed ibn Zayd ibn Nufayl
was excluded even though he was one of the ten who had been
promised Paradise; perhaps that was because he from the tribe of
Banu 'Adiyy (which was 'Urnar's own tribe).z92

The way in which the caliph was to be selected
He commanded them to assemble in the house of one of their
number and consult with one another. 'Abdulla ibn 'Umar was to he
present among them as an advisor only. Prayers were to be led by
Suhayb ar-Roomi during this consultationperiod, and al-Miqd2d ibn
al-Aswad and Abu Talhah al-An$&i were commanded to watch over
the election proceedings.293

How long the selection process took
'Umar (&) stipulated a period of three days, which was
sufficient time. Ifthey took longer than that, it would mean that deep
conflict would spread, so he said to them: "Do not let the fonrth day
come without you having a leader over

This is a report which has no sound isnad. It is one of the weird
stories quoted by Ahu Mukhnaf, and is contrary to the saheeh texts
and what is known of the conduct of the Sahribah. Abu Mukhnaf

people of shoora -and if five agree on a man and one objects, strike
his head with the sword. If four of them agree on a man and two
object, then strike their heads."296 But this is a false report. How

'Umar said to Suhayb: "Lead the people in prayer for three days, and
leave this group of men in a house. When they have agreed upon a
man, then whoever disagrees with them, strike his neck (i.e., execute
him)."300 'Umar (&) issued orders that anyone who tried to go
against this group and cause division among the Muslims was to be
executed, acting upon the command of the Prophet &): cc"Whoever
comes to you when you are united behind one man, seeking to cause
division among you, then execute him.")>301

Ruling in the case of a diference of opinim
'Umar advised them that 'Abdulla ibn 'Umar should be
present with them in the gathering, but he was not to play any role.
But he told them: "If three men approve of one man and three
approve of another man, then refer to 'Abdull31 ibn 'Umar, and
whichever of the two groups he favours, let them choose a man from
among themselves. If they do not approve of the ruling of 'Abdulliih

ibn 'Umar, then go with the group among whom is ' A b d u r - R b i n
ibn 'Awf." He described ' A b d u r - m ibn 'Awfas being wise and
mature, saying, "What a wise man 'Abdur-Rbih ibn 'Awf is, and
how mature. He is guided and protected by Allah, so listen to
him,n302

A group of Muslim soldiers were to watch

over the election and prevent disorder
'Umar said to Abn Tabah al-Ansiri: "0' Abu Tallph, Allah,
may He be exalted and glorified, has supported Islam through you.
Choose fifty men of the Anstir to urge this group until they choose a
man form among their number."303 And be said to al-Miqdid ibn alAswad: "When you have placed me in my grave, bring this group of
men together in a house until they elect one of their number."304
Thus ended 'Umar's life. He did not let the calamity that had
befallen h i or the agonies of death prevent him from organizing the
Muslims' affairs. He set up an unprecedented system for shoora, but
there can be no doubt that the principle of shoora was already
established in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, in the words and deeds of
the Prophet WJ. The Messenger of Allah (@ and Abn Bakr had
already applied this principle, and 'Umar was not introducing
something completely new and innovated. Rather what 'Umar did
was to devise a method for selecting the new caliph, and to stipulate
the number of people from whom he was to be chosen. This was not
done by the Messenger @) or Abu Bakr (&); 'Umar was the first
one to do that and he did well. It was the method that was best suited
to the situation of the Sah6bah at that time.305

5.3. 'Umar's advice to the caliph
who was to come after him
'Umar (&) offered important advice to the caliph who was to
come after him and lead the ummah. He said: "I advise you to fear
Allah alone, with no partner or associate. I advise you to treat the first
Muhijireen well and acknowledge their seniority. I advise you to
treat the An& well, and show approval of those among them who do
well, and forgive those among them who make mistakes. I advise you
to treat the people of the outlying regions well, for they are a shield
against the enemy and conduits of fay '; do not take anything from
them except that which is surplus to their needs. I advise you to treat
the people of the desert well, for they are the original Arabs and the
protectors of Islam. Take from the surplus of their wealth and give it
to their poor. I advise you to treat ahl adh-dhimmah well, to defend
them against their enemies and not burden them with more than they
can bear if they fulfil their duties towards the believers or pay the
jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. I advise
yon to fear AUah and fear His wrath, lest you do anything wrong. I
advise you to fear AUah with regard to the people, but do not fear the
people with regard to Allah. I advise you to treat the people justly,
and to devote yourself to looking after them and protecting them
against their enemies. Do not show any favour to the rich over the
poor. That will be better for your spiritual well being and will help to
reduce your burden of sin, and it will be better for your Hereafter,
until you meet the One Who knows what is in your heart. I instruct
you to be strict with regard to the commands of Allah, His sacred
limits and disobedience with all people, both relatives and others. Do
not show any mercy to anyone until you have settled the score with
him according to his offence. Treat all people as equal, and do not
wony about who is at fault or fear the blame of the blamers. Beware
of showing favouritism among the believers with regard to the fay'

390

that AUah has put you in charge of, lest that lead to injustice. Keep
away &om that. You are in a position between this world and the
Hereafter. If you conduct your affairs justly in this world and r e ~ m
&om indulgence, that will e m you faith and divine pleasure. I advise
you not to let yourself or anyone else do wrong to ah1 adh-dhimmah.
I advise you sincerely to seek thereby the Countenance of Allah and
the Hereafter. I have chosen advice for you that I would offer to
myself or my son. If you do as I have advised you and follow my
instructions, you will have gained a great deal. If you do not accept it
or pay attention to it, and do not handle your affairs in the way that
pleases AUah, that will be a shortcoming on your part and you will
have failed to be sincere, because whims and desires are the same and
the cause of sin is Iblees, who calls man to everything that will lead to
his doom. He misguided the generations who came before you and
led them to Hell, what a terrible abode. What a bad deal it is for a man
to take the enemy of Allah as his fiiend, who calls him to disobey
Allah. Adhere to the truth, strive hard to reach it and admonish
yourself. I urge you by Allah to show mercy to the Muslims, honour
their elderly, show compassion to their young ones and respect the
knowledgeable ones among them. Do not harm them or humiliate
them, and do not keep the fay' for yourself lest you anger them. Do
not deprive them of their stipends when they become due, thus
making them poor. Do not keep them away on campaigns for so long
that they end up having no children. Do not allow wealth to circulate
only among the rich. Do not close your door to the people or allow
the strong to oppress the weak. This is my advice to you, as Allah is
my witness, and I greet you with peace."306

This advice is indicative of 'Umar's farsightednesswith regard
to matters of ruling and administration, which clearly reflects an
integrated methodology and system of ruling and administration.307
This advice covers a number of very important issues and deserves to
be viewed as a precious document because it includes basic
principles of ruling which incorporate the religious, political,
military, economic and social aspects of rule.

5.3.1. Religious aspects
1. Strong advice to fear Allah in secret and in public, in word and
deed, because the one who fears Allah will be protected by Him. "I
advise yon to fear Allah alone, with no partner or associate." "I
advise you to fear Allah and fear His wrath."
2. Imposing the hudood punishments on relatives and strangers alike.
"Do not worry about who is at fault or fear the blame of the blamers"
because hudood punishments are set out by shari'ah and are part of
the religion, and shari'ah is evidence against people, so their words
and deeds will be measured according to it, and neglecting it will
corrupt religion and society.
3. Firm adherence to Islam

$So stand [ask Allah to make] you [Muhammad] firm and straight
[on the religion of Islamic Monotheism] as you are commanded.),
(Qur'an 11: 112)

This is something that is essential in both religious and worldly
terms, and is something that is required of the ruler in both word and
deeds, and also of the people. "Admonish yourself." "Seek thereby
the Countenance of Allah and the Hereafter."

"'AAIdrirah al-Islrimjah fee 'Asr 'Umar ibn al-Khanrib, p. 381

392

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

5.3.2. Political aspects
I. Adhering to justice, because that is the basis of rule, and
establishing justice among the people gives the ruler authority and
respect, and brings political and social stability. It enhances the
position of the ruler in the eyes of the people. "I advise you to treat
the people justly." "Treat all people as equal."
2. Taking care of the first Muslims from among the Muhijireen and
An$&, hecause of their seniority in Islam, and because the Islamic
religion and the political system that is based on it was established as
the result of their striving, and they are its bearers and guardians. "I
advise you to treat the first Muhdjireen well and acknowledge their
seniority. I advise you to treat the Ansir well, and show approval of
those among them who do well, and forgive those among them who
make mistakes. "

5.3.3. Military aspects
3. Paying attention to the army and preparing it properly, because of
the great responsibility that is placed on its shoulders, in order to
guarantee the safety and security of the state. Paying attention to the
needs of the fighters.
4. Not keeping the fighters away fiom their families on the borders
for too long, so as to avoid the boredom, anxiety and loss of morale to
which that may lead. It is essential to give them leave at specified
times and let them go back to their families, so that they will not
cease to produce offspring. "Do not keep them away on campaigns
for so long that they end up having no children." "I advise you to
treat the people of the outlying regions well, for they are a shield
against the enemy."
5. Giving each soldier thefay' and stipend to which he is entitled, in

'Umor ibn al-Kha;g?b

393

order to guarantee a fured income for him and his family, which will
motivate him to fight in jihad and prevent him &om wonying about
his financial affairs. "Do not keep thefay' for yourself lest you anger
them." "Do not deprive them of their stipends when they become
due, thus making them poor."

5.3.4. Economic and financial aspects
6. Taking care to distribute wealth among the people in a just and fair
manner, avoiding anything that could lead to the accumulation of
wealth among one class, to the exclusion of others. "Do not allow
wealth to circulate only among the rich."

7. Not burdening ah1 adh-dhimmah with more than they can bear if
they fulfil their financial obligations to the state. "(Do) not burden
them with more than they can bear if they fulfil their duties towards
the believers."
8. Protecting the people's financial rights and not neglecting them;
avoiding the imposition of more than they can bear. "Do not take
anything ftom them except that which is surplus to their needs."
"Take fi-om the surplus of their wealth and give it to their

5.3.5. Social aspects
1. Taking care of the people, checking on them, meeting their needs
and giving them their rights. "Do not deprive them of their stipends
when they become due."

2. Avoiding selfishness, favonritism and following whims and
desires, because these things pose the danger of the leader being led
astray and leading to corruption in society and the disruption of
308 Al-Khaleefnh a l - F h o q

'Urnor ibn al-Khaffrib by al-'Li, 4. 174, 175.

394

The Conquests of Syria, Egypt and Libya

human relations. "Beware of showing favouritism among the
believers with regard to thefay 'that Allah has put you in charge of."
"Do not show any favour to the rich over the poor."
3. Respecting the people and being humble towards them, young and
old, because this will lift human relations to a higher level and lead
them to unite behind the leader and love him more. "I urge you by
Allah to show mercy to the Muslims, honour their elderly, show
compassion to their young ones and respect the knowledgeable ones
among them."

4. Being accessible to the people, by listening to their complaints,
judging among them and settling scores, otherwise relations will be
adversely affected and there will be instability in society. "Do not
close your door to the people or allow the strong to oppress the
weak."
5. Following the truth and striving to establish it in society in all
situations and circumstances, because this is a social necessity that
must be achieved. "Adhere to the truth, strive hard to reach it." "Treat
all people as equal, and do not wony about who is at fault."
6. Avoiding wrongdoing in all shapes and forms, especially with ahl
adh-dhimmah, because justice is to be established among all those

who come under the state's rule, Muslims and otherwise, so that all
may benefit &om the justice of Islam. "I advise you not to let yourself
or anyone else do wrong to ahl adh-dhimmah."
7. Taking care of the people of the desert and looking afier them. "I
advise you to treat the people of the desert well, for they are the

original Arabs and the protectors of slam."^^^
8. Further advice offered by 'Umar to the one who came after him

'Umar ihn al-Khagfrih

395

was: "Do not leave anyone who was appointed during my reign for
more than one year, but leave al-Ash'ari for four years."310

5.4. The final moments
Ibn 'Abbis (&,) described the final moments in the life of
'Umm when he said: "I entered to see 'Umar when he had been
stabbed, and said, 'Receive the glad tidings of Paradise, 0'Ameer alMu 'mineen, for you became Muslim when the people disbelieved,
and you strove in jihad with the Messenger of Allah @) when the
people let him down. The Messenger of Allah (g)
died when he was
pleased with you, no one disputed your appointment as caliph, and
you have been killed as a martyr.' 'Umm said, 'Say it again.' So I
repeated it to him, and he said, 'By Allah, besides Whom there is no
other god, if I had all the gold and silver in the world, I would pay it
to avoid the terror of what comes after death.'"311 According to a
report narrated by Bukhari, "As for what you have said about having
been a Companion of the Messenger of Allah @) and his having
been pleased with me, that is a blessing that Allah has bestowed upon
me. As for what you see of my worry, that is because I am worried
about you and your companions. By Allah, if I had an earthful of
gold, I would use it to ransom myself £tom the punishment of AUah
before I saw itm3''
'Umar was profoundly a h i d of the punishment of Allah even
though the Prophet (g)
had testified that he was bound for Paradise;
despite that be made great efforts to establish the rule of Allah and
justice, was a great ascetic, engaged in jihad and did other righteous

deeds. This offers an important lesson to the Muslims in general, that
they should remember the stem punishment of Allah and the terrors
of the Day of ~ud~ement.3'~
'Uthmzn tells of the last moments in the life of 'Umar, as he
says: "I was the last of yon to see 'Umar. I entered to see him and his
head was resting in the lap of his son 'Abdull2h ibn 'Umar. He said to
him: "Lay my cheek upon the ground." He said, "Is there any
difference between my thigh and the ground?" He said, "Lay my
cheek on the ground, may you be bereft of your mother," the second
or third time. Then he crossed bis legs and I heard him say, "Woe to
me and woe to my mother if Allah does not forgive me," then his
soul departed?14
This is an example of 'Umar's characteristic fear of Allah, for
his last words were words of woe against himself if Allah did not
forgive him, even though he was one of the ten who had been given
the glad tidings of Paradise. But the one who knows more of Allah
fears Allah more. His insistence that his son lay his cheek on the
ground was a kind of humbling himself in order to glorify Allah,
because that would be more likely to bring a response to his du '6'.

5.4.1. The date of his death and his age at death

twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh of Dhu al-Hg~ah23 A.H., and he was
sixty-three years old accordiog to the correct view."316 His caliphate

lasted a little more than ten and a half years.317In Tar& Abi Zar 'ah
it is narrated that Jareer al-Bajali said: "I was with Mu'iwiyah and he
said, 'The Messenger of Allah @) died when he was sixty-three
years old, and Abu Bakr (&) died when he was sixty-three years
old, and 'Umar (&) was killed when he was sixty-three years
old,, "318

5.4.2. Ghusl, funeral prayer and burial
It was narrated from 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar that 'Umar was
washed and sbrouded and the funeral prayer was offered for him,
although he was a martyr.319The scholars differed concerning one
who is killed unjustly
is he like a martyr so he should not be
washed, or not? There are two views:
-

1. That he should be washed. This report is evidence for those who
are of this opinion.320
2. That he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be
offered for him. Their answer concerning the story of 'Umar is that
'Umar (may Allah be pleased with h i ) lived for a while longer after
he was struck. Ifa martyr lives after he has been struck, even a martyr
who is struck in battle, and eats or drinks or lives-fora long tkne
afterwards, then he is to be washed and the funeral prayer offered for
bim. 'Umar lived for a while afterwards, drinking water and whatever
the doctor gave him. Hence he was washed and the funeral prayer
was offered for him.321

5.4.3. Who offered the funeral prayer for him?
Adb-Dhahabi said that Suhayb ibn S i n k offered the prayer for
him.322Ibn Sa'd said: " 'Ali ibn al-Husayn asked Sa'eed ibn alMusayyib, 'Who offered the funeral prayer for 'Umar?' He said,
'Suhayb.' He said 'How many takbeers did he say?' He said, 'Four.'
He asked, 'Where was the prayer offered?' He said, 'Between the
grave and the ~ninbar."'~'~Ibn al-Musayyib said: "The Muslims
looked and saw that Suhayb was leading them in the obligatory
prayers, on the instruction of 'Umar, so they made h i lead the
funeral prayer for mar."^" 'Umar did not appoint any of the six
candidates for the caliphate to lead the prayer, lest that be seen as an
endorsement of that man by 'Umar. Suhayb was also held in high
esteem by 'Umar and the Sahribah, and 'Umar had said concerning
him: "What a good man Suhayb is; even if he did not fear Allah, he
still would not disobey

5.4.6. The effect of his killing on the Muslims
This event had a great impact on the Muslims, for his death did
not come after a lengthy illness. The impact was made greater by the
fact that it happened in the mosque when 'Umar was leading the
people in Fajr prayer. If we understand the state that the Muslims
were in after this happened, we will realize what an effect it had on
them. 'Amr ibn Maymoon said: "It was as if no calamity had ever
befallen the people before that day. Ibn 'AbbSls went to find out what
had happened after the killing of 'Umar, and he did not pass by any
group of people but they were weeping as if they had lost the dearest
of their children."333
'Umar was a beacon of guidance, a criterion between truth and
falsehood, so it was natural that the people should be affected by his
loss.334The people were clearly affected deeply. It was narrated that
al-&af
ibn Qays said: "When 'Umar was stabbed, he ordered
Suhayb to lead the people in prayer, and to feed them for three days
until they agreed upon a man (to succeed him as caliph). When the
food was served, the people rehined from eating. AlL'Abbb said,
'0' people, the Messenger of Allah
died and we ate and drank
after he was gone, and Abu Bakr died, and we ate. The people cannot
do without eating and drinking.' Then he stretched forth his hand (to
take food) and the people ate."335

a)

When mention of 'Umar was made to 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood
(may Allah be pleased with them both), he wept until the pebbles
grew wet with his tears, then he said: " 'Umar was a fortress of Islam,
the people would enter Islam and not leave. When he died, the

fortress was breached, and now people are going out of slam."^^^
Before 'Umar was killed, Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - J d used to
say: "If 'Umar dies, Islam will be weakened. I would not like to have
all that the sun rises and sets over in return for surviving after 'Umar
is gone." It was asked to him, "Why?" He said, "You will see what I
arn speaking about if you survive. If anyone comes after 'Umar and
tries to rule in the same style as 'Umar, the people will not obey him
or support him, and if he is weak, they will kill him."337

5.5. Lessons learned from the killing of 'Umar
5.5.1. Highlighting the hatred that is hidden
in the kafirs' hearts against the believers
This is indicated by the fact that the Magian Abu Lu'lu'ah
killed 'Umar (g).
That is the nature of the kuffdr in all times and in
all places. Their hearts bear nothing but hatred, envy and resentment
towards the Muslims, and they wish nothing but evil and doom for
the believers. They would like nothing more than for the Muslims to
apostatize from their religion and disbelieve after having become
~ u s l i m s Anyone
. ~ ~ ~ who looks closely at the story of 'Umar's
slaying and what this hate-filled Magian Abu Lu'lu'ah did, will learn
two important things from it which reveal the hatred that this Mfir
held in his heart towards 'Umar and the Muslims. These are:

1. It is proven in at-"abaqrit al-Kubra by Ibn Sa'd, with a saheeh
336 At-Tabaqdf al-Kubra, 31284.

isnad going back to a z - ~ u h r i , 3that
~ ~'Umar said to the Magian one
day, "Have I not been told that you said, 'If I wanted to I could make
a grindstone that is driven by the wind'?" The Magian tumed to hlm
frowning and said, "I shall make for you a grindstone that the people
will talk about." 'Umar tumed to those who were with him and said,
"This slave is threatening me."

2. The second thing which points to the hatred that filled the heart of
this Magian is that when he stabbed 'Umar, he also stabbed thiaeen
Sahdbah, seven of whom died as martyrs. According to the report of
Imam al-Bukhai: (("The infidel foreigner flew with a two-edged
knife and he did not pass by anyone on his right or his left but he
stabbed him, until he stabbed thirteen men, of whom seven
died.">)340Even if 'Umar had wronged h i what had the other
Sahdbah done who were attacked by him? Allah forbid that 'Umar
should have wronged him. It is narrated in the report of Bukhari that
when 'Umar was stabbed, he said: (("0'Ibn 'Abbh, see who has
killed me." He went to find out, then he came back and said. "(It was)
the slave of al-Mugheerah." He asked, "The craftsman?" He said,

Those enemies of Islam who love this Magian Abu Lu'lu'ah
have built a memorial shrine to him in Iran which is similar to the
idea of the 'Vnknown Soldier". As-Sayyid Husayn al-Musawi, one
of the scholars of an-Najaf, says: "In the Iranian city of Kashk, in an
area called B%&i Feen, there is a sbrine like that of the 'Unknown
Soldier' in which there is a fabricated grave for Abu Lu'lu'ah

'Umar ibn al-Khaeb. They call it the 'resting place of Baba Shuj2'
ad-Deen'. Baba Shuj2' ad-Deen is the name that they bestowed upon
Abu Lu'lu'ah for his having killed 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb. On the
walls of this shrine it is written in Farsi, 'Marg bar Abu Bakr, marg
bar ' U m a r , marg bar 'Uthmcin,' which means 'Death to Abu Bakr,
death to 'Umar, death to 'Uthmin'. The shrine is visited by the
Iranian Shi'ah, and money and donations are given to it. I have seen
this shrine myself. The Iranian Ministry of Guidance has started to
expand and renovate it, and they have printed pictures of the shine
on cards to be used for sending greetings and messages."342

5.5.2. The humility and fear of Allah
by which 'Umar was distinguished
One of the signs of this fear which prevailed in the heart of
'Umar just before he was martyred is the words he spoke when he
found out that the one who had stabbed him was the Magian Abu
Lu'lu'ah: ccZ'Praisebe to Allah, Who has not caused my death to be at
the hands of one who claims to be a ~ u s l i m . " r ,Despite
~ ~ ~ the justice
which was one of the qualities of 'Umar (&), which was
acknowledged by near and far, Arab and non-Arab, he was a h i d that
he might have wronged one of the Muslims, who had then taken
revenge by killing him, and would have had something to %we
about before Allah. This is indicated by the report of Ibn Shihib,
according to which 'Umar said: "Praise be to Allah Who has not
caused my killer to have anything to claim before Allah because of a
prostration that he performed." In the report of M u b h k ibn
Faddilah it says: ... to have anything to claim before Allah because

but when 'Umar asked permission for that, she allowed it and gave
preference to him over herself. She said: "I had wanted it for myself,
but I give it up today."348

5.5.4. Enjoining what is good and forbidding
what is evil even on his deathbed
'Umar was concerned with enjoining what is good and
forbidding what is evil, and he did not neglect that even when he was
facing death with all its pain and hardship. A young man entered to
his place when he had been stabbed and tried to console him by
saying, "Be of good cheer, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, for Allah has
given you glad tidings. You were one of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (@) and you served Islam, as you know. Then
you were appointed caliph and you were just, and now you have been
martyred." 'Umar said, "I wish that was enough to get me by, with
nothing for me or against me." When the young man turned to leave,
his izcir (waist wrapper) was touching the ground. 'Umar said, "Bring
the boy back to me." He said, "0' son of my brother, liR up your
garment, for that is cleaner for your garment and is more obedient to
your Lord."349
The fact that he was dying did not keep him ffom enjoining
said, according to the report
what is good. Hence Ibn Mas'ood (4)
narrated by 'Umar ibn Shabbah: "May Allah have mercy on 'Umar;
what he was suffering did not keep h i ffom speaking the

(r&) entered and went near him and said: "0' Companion of the
Messenger of Allah @), 0' in-law of the Messenger of Allah @),
0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar said to Ibn 'Umar, "0' 'Abdulla,
sit me up, for I cannot bear what I am hearing." He leaned him on his
chest, and he said to her, "I urge you by the rights that I have over
you, not to eulogize me after this. As for your eyes (i.e., shedding
tears), I have no power over them."351

It was narrated that Anas ibn M i l k said: "When 'Umar was
stabbed, Hafsah screamed. 'Umar said, "0' Hafsah, did you not hear
the Messenger of Allah (g)
say, (('The one who is eulogized is
tormented?')) Suhayb came and said: "0' 'Umara (a form of eulogy
in Arabic)." He said, "Woe to you, 0' Suhayb. Did you not hear that
the one who is eulogized is tormented?"352His keenness for the truth
even after he had been stabbed and his blood had flowed was such
that when a man said to him: "Appoint 'Abdulls ibn 'Umar as your
successor," he said, "It is not for the sake of Allah that you said
this."353

5.5.5. It is permissible to praise a man
for qualities that he possesses, so long
as there is no fear of fitnah
This was the case with 'Umar, when some of the Sahibah
praised him, because they knew that praising him would not cause
anyfihah (temptation to admire oneself or become arrogant) to him.
Ibn 'Abbis (&), who was a great scholar and faqeeh, said: "Didn't
the Messenger of Allah @J pray that Islam and the Muslims might
be supported by you, when they were living in fear in Makkah?

did not feel proud. Hence he replied to Ibn 'Abb% saying: "By Allah,

5.5.6. The real position of Ka'b al-Ahbk
with regard to the killing of 'Umar (&)
Ka'b al-&b& was Ka'b ibn M M al-Himyan, whose kunya
was Abu Ishiq, but he is best known as Ka'b al-&b%. He was an
adult at the time of the Prophet @J and he became Muslim during
the caliphate of 'Umar in 12 A . H . ~Before
~ ~ becoming Muslim, he
was well known as one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Yemen.
After becoming Muslim he learned the Qur'an and Sunnah from the
Sahribah, and they and others learned stories of ancient nations fiom
him. He went to Syria and lived in Horns, where he died.356
Ka'b al-&b& was accused as conspiring to kill 'Umar ibn alKhaeb. There is a report in at-Tabari from al-Musawwar ibn
Makhramah (4)
which refers to his being accused of killing 'Umar.
In that report it says: "...then 'Umar went to his house, and the next
day Ka'b al-Qb& came to him and said to him, '0' Ameer alMu'mineen, appoint a successor, for you are going to die in three
days.' He asked, 'How do you know?' He said, 'I read it in the Book
of Allah, the Torah.' 'Umar said, 'By Allah do you really find 'Umar
ibn al-Kha@b in the Torah?' He said, 'No, by Allah, but I find a

description of you and your qualities, and it says that your time is up.'
'Umar was not feeling any sickness or pain. The next day Ka'b came
to him and said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, one day has gone and one
day and night are left; the night is yours until moming comes.' The
following moming, 'Umar went out to pray. He used to delegate men
to check that the rows were straight, and once they were straightened,
he would come and say takbeer. Abu Lu'lu'ah came among the
people, with a dagger in his hand that had two heads and its handle in
the middle. He struck 'Umar six times, one of which was below the
navel, and that is the blow that killed him."357
Some modem thinkers concluded tiom this report that Ka'b alA&& took part in the conspiracy to kill the caliph 'Umar ibn alKha@b (&), such as Dr. Jameel 'Abdullih al-Masri in his book
Athar Ah1 al-Kitibfee al-Fitan wa al-Huroob al-Ahliyahfee al-Qain
a l - A w a l al-Hijri, and 'Abdul-Wahhib an-Najjir in his book, alKhulafa' or-Rishidoon, and Prof. G h k i Muhammad Fareej in his
book an-Nishit as-Sirri al-Yahoodi fi al-Fikr wa a l - ~ u m i r i s a h . ~ ~ ~
Dr. b
d ibn 'Abdullih ibn Ibriheem az-Zughaybi refuted the
accusation directed against Ka'b al-A&& by saying:
"What I think concerning this complex matter is that this report
which was narrated by Imam aflabari (may Allah have mercy on
him) is not ~ a h e e hfor many reasons, the most important of which are
as follows:

(4)

1. If this story were true, one would have expected that 'Umar
would not be content to accept what Ka'b said; rather he would have
gathered those Jews who had become Muslim and had knowledge of
the Torah, such as 'Abdulla ibn S a l h , and asked them about this

story. If he had done that, then Ka'b would have been caught out and
his lie would have been exposed to the people, and 'Umar would
have realized that he was involved in a conspiracy to kill him, or he
knew of such a conspiracy. In that case 'Umar would have tried to
uncover it by all means and punish those who were behimd it,
including Ka'h. This is what one would expect of any ruler, let alone
'Umar (&) who was known for his intelligence, sharp wits and
insistence on critically examining any news. But no such thing
happened, which indicates that it is a fabri~ation.3~~
2. Ifthis story was in the To&, Ka'b (may Allah have mercy on him)
would not have been the only one to know it. Anyone who had any
howledge of the Torah, such as 'Ahdullih ibn S a l h (&), would
also have known it?60
3. If this story was true, that would mean that Ka'h had a hand in the
very conspiracy that he was disclosing and that by telling it he was
exposing his own part in the conspiracy. This must be false because it
is contmy to human nature. It is well known that those who are
involved in a conspiracy strive hard to conceal it after it has taken
place, so as to avoid the consequences. Disclosing it before it
happened is something that would only be done by one who is naive
and foolish. This is unlike the character of Ka'b, who was intelligent
and sharp-witted.361

4. Moreover, what does the Torah have to do with predicting people's
lifespans? AUah revealed His Books as guidance for mankind, not for
such purposes.
5. The Torah that is extant at present does not contain any such thing

at all. After noting these fmt four objections, Shaykh Muhammad
Muhammad Abu ~ a h u commented

on them by saying: 'From all
of the above, it is clear that this story is undoubtedly fabricated, and
that the accusation against Ka'b of plotting against Islam by plotting
against 'Umar, and quoting falsely &om the Torah, is a false
accusation for which there is no basis of evidence or proof.' "363
Dr. Muhammad as-Sayyid Husayn adh-Dhahabi (may Allah
have mercy on him) said:
"The fact that Ibn Jareer aflabari narrated this story does not indicate
that it is saheeh, because as is well known, Ibn Jareer did not limit
himself to narrating only those reports which were sound. Anyone

"Moreover, what we h o w about Ka'b al-&b& and his religious
commitment, good character and honesty, and the fact that most of
the authors of Saheeh class him as reliable 367, leads us to conclude
that this story is a fabrication against him. We think that he is above
being a partner in the killing of 'Umar or knowing who was planning
to kill him and failing to disclose that to 'Umar. We also think that he
is above being a liar and fabricator who would try to support what he
was saying about the death of 'Umar by attributing it to the Torah and
making up false Isri'eeli reports? 68... By Allah, Ka'b was falsely

accused and I can say nothing about him except that he is honest and
trustworthy, and he is a scholar whose name was abused and many
reports were attributed to him, most ofwhich are false myths, in order
to make them acceptable to the masses so that the ignorant would
accept them."369

Dr. Muhammad as-Sayyid al-Wakeel says:
"The first thing that the researcher finds to contradict that which was
attributed to Ka'b is the attitude of 'Ubaydullib ibn 'Umar who, as
soon as he heard what had happened to his father, took up his sword
and rushed like a lion to kill al-Hormuzih, Jufaynah and a young
daughter of Abu Lu'lu'ah. Do you think that 'Ubaydullih would
leave Ka'b al-&b% alone if suspicion was swirling about him, and
kill the young daughter of Abu Lu'lu'ah? Anyone who researches the
matter properly could not accept that. In addition to that, the majority
of historians do not mention the story or even refer to it. In atTabaqit, Ibn Sa'd discussed the incident in great detail, but he did not
refer to this incident. All he says about Ka'b al-&b% is that he was
standing at 'Umar's door, weeping, and he said: "By Allah, if the
caliph were to urge Allah to extend his lifespan, He would do so."370
After the doctor had told 'Umar that his end was near, Ka'b entered
and said: "Did I not tell you that you would only die as a martyr, and
you said, 'How can I be a martyr when I am in the Arabian
Peninsula?' "371
Afier Ibn Sa'd comes Ibn 'Abdul-Ban; who makes no mention
at all in al-Istee'cib of the story of Ka'b al-*b%?72

So between the threat and the carrying out of the threat there was no
more than a few hours. How could Ka'b al-abik have gone to
'Umar and said to him what he is supposed to have said, "Appoint a
successor, for you are going to die within three days", then "One day
has passed and two days are left," then, "Two days have passed and
one day is left"? Where did Ka'b get these three days from if the
threat came at night and was carried out the following morning? The

in any manner that would make the researcher feel comfortable

fabricated by some people who wanted to damage Ka'b's reputation
and put the Muslims off him. This is what one may feel comfortable
accepting, especially since we know that Ka'b was a good Muslim

5.5.8. Opinions of some contemporary
scholars and writers
1. Dr. Muhammad Muhammad [sic] a l - F a & the former Shaykh
of al-Azhar, said: "The achievements of 'Umar demonstrate his
political genius and many talents, and his brilliance which is still a
beacon in many area of life, showing how he dealt with the issues and
problems that he faced during his caliphate."391
2. 'Abbis Mahmoud al-'Aqqid said: "This man is one of the most
difficult to criticize or find fault with of the great men whom I have
studied. My book, 'Abqariyat 'Umar - The Genius of 'Umar -is
not a biography of 'Umar or a history of his era l i e other histories
whose main aim to tell of events. Rather it is a description of 'Umar
and a study of various aspects of his personality, which points out the
characteristics of his greatness so as to learn of the potential of man.
'Umar is relevant to the era we are living in, because it is an era in
which power and force are glorified, where the devotees of power
and force believe that power and truth are opposites. But when we try
to understand one great man such as 'Umar ibn d-Khaeb, we could
destroy the concept of glorifying power and strength kom its
foundations, because we would understand a man who was very
powerful, very just and very merciful...This understanding of his
character would offer a cure to those who have any hope of being
cured."
3. Dr Alpnad Shalabi said: "... his striving hard was one of the most
prominent characteristics in the life of 'Umar during his eventful
caliphate. He preserved the faith, raised the banner of jihad,
conquered lands, spread justice among people, established the k t
finance ministry in Islam, formed a regular army to defend the
borders, organized salaries for the troops, created departments,

daily use, organized a mail system, established the hisbah system for
checking on markets, established the Hijri calendar, left conquered
land without dividing it and founded the new Islamic cities."392
4. Counsellor 'Ali 'Ali Mansoor said: "The letter of 'Umar to Abu
Moosa al-Ash'ari concerning judicial matters, fourteen hundred
years ago, is a constitution for judges and those involved in judicial
matters. It marks the highest level that contemporary laws have ever
reached, laws that dictate the ind
process."393

many reasons for the Islamic conquests, heading the list of these
reasons are the qualities of leadership and brilliance enjoyed by 'Umar
ibn al-Kha@b, qualities that are rarely repeated in any era."394
6 . Dr. Subhi al-Ma?nnasini said: "With the end of the caliphate of
'Umar ended the era of the founder of the Islamic state, whose area he
had expanded and whose foundations he had reinforced. He was an
example of a wise and determined leader, a responsible 'shepherd', a
just, strong, kind and compassionate ruler. Then he died, a victim of
duty, a martyr to truth and righteousness, so he is with the qiddeeqs
and the righteous, the close fiiends of Allah. The name of 'Umar ibn
al-Kha@b will remain forever as a beacon in the history of
civilization and fiqh."395

7. Shaykh 'Ali at-Tan@wi said: "The more I study the life of 'Umar,
the more my admiration for him increases. I have read the

Muslims, and I have found among them those who are great in
thought, or great in eloquence, great in attitude or great in legacy. But
I found that 'Umar combined all aspects of greatness. He was great in
thought, attitude and eloquence. If we were to list the greatest
fuqaha ' and scholars, 'Umar would head the list If he had nothing
but his fiqh, he would still be a great man. Ewe were to make a list of
speakers and orators, 'Umar would be first on the list. If we were to
list brilliant IegisIators, or military leaders, or successful
administrators, 'Umar would be at the forefront of each category,
a great man in every aspect. If you were to study the great men who
have built states, who left a legacy behind on earth, you would hardly
find anyone greater than 'Umar. Above all, he was a great man in
attitude, a great man in and of himself. 396

5.5.9. The opinions of some of the
orientalists concerning 'Urnar (&)
1. Muir says in his book The Caliphate: "Simplicity and devotion to
duty were among the most important principles of 'Umar. One of the
most prominent chmcteristics of his administration was the absence
of bias. He understood the true meaning of responsibility and his
sense of justice was very strong. I i c &d not favom a y m e when
choosing workers. Even though he used to cany his stick with him to
punish sioners straight away, so that it was said that the stick of
'Umar was harsher than the sword of any other man, he was a gentlehearted man, and there are many incidents that demonstrate his
compassion, such as his compassion towards widows and
orphans."397

2. The Encyclopaedia Britannica says concerning him:"Umar was a

'Umar ibn al-Kha@

419

wise and farsighted ruler, who did a great service for slam."^^^
3. Professor Washington Irving said in his book Muhammad and His
Successors:

"The life of 'Umar, ffom beginning to end, shows that he was a man
of great brilliance who was committed to righteousness and justice.
He is the one who laid the foundations for the Islamic state and
carried out the wishes of the Prophet &).
- He supported Abu Bakr
with advice during his short caliphate, and he laid strong foundations
for a decisive administration in all the lands conquered by the
Muslims. The strong hand which he laid on the greatest of his
beloved commanders in distant lands is the greatest evidence of his
extraordinary ability to rule. In his simplicity of lifestyle and his
rejection of luxury he was following the example of the Prophet (g)
and Ahu Bakr. He followed in their footsteps when writing and
issuing instructions to his commanders."399

4. Dr. Michael Hart said:
"The legacy of 'Umar had a great impact. He was the main
personality behind the spread of Islam after Muhammad @).'O0
Without his rapid conquests it is doubtful whether Islam would have
spread in the manner in which it is known today. In addition to that,
most of the lands which he conquered have remained Arab fiwm that
time until now. It is clear that Muhammad &)played the major role
in this, but it would be plainly wrong to ignore the role of 'Umar and
his leadership."401

398 Op. cit, p. 55.

3W bid.

It s e e m that Mr. Michael Hzut is unaware of the biography of Abu Bakr
as-Siddeeq (may Allah he pleased with him).
It is also plainly m u g to ignore the role of Abu B a k ~and his leadership
after the death of the Messenger of AUah (bpuh).

The Conquests of Syria, E~gyptand Libya

Conclusion
With the death of the Rightly-Guided Caliph 'Umar ibn alKhagb (&) a great era of history came to a close. History knows
him as a brilliant man of unique character. His main aim was not to
accumulate wealth or seek the luxury of power; his position of
authority did not make him drift away from the right path and he did
not allow his relatives or sons to abuse people. Rather his main aim
was to support Islam, and his greatest wish was that shari'ah would
prevail. All he wanted was to achieve justice among the people under
his care. He achieved all of that with the help of Allah, may He be
glorified, during that brief period which is regarded as nothing in the
lifetime of a natioa402
Studying this biography gives the new generation a brilliant
example that brings back to life the glory of former days and teaches
them that the last generations of this -ah
will not be guided by
anything other than that by which the first generations were guided.
This will help dd 'iyahs and scholars to follow the example of the era
of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and understand the main
characteristics of that era and its Nlning of people's affairs.
This will help the urnmah to resume its role at the forefront of
civilization.

I ask Allah to accept this work and to bless it and cause it to be
of benefit to people. Allah, the Exalted says:
dWhatever of mercy [i.e. of good], AUah may grant to mankind, none
can withhold it; and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it
thereafter. And He is the AU-Mighty, the All-Wise.b
(Qur 'an 35. 2)

'Umar ibn al-Khaggib

421

I hope that every Muslim who reads this book will not forget to
say du '6' for its author who is in need of the forgiveness and mercy
of his Lord. Allah, the Almighty says:
(My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for
Your Favours which You have bestowed on me and on my parents,
and that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You, and
admit me by Your Mercy among Your righteous slaves.)
(Qur'an 27: 19)

Glory and praise be to You, 0'Allah. I bear witness that there
is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You. And the
close of my prayer is: "F'raise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."
